                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  As I was saying, this is an extra tax grab of $900 million. Basically, it is the government with its hands in the pockets of Australians. This is Robin Hood in reverse. While it may be understandable to some that a government and a Treasurer that have totally lost control of their fiscal policy would be desperate to rip every dollar that they can out of the pockets of Australians, the fact that they attempt to hide it through this bill is what frustrates and angers the community and certainly leads them to not trust the duplicitous actions of this government. More than half the Gillard government's promised surplus 2012-13—and I said 'promised'—is to be achieved through the increased revenue from this bill. This is the sole purpose of the government removing this money from your accounts. This is what the government is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Its addiction to spending has left it unable to balance its budget. The government will, as it has so often previously, resort to negative comparisons to somehow justify this incompetence and its wasteful spending. How often have we had to listen to the Treasurer basically gloating that Australia's debt position is not nearly as bad as that of other nations? It is an absolute nonsense argument: 'We might be in a bad way, but others are worse, so that makes it fine.' This government is saying that, although they have propelled Australia down a hole, we are not as deeply down that hole as perhaps somewhere like Greece or other at risk nations, so that should give us some comfort. That is a farce perpetrated on us all by a Labor government in a desperate state. And they are looking at walking away from that budget surplus promise—just watch this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was in a good financial position. The previous Liberal government left the current one with a budget surplus, no net debt and billions of dollars invested in savings. The Labor government did what Labor governments do: they spent all the money and wasted so much of it. They are now gorging on debt. Through our amendments, the coalition is seeking to fix what is just the latest legislative debacle from this government. Our amendments seek to redefine the appropriate timeframes needed for fairness in this process. For example, the three-year inactivity threshold for bank accounts is far too short. I have articulated any number of reasons why your account may not have been active over that period. That definitely should be reviewed. The most appropriate period needs to be reassessed. There also needs to be a better explanation as to why the first homeowner account is included. It is just an extraordinary inclusion. Many aspiring homeowners struggle to attain that much-needed deposit. They are working so hard and we should be encouraging such people, not making it harder for them, not having them live in fear: 'If you don't make a contribution to that account, then the government will take it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also questions about the range of accounts captured by this legislation. It remains the position of the opposition that the new rules should apply only to accounts that earn very low or zero interest, typically at-call accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition also believe that accounts should be grouped under account holders so that if someone has one or more active accounts which are currently in use, then any inactive accounts should not be claimed by the government. They are working their accounts; it is how they are working their financial affairs. In such circumstances, the account holder is obviously known to the banking institution and their account is not lost; it is simply inactive. And that is okay and should be okay with this government. It is not okay for the government to take your funds in that instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already acknowledged that this latest piece of legislation is flawed. I wonder why the government cannot get its work done right the first time. Why can't it do the work that is necessary to get this type of legislation right? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has put out a media statement outlining a months delay in implementing the bill, which will now come into effect on 31 May next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just another example of the government's incompetence. We also know that further delays will almost be inevitable, as the government struggles to get its act together. The government also needs to tell the House and the banking sector how these amendments will change the financial impact of the bill over the forward estimates. We need to know more about this and so do the people of Australia. Let us hope that the government actually tries to improve this legislation and bring it into this House in the form it should have brought it in in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that the coalition are proposing certainly deserve support.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="PK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RANDALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Let us be clear about what this bill is about. For those listening out there in the wider Australian audience, this is about a government that is trying to legitimise the ability to put its hand in the pockets of everyday Australians and take moneys out of superannuation accounts, home saver accounts and a whole range of accounts that have been inactive for some time. As the member for Forrest just explained to us, the problem is that the government has reduced the time thresholds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having an inactive account is not a sin, it is not illegal and it is not wrong. There are a whole range of reasons why you might have an inactive account. But the government, because they need to prop up the bottom line, because they know that they are in financial trouble—they have this fascination with a $1.1 billion surplus, which they know is just a fantasy—but to make it look good they are rushing this legislation through the parliament today, without industry consultation and without proper scrutiny by the Senate's Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The joint committee wanted to examine this bill and it has not been given the opportunity and time to do so in any meaningful way. So it has been rushed through today because, at the MYEFO update only weeks ago, Treasurer Wayne Swan said he wanted to grab this money to prop up the government's bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has financial problems; it is running out of money. The fact that it is borrowing $100 million a day from China is not enough. It now wants to raid the bank accounts, the superannuation accounts and home saver accounts of ordinary Australians who are out there in the wider community. So we are going to reserve our position on this bill until the outcome of a further Senate inquiry, at a date to be announced. This is desperate legislation and it is quite unseemly that it would be in this place today. This year the amount of unclaimed money held by ASIC has risen to $677 million and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, is licking his lips in anticipation because he wants to get this money—after squandering the money he had been given through the taxation system. This bill seeks to reduce the length of time unclaimed money sits in an account before it can be transferred to government coffers. In other words, it would expedite this government getting their hands on money which Australians are entitled to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if we had made such a money grab. Imagine if Peter Costello had done this. You would have heard a hue and cry: 'What are you doing to the workers of Australia? What are you doing to the ordinary mums and dads of Australia? You are raiding their bank accounts. You are raiding their home saver accounts. You are raiding their superannuation accounts.' We would have been, in the words of those on the other side, the ultimate Tory thieves helping ourselves to Australians' moneys. But, as the Prime Minister says, 'This is the Labor way.' It is the Labor way today—helping themselves to this money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced the last time we met—three weeks ago. It was introduced, I understand, on the Tuesday night. I happened to be on duty in the chamber on the Wednesday morning when it was brought to this House. The shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, was here ready to speak on this bill and he was furious because he had only received notification that it was coming into this House the night before. There had been no opportunity to consult with industry. Given the complexities and the significant implications associated with the bill, the coalition sought to have the bill referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. A meeting of that committee was called immediately and at that meeting it was decided that the bill should be referred to the committee for review. As I said, on the Wednesday that decision was respectfully overturned by the Speaker and it became clear that the government wanted the bill passed that week.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Speaker, but I did happen to be in the chamber at the time. I will leave it there. Given the consequences of this legislative amendment, it would have been wise for this bill to have been carefully examined before a vote was held. Given the Labor government's desperation to secure more revenue, however, I can see why such scrutiny was bypassed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many Australians who would be affected by this proposed legislative amendment. An article titled 'The quest for buried treasure', written by Lesley Parker and published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> on 14 November, shows that the average parcel of unclaimed funds in Western Australia is the highest in the country at $791. I do not know why that is, but our state—I happen to be a member from Western Australia—seems to be leading the charge in quite a few areas. While there are many inactive accounts which have only very small amounts of unclaimed money sitting in them, there are many examples where significant sums of money rest in an account without the knowledge of the account holder. In Western Australia, for example, there is an account with an unclaimed balance of almost a million dollars. The government has decided, through this proposed legislation, that this money should be redirected to federal coffers as a matter of urgency. Anyone in this place who takes even a cursory glance at this proposal will know that it warrants further scrutiny—especially given the number of Australian account holders who will be impacted by this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many thousands of my constituents in the Canning electorate would, because they are superannuants or self-managed superannuation fund holders, demand that parliament investigate the implications of a tier of government claiming money from Australians before we rush ahead with such a proposal. As I will come to later, this bill has unintended consequences—for example, where there is health insurance linked to a superannuation fund. This is a sadly accurate reflection of the disregard the Gillard government have for taxpayers' money. It is apparently not enough for them to recklessly waste the money which, as I said, is given to them through our taxation system and through the revenue the Commonwealth attracts; now they wish to rush through a process which will result in additional money being effectively placed in trust with the government—I emphasise the word 'trust'. It will be handed over to the government and held, but the government have a terrible track record with the responsibility of handling public funds. With the speed at which it is being rushed through the parliament, the coalition objects to this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will have major implications for unclaimed bank accounts, life insurance policies, which I did not mention earlier, a range of superannuation accounts, home savers accounts and unclaimed company moneys. It seeks to allow the government to gain control of moneys in people's inactive accounts after three years. Currently it is seven years. So after three years they are coming for you. It also allows the government to gain control of workers' unclaimed superannuation money where an account has been inactive for 12 months—12 months, rather than five years. What if you have been up north on a contract and you just have not got around to tending to your self-managed superannuation fund, for example?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inactive First Home Saver Accounts and life insurance funds are also under attack by the Gillard government. What about parents who establish a First Home Saver Account for their children? Have they thought of this unintended consequence? Parents with a bit of money who want to do the right thing by their young child so that they can get into the home mortgage market later in life may put it into a home saver account. Unfortunately, as things go on and bills get bigger, they may not put any money into this home saver account for their child and it may go inactive for several years because of financial circumstances. Goodness me, the government has come and got it!</span>

They will come back to Australia and find that, because their account was inactive and they were working almost in a charitable fashion, not earning, they have been hit. What about soldiers sent overseas? I am not talking about soldiers in Afghanistan or on peacekeeping missions but those who go away to other areas where they might sign on for a longer period of time. When they come back after 12 months: goneski—not the Gonski that most people know but the goneski that will happen to their account.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we can see that this bill will have major ramifications for many Australians. It is incumbent upon this parliament to rigorously explore the implications of the bill rather than rush it through both houses, as is the apparent intention of the government today. We often hear about the new era of transparency, with this 'rainbow coalition' that was cobbled together in 2010. Dare I refer to the time I sat in this chamber three weeks ago, when the member for Lyne was occupying the chair? He wanted to leave the chair because he was not happy with the bill and wanted to contribute to debate. We helped facilitate it. The Greens member for Melbourne said the Greens were not happy with this bill because it had suddenly been thrust upon them as well and they had not seen the detail. Obviously, in recent times they always protest and then eventually roll over and have their tummies scratched by this government and go along with it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition opposes this bill because we do not want this to be added to the growing list of embarrassing examples where transparency has been discarded for political expediency. And we know what they are: the formulation of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax; and the failure of the Labor government to deliver on the single promise with the country Independents to introduce spatial accounting, to help understand federal expenditure in the regions of Australia. I will just briefly expand on that, because this is part of the transparency. With great fanfare the Independent members said that, along with Minister Crean, they would involve themselves in what is called spatial accounting, so that we could see where the money was spent in each electorate in the regions. We have asked the questions now, and they cannot do it. I think it is that they do not want to do it. And how about the bungling of the Australia Network tender; the reversal on the carbon tax floor price; and the ongoing deals with the Greens to maintain power. It is all part of a shambolic government, and this legislation is part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, yesterday I spoke with industry people and industry sources about this issue and they are deeply concerned about the speed with which this bill has been rushed through the parliament without proper scrutiny. One of the unintended consequences raised with me was the implication involving insurance policies associated with superannuation funds. Many Australians with superannuation accounts have health insurance policies connected their super policies. A client's ability to lodge a claim through their policy would be taken away if their account were claimed by the Commonwealth after remaining inactive for several years. The fact that it is inactive does not mean to say that the health funds still could not come out of funds that were in there. This has massive implications for many Australians, and the government should respect the fact that their suggested legislative amendments need to be adequately scrutinised to ensure their actions do not lead to negative outcomes for Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The bill before the House seeks to enact various changes to unclaimed money measures, which were flagged in the government's 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes amendments in five areas: the Banking Act 1959; the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008; the Life Insurance Act 1995; the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001; and the Corporations Act 2001. The bill effectively brings forward the time at which money is recognised under the relevant law as lost or unclaimed, which will in turn have the effect of moving approximately $700 million into the federal government's general consolidated revenue fund for the 2012-13 financial year and beyond. Make no mistake, these bills are merely a cover-up for this disastrous Gillard Labor government. They are designed to cover up $172 billion of accumulated deficits—record deficits—with more deficits likely to come in the 2012-13 financial year and beyond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in today's bill are one of many so-called saving measures announced by the Treasurer in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. As we know, the vast majority of what the Treasurer referred to as a saving was merely taking more money away from Australian taxpayers and businesses—and taking it away sooner than the government did previously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, after which stakeholders had five working days to make a submission to the committee. As Labor does with so many important pieces of legislation, similar to the rushed implementation of their Future of Financial Advice rules, they rammed their measures through parliament without any regard to the intended and unintended consequences of their legislation. In this case, for a measure to be worth potentially up to $760 million, there were only 18 days between referral to the committee and the committee's report being released. This is simply not enough time for those interested—consumers, business groups and industry associations—to consider the consequences of these changes. The coalition senators of that committee released a dissenting report which highlights many of the bill's problems. They made two recommendations: firstly, that the government withdraw the bill in order to facilitate further consultation and that the explanatory memorandum be revised to be clear about how the legislation is intended to work; secondly, if the government does not withdraw the bill—which it has not done—that the bill be amended to delay implementation until at least 31 December 2013 for Schedules 1 and 2 and that there be further delay for Schedule 4. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, the government announced just yesterday afternoon significant changes to the bill in response to many of the concerns noted by the coalition senators' dissenting report. It takes seven paragraphs into the media release of the Parliamentary Secretary for the Treasurer, the member for Oxley, for the government to admit that it is making significant changes to the original legislation and to then admit that it is changing the implementation date to 31 May 2013. What it does not say is that the original date in the legislation was 30 April 2013. So all organisations affected by this legislation will be given a total of just one extra month to implement costly reforms and introduce compliance regimes. As I have noted, the coalition believes that one month is not enough. Authorised deposit-taking institutions—ADIs—first-home saver account providers, life insurers and superannuation funds need and want at least a year. However, this Labor government does not listen to stakeholders. It pays lip service to their concerns by giving them one extra month to significantly alter system-wide processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a symptom of what the coalition has been saying all along about this legislation. The government has abused process with the manner in and timing with which this bill was introduced into parliament. Most fundamentally, the government must update the explanatory memorandum and be upfront about the impact this legislation and its subsequent changes will have over the forward estimates. The government has not yet done so. It is more interested in rushing through the legislation, making hurried changes and leaving it to the industry and consumers to worry about the consequences afterwards. This hurried process did not have to happen. From the outset, Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions told the committee that the government should delay implementation. The coalition senators noted the response of the Australian Bankers' Association, which acknowledged that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…the proposed timing for implementation and a commencement of 31 December 2012 is unrealistic, being in less than 2 months and falling during a period when banks implement freezes on any technology or IT systems changes. It is estimated that banks and other ADIs will require at least 6 months to make all the necessary changes, inform customers in a legally compliant manner, and meet compliance requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to look at the individual sections of the bill. Firstly, Schedule 1 of the bill amends section 69 of the Banking Act 1959 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions. These changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an ADI is treated as unclaimed money from seven years to three years. The test of engagement the government has chosen in determining whether an account is to be treated as unclaimed money is whether a transaction has occurred in the account for that period of time. What is even more alarming is that until yesterday the inactivity test would have been applied at the account level, not the customer level. So we could have ended up with the situation where an active customer with a pre-existing relationship with an ADI had several accounts but might have had one account that they were not using. For that one single account, the money would have been deemed 'inactive' and transferred to consolidated revenue, despite their being an active customer. This change had potential widespread consequences for many Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow Treasurer has highlighted to the House, there might be many examples of an Australian worker who has been offered a post overseas for three years, who has money sitting in a bank account, who leaves their money in that account accumulating interest and who does not make any further deposits or withdrawals in that period. For the purposes of this bill, their deposit is treated as unclaimed funds and therefore is able to be transferred into consolidated revenue. The coalition still has deep reservations as to the potential unintended consequences that this legislation may have for many Australians with untouched funds in bank accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, Schedule 2 to of this bill amends the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by first-home saver account providers. The new law amends sections 17A and 51C of the FHSA Act to change the unclaimed funds period from seven years to three years. Since the introduction of First Home Save Accounts in the 2008-09 budget, the Australian economy has continued to grapple with the effects of the global financial crisis. Many Australians may have started up a first-home saver account and then been affected by economic circumstances such as rising cost-of-living pressures, and therefore they may not have been able to make contributions. Today's bill means that some of these accounts are at risk of being claimed by the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, schedule 3 of the bill amends section 216 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 to provide for the new arrangements for unclaimed life insurance funds. Unclaimed moneys include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of the policy. The new arrangements will reduce the period from seven years to three years before life insurance funds are treated as unclaimed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, schedule 4 of the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to change arrangements for the transfer of lost member accounts to the tax office and to provide for the payment of interest on unclaimed superannuation money. Lost superannuation with balances of less than $2,000 will be deemed inactive after only three years; currently it is seven years. The coalition's dissenting report notes that this has the potential to make worse off those already vulnerable in our community—that is, those who take the most time to accumulate anywhere close to $2,000 in a superannuation account. We are talking about young people, low-income earners and new earners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very concerned about the reduction in the time of inactivity from five years to only 12 months. Yesterday afternoon, the government acknowledged this problem in their legislation and announced that accounts which are active but where the member is uncontactable will not be transferred to the ATO. This is an embarrassing turnaround from the government. I am glad that they finally acknowledged the concerns relating to the nature of superannuation accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many young people and low-income earners will have multiple jobs and multiple super funds. The immediate pay packet of someone earning a low wage might be more pressing in terms of updating addresses and other contact information. Yet, if they then move house—and even if their super account is still receiving contributions—their account can be deemed lost if communication has been attempted twice. Therefore, to assist in protecting active but lost accounts, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and the Financial Services Council recommended a minimum two-year period before an account can be deemed lost, and that the two-year clock be reset when a member receives a contribution or any form of contact has occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very reasonable proposition which would add a safeguard for Australian superannuation accounts. I reiterate my gratitude that the Labor government has at least listened to the concerns from industry and consumers so that active accounts will not be transferred to the ATO unnecessarily.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifthly, schedule 5 of the bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. We should consider today's bill in the wider context of tax reform—more precisely, the complete lack of fundamental tax reform over the last five years. The Rudd Labor government first commissioned the Henry tax review, which began in 2008. The review received more than 1,500 submissions, cost more than $10 million and finally delivered a report over 1,300 pages long. The report included 138 recommendations to the government, the vast majority of which have not been appropriately considered by the government. Instead, we have a record of no real reform and all we see is new taxes and tax increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Successive Labor governments have introduced an additional 20,900 regulations and only repealed 104. Labor promised that they would follow a strict 'one in, one out' approach to the growth of regulation. Instead, for every regulation removed, 200 regulations have been added. While the Treasurer wants to rush this unclaimed money bill through parliament, they do have form when it comes to rapidly raising taxes in Australia. Among many other things, in 2008 they increased the alcopops tax and raised the luxury car tax from 25 to 33 per cent. They have attacked superannuation on numerous occasions. They attacked the medical expense tax offset and abolished the entrepreneur tax offset, and their most recent reform was to force large businesses to pay their pay-as-you-go instalments to the government every month instead of every quarter. This measure is supposed to net the government $5.5 billion in the next financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mining companies were slugged with a mining tax that has, to date, not raised a single dollar in revenue. With the mining tax, Australian businesses were supposed to see a cut in the company tax rate of 30c to 29c and then to 28c per dollar. The company tax rate today still stands at 30c, and Labor has completely abandoned reform in this area. As a result, the government has amended the net debt ceiling limit four times in the last five years. It first increased the limit in 2008 to $75 billion, then again in 2009, 2011 and 2012, with the limit now standing at $300 billion. As a consequence we have a government that then has to introduce measures in today's Treasury legislation amendment bill—a short-term fix to raise more than $760 million to smooth over the budget figures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, these changes have been rushed and ill-considered. The last 24 hours has seen the Labor government confess that it has introduced deeply flawed legislation, something it does not admit to very often, although there are countless examples of legislation passed by the Labor government which should not have been introduced, let alone passed, and which has required significant revision after its passage. With this Treasury bill, the government must at the very least delay the implementation of the bill and listen to the concerns of all stakeholders before imposing unnecessary and additional compliance cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shortcomings that I and my coalition colleagues have outlined, both in the Senate dissenting report and in parliament, must be addressed in the form of further consultation. Despite the changes announced yesterday, this bill is still a bad bill. I therefore strongly oppose today's bill in its current form.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. As the shadow Treasurer has said, this bill should not be called the 'unclaimed money bill'; it should be called the 'government claims your money bill'. I guess you could also call it 'use it or lose it'. Anyone with a bank account should rush out and put in 10c to make sure the account is active. For one of my accounts I will probably have to do that because it is a family trust declared account. It is on my register of interests. It has been sitting there and earning interest for the family trust but it has not been activated or used for four years. That means it will be claimed by the government. This is another typical example of a government putting up a bill when it does not understand the consequences; it does not think through any of the legislation. If there is one thing that the business community knows it is that the government does not understand the knock-on consequences of a lot of the bills that are introduced and how they affect business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially this bill is an attempt to manufacture a paper surplus for this current financial year in the face of predictions from analysts around the country that there is going to be no budget surplus. In fact, more than half of the Gillard government's promised surplus for 2012-13 is supposed to be achieved through increased revenue from this bill. The government is clearly worried that it will break yet another political commitment that has been repeated time and time again by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Those opposite are desperate for cash.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all support getting the budget back to surplus, but the coalition wants a real surplus, not a paper surplus. The context of the legislation is the four largest deficit budgets in Australia's history, remarkably coming after four of the largest surpluses at the end of the prosperous Howard era. The rushing of this legislation will impose costs which will be borne by the account holders and consumers, and we must consider the interests of consumers who are the holders of bank accounts, superannuation accounts and insurance accounts while we assess the merits of this bill. On the other side of the coin are the account providers: banks, super funds, insurance companies or other financial institutions which are having the ill-considered measures imposed upon them without warning or consultation. We heard the Assistant Treasurer at a recent function in Melbourne talk about the Labor government and how much consultation it undertakes with business, but this bill is typical and it shows that the government does not consult with people when bringing in bills. Inadequate warning or consultation is stated in the coalition's dissenting report to the Senate inquiry. The stated objectives of this legislation are sound: to prevent erosion of small, lost or inactive account balances from fees and charges and to reunite unclaimed balances with their owners. However, as with many Labor bills, the substance of the bill does not match the objectives. We had the same problem with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill, which I spoke about in September—a bill with stated intentions that no-one could disagree with but with consequences that almost everyone disagreed with. This bill has the same problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, while it was possible to conclude that the charities legislation debacle was just another example to add to the list of incompetence in the Labor Party, with the pink batts and the school halls, this legislation is more of a deliberate attempt to mislead. It is a grab for cash; there can be no doubt about that. The costs imposed on account providers from this legislation, which will be far greater due to the rushed nature of the introduction of the legislation, will inevitably be passed on to consumers—and I think the last thing Australians will want to see at the moment is higher bank charges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will move amendments to introduce more realistic implementation time frames, and if these amendments are successful we will not oppose the bill. There may well be some elements in this bill that have merit, but these are largely wiped out by the rushed, ill-considered and disorderly manner in which they are being pursued. Specifically, given the number of problems raised concerning the legislation, the coalition senators of the Economics Committee determined that the sensible decision would be to undertake further consultation and, failing that, the implementation dates for schedules 1, 2 and 4 should be delayed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that at the eleventh hour the member for Oxley, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is in the chamber at the moment, has flagged changes that push back the reporting and transfer deadlines by a month for both banks and superannuation funds. While it is positive that the government has recognised one of the elements of concern with the legislation, this does not appropriately address the concerns that were raised by industry. From the outset we say that the government needs to explain, in an updated explanatory memorandum to this bill, how these changes will impact the key dates as outlined in the explanatory memorandum for changes in schedules 1, 2, and 4. The government also needs to inform the House, in an updated explanatory memorandum, how these amendments will change the financial impact of the bill over the forward estimates. These last-minute changes give an air of chaos and, by their very nature, limit time for consideration. I am the last speaker on this bill, and many have spoken over the last two sitting weeks. To rush through these changes at the end, without giving people a chance to digest them, analyse them and see what the impact is on the budget, is poor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to make significant amendments to the Banking Act 1959, the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008, the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001. The bill makes various cut-and-paste amendments to existing acts that give effect to the unclaimed moneys measures announced in the 2012-13 MYEFO. These amendments will impact arrangements relating to the transfer of unclaimed moneys to ASIC for bank accounts and life insurance policies, lost member accounts to the ATO for the superannuation, and unclaimed moneys for company moneys. This bill will bring forward the time at which money is recognised under the relevant law as lost or unclaimed, leaving Australians everywhere vulnerable to this government's greedy reach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill affects many financial institutions and many different kinds of assets held by Australians. Schedule 1 of this bill amends section 69 of the Banking Act 1959 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by Australian deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs. These changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an ADI is treated as unclaimed moneys from seven years to a period of only three years. If this bill passes, money held in ADIs will be deemed as unclaimed if a transaction has not occurred in the account for that period of time. This excludes payment of interest accrued. This change has mammoth potential widespread consequences for many Australians. For instance, say an Australian worker who has been offered a post overseas for the next four years decides to leave a sizeable amount of money in a high-interest bank account to accumulate interest. This person, who for whatever reason has chosen not to make any further deposits or withdrawals for that period of time, will, under this bill, have their deposit treated as unclaimed moneys. These funds will be moved to the government's own account, known as the consolidated revenue fund, and used to pad out the bottom line of that financial year's budget. In the Senate report a number of concerns were raised, which were shared by coalition senators, about the reduction by four years in the inactivity test period. The senators concluded that the three-year inactivity test for bank accounts is too short and needs to be reviewed to consider whether five years would be a more appropriate duration. Accounts which might be affected include those of Australians being posted overseas and accounts owned by children or set up for children's savings but without a contribution during the three years. In the case of a first home saver account, hard times can mean that contributions are not made for at least three years. Can you imagine the number of people that might be affected by an arbitrary three-year test? I imagine that is why the government is so keen to act this financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition dissenting report also pointed out that many account types should be excluded. A submission from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A high level analysis by CBA indicates that the majority of account balances at CBA which would be impacted by the proposed changes to unclaimed monies currently receive an interest rate higher than the CPI linked rate which the Bill proposes to be paid on those balances once transferred to unclaimed monies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, a three-year requirement would be detrimental to a large number of Australians. Another recommendation from the coalition Senate report was that inactivity should be tested at the account holder level. If an inactive account is held by a consumer with one or more accounts at the bank, strongly suggesting that the customer is still alive and engaged with the bank, then the balance of the inactive account should not be deemed unclaimed and transferred to consolidated revenue. As such, where a customer holds multiple accounts with the bank, the inactivity test should be elevated to the level of the customer to help avoid unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also plans to appropriate funds from first home saver accounts by amending the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed monies held by the first home saver account providers. This is outlined in schedule 2. Once again, the bill before the parliament today would amend section 17A and 51C of the FHSA Act to change unclaimed monies for the period from seven years to three years as with the changes to the ADIs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government announced the introduction of first home saver accounts in its own 2008-09 budget to assist parents in saving for their children's future. Many parents have established these accounts for their children but may not have been able to make contributions recently for a variety of factors, be it the ever rising cost of living that this government does not acknowledge or a temporary lack of disposable income. Some of these accounts have a very real risk of being claimed by the government, particularly when holders of these accounts have not been able to afford to contribute to their deposits over the past three years or have not been in contact with the bank which holds these deposits. The coalition considers that this four-year reduction also increases, unreasonably, the risks of unintended consequences and we suggest that this bill be delayed a year to allow sufficient time for consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Life Insurance Act 1995 as per schedule 3 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed life insurance monies. Life insurance companies are required to report on and pay unclaimed monies to the Commonwealth. Unclaimed monies include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of the policy. The new arrangements outlined in this bill will reduce the period before life insurance monies are treated as unclaimed from seven to three years. It is, again, not clear how these provisions will apply to contemporary life insurance products or policies, and this confusion has arisen because the government has not had time to properly develop the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 to the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to change the circumstances in which small lost member accounts and accounts of unidentifiable members must be transferred to the ATO to provide for the payment of CPI interest on unclaimed superannuation money. Again, the coalition recommends that the proposed amendments in schedule 4 of the bill be delayed for a full year to 31 December 2013 to address the critical issues raised since the announcement of this measure. Lost superannuation accounts with balances of less than $2,000 that have up until now been inactive for only three years—currently this is set at seven years—and accounts of identifiable members that have been inactive for 12 months will now be required to be paid to Australian Taxation Office. It is not clear how legislative change will apply to people who have moved jobs and have multiple superannuation accounts, spent time overseas or moved residences. The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees noted in its submission that the problem of transferring such active accounts to consolidated revenue was that it was most likely to impact new employees, young people and low-income earners as these contributing members typically take the most time to accumulate account balance over $2,000. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to amend longstanding pillars of our financial services industry. Changes to these acts must never be made lightly, and the coalition will not facilitate a government that is acting out of self-interest as opposed to properly considered public policy. The coalition has advocated for a wide range of review measures to ensure that this bill has had due assessment to ensure that there were no unintended consequences. This is a bill that this government has concocted out of desperation to save its crumbling budget bottom line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition senators reached three recommendations, which include various parts of the schedules 1, 2 and 4, and the amendments to be moved by the shadow Treasurer this afternoon will reflect this. I urge the government to support them for the benefit of both consumers and industry who have been caught unawares by this rushed legislation. One of the other unintended consequences is for people who develop dementia. What will be done with their accounts? Will the government take money from people who are getting ill? Is that right? You have said they will keep their money; will they?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BALDWIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I stand today to speak to the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. From the outset, let me say that I have real concerns with the speed at which this bill has been brought to this House. I understand from the government's perspective why it needs to introduce this bill, which will bring $700 million into consolidated revenue and some $886 million into consolidated revenue over the forward estimates. This consolidated revenue benefit is designed to do nothing more than prop up the budget in an attempt to produce a surplus to make the government look good. This is not earnings by government. This is taking the money which individuals or corporations own and that is in bank accounts, life insurance and superannuation policies that actually belong to someone. Your excuse is that this money does not belong to someone, so therefore it belongs to the government, and therefore the government can use it to prop up its ineptitude in managing a budget. I have real concerns with the speed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These concerns have been expressed in dissenting reports put down in the Senate. In particular, one of the things that really concerns me is in relation to superannuation, and the fact that the government will deem an account lost or inactive if there has been no action within 12 months. There are a large number of people, particularly young Australians who, when they leave school and start work might have a multitude of jobs; might amass a lot of small amounts of superannuation which they have not consolidated into one account. They might go travelling or they might go overseas for 12 months as a rite of passage as they explore offshore opportunities. Indeed, they might even go bush for 12 months and jackaroo or work up in Cairns in the tourism industry and be deemed non-contactable. Therefore, their hard earned money will go into consolidated revenue for this government. It is true that when it is claimed back they will be able to get an interest supplement from the government at the lowest rate.</span>

                    </a>  Well, Parliamentary Secretary, let's be honest about it: this is about a cash grab to line up the bottom line of your budget and nothing more. That is why it is being done with this speed. And those young children sitting up in the gallery watching you would say, 'What are you doing to my future earning capacity when you have designed a scheme that now, within 12 months of deemed inactivity, by criteria set down by you and your colleagues that will take that money away?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have real concerns, and I believe that this bill before the House is going to be supported by Independents because there was a deal done. And that deal is the poker machines legislation which will be brought into this House tonight, which the government previously said would not work—in fact, Minister Macklin said on a number of occasions that the voluntary precommitment would not work. But, such is the demand from perhaps the member for Denison that he wants his bill through, and the government needs his support on this bill to get it through to prop up the bottom line. This government is selling out the hotel and the club industries for the purposes of getting this bill through. I will have more to say on that tonight, when I speak to the gambling reforms legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say that I feel very uncomfortable with this bill. I am glad that the shadow Treasurer will be moving a number of regulatory changes to make sure that it conforms more with sound, sensible responses—particularly at the time in which this will all come together. But I want to say I feel uncomfortable, because it is clear that this bill does nothing more than raid the bank accounts and superannuation funds of people to prop up the government's bottom line. Be honest about it.</span>

                    </a>  I'm not making it up, Parliamentary Secretary. Here you are, with your forward estimates, your schedules to the bill—schedules 1, 2 and 3: banking, first home saver account, life insurance this year will deliver you $93.4 million as you raid it off people; schedule 4: superannuation, $513.5 million; schedule 5: companies and corporations, $94 million; $700 million to your bottom line. So it is not true revenue, it is not income, it is not money the government has earned—it is money you are taking out of the accounts of everyday Australians to prop up your financial position to make you look like you could be somewhat of a responsible financially accurate government. You are not: you are robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it is not your money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to speak any further on this bill. I will be opposing it. I think it is wrong. I think the delivery method is wrong. I think the speed and access are wrong. And in particular I feel that the fact that this bill has brought other bills into action because of deals and swaps and a need for votes is going to do immeasurable harm to Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr JENSEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  With the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012 the government yet again travels down a well-worn path, with another blatant cash grab of Australians' hard-earned income. I have no hesitation in opposing this bill, because of the haste with which this government has chosen to introduce this legislation. Gone is sufficient time to assess the impact and unintended consequences, replaced with a desperate dash to the next budget—framed by creative accounting towards a non-paper surplus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the people of Tangney and all other Australians are left disregarded by a shambles of naive legislation and ignorant policy. Reforms to the Banking Act 1969 make new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held in deposit-taking institutions. The coalition had sought to refer the bill to the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for prudent and measured assessment. Why this government has not sent this bill to the parliamentary inquiry lends itself to the question: what are the members of this Labor government seeking to achieve? And do they fully understand the potential implications for Australians? Instead, this bill has been rushed to the House for debate because Labor sees opportunity to profit from those who can least afford it. We are three days from this place rising for 2012. It is quite apparent the government is bent on rushing this and a swathe of other bills to a vote to temper current debt of $252.9 billion. In addition to the Banking Act 1969, this bill also seeks to amend unclaimed money measures which were flagged in the government's 2012-13 MYEFO, to the First Home Savers Account Act 2008, the Life Insurance Act 1985, the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001—the focus: arrangements relating to the transfer of unclaimed moneys to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for bank accounts and life insurance policies, lost members' accounts at the Australian Taxation Office for superannuation, and unclaimed moneys for companies' moneys.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similar to most of the economic policies of the current Treasurer, this legislation will bring forward to 2012-13 a significant sum of money that the legislation will recognise as unclaimed, lost or abandoned. This figure is forecast to be $762 million. To do this, changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an Australian deposit-taking institution is treated as unclaimed moneys from seven years to three.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear. If a worker who has money sitting in a bank account accumulating interest and does not make any further deposits or withdrawals for that period of time, at the three-year mark they will have their deposit treated as unclaimed moneys. These funds will then be moved to consolidated revenue. It is towards Orwellian that government would come in and just pluck money from a private account because it has not been active for three years. This is the reverse Robin Hood. It means that 'small' Australians—not the big end of town but the small end of town that Labor purports to support—will be robbed by the biggest institution in the land, the Australian government. This is from the Labor Party, which prides itself on fighting for the little guy. Some fight!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can an Australian government head down this path—to tap into private funds just because Australians rightly chose to leave money in a particular account? This is not the type of government I want. This is not the type of government the people of Tangney want—and they are telling me just that. Should this bill pass this place, I imagine many people, young and old, will step back 50 years and stuff their money under the mattress—better having it stagnant and not interest bearing than losing the money all together. This policy is archaic, deceptive and impractical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill amends the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008—an amendment to a bill introduced by this government relatively recently to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by the first home saver account providers. Amendments change, once again, the unclaimed moneys period from seven years to three years. Again, this schedule makes us question Labor's due diligence when introducing legislation it has drafted, with amendments after just a few years because the government has seen fiscal opportunity and seen fit to amend legislation for government gain at the cost of the individual citizen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely there is a better way to balance the budget—even after this government has produced four of the biggest budget deficits in Australia's history. Prudent, fiscally responsible and competent government should always strive for higher productivity and higher standards of living for all Australians. Pinching $2,000 here and $3,000 there, while unjust, is also bureaucratically implausible. The cost of administering this poorly developed policy surely outweighs the net gain to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I go to schedule 3, concerning life insurance. Currently life insurance companies are required to report on and pay unclaimed moneys to the Commonwealth. Unclaimed moneys include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of that policy. The new arrangements will reduce the period before life insurance moneys are treated as unclaimed moneys from seven to—you guessed it—three years. Once again, we see a reduction in the time frame, and it will allow the government to step in and take that money. If someone legitimately choses to have a bank account and leave money in there for more than three years, and not wish to add to it and not wish to subtract from it, surely they have the right to do that and not be worried that a government is going to step in and appropriate the money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act. Lost super accounts with balances of less than $2,000 that have until now been active for only three years—currently this is seven—and accounts of unidentifiable members that have been inactive for 12 months are now to be paid to the Australian Taxation Office. Note the figure of less than $2,000. Once again, we are not talking about the big end of town. Schedule 5 deals with the Corporations Act. Once again, the government seeks to move the goalposts so it is easier to get hold of private citizens' money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill just beggars belief. It changes the pillars of our financial services industry. It is clear that the rushed time lines and implementation of this bill have been driven by nothing more than a Treasurer pretending that he can deliver a surplus, a surplus that is at risk without the passing of this bill. The coalition and I will not support or facilitate a government that acts on political interest with disregard for properly considered public policy. Good government is the goal of all members in this place, Labor and Liberal, and it saddens me that the Labor Party have sold what was left of their dignity to manufacture a superficial surplus.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition's team have left this government naked. The bill exposes the wanton greed and lust for power endemic in tired and troubled Labor. This bill generates $762 million, which is a very convenient sum when the surplus is expected to be a wafer thin $1.077 billion. There is no way around it. The Treasurer is robbing not only Peter but also Paul. The only people getting paid are Labor cronies in unions and backroom boys. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final analysis, it is difficult to understand not the bill itself but where it is coming from, who is driving it. Is it the Australian Bankers Association? No, because they remain sceptical of its necessity and of the transitional administrative arrangements. Is it the lobby groups and/or academic groups? No, because they point to the lack of any evidence to suggest that three years is the optimal time to take a person's money. The job of a government should be to safeguard and protect the properties of people, not to meander into their bank accounts and confiscate their hard earned treasure. This bill goes to prove the point that the Leader of the Opposition and I have made, time and time again: a government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take everything you have.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="83E" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RIPOLL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  I thank all members who have spoken and contributed to this debate. I can understand that there is some confusion, although I find it difficult to understand why that is the case. We have clearly articulated exactly what this bill does—and the amendments to this bill—in protecting people's savings and superannuation, protecting their money and, for the first time, ensuring that people's lost accounts are not eroded away by fees and charges, and that for the first time they also have an opportunity to continue to earn interest. These are good for consumers and good for the country. The bill is certainly not what has been described by a number of members opposite. In fact, it is the case that the rules on how unclaimed moneys are dealt with, with ASIC and the ATO, are in currently place. They currently exist. In that effect there are no changes. The changes are to when it takes place. It will happen more quickly, but that is a really good thing for consumers because the earlier it happens the earlier their lost accounts can be reconnected and the quicker they can re-access their funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting part about the different elements that have been raised is that the reason the accounts are lost in the first place is people have for whatever reason become disconnected and they have no mechanism to reconnect with their lost account in whatever form. No method exists. If it is with the bank it is not in the bank's interests to put forward that you reconnect with your funds and take them out, but it is in the government's interest that ordinary people are reconnected with their funds, that the fees and charges stop being taken out and eroding a person's savings, and that savings are added to by giving people CPI interest—yes, at the lowest rate, but interest so that the value of their money maintains value over time. These are really good, sensible changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am prepared to have debates and arguments over time frames—whether it is seven years or three or whatever other time frame—but that does not change the principle. The principle we have before us is that we are trying to save people's money by giving them interest for the first time, to stop the erosion of the value of their money by having fees and charges taken out for the first time, and to make sure that the government, through the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, actively reconnects people with their money. Right now, what happens in the absence of these very good changes we are putting forward is that those unclaimed moneys go on for not three years or seven years but 10 or 15 years because people do not know. The reason they are unclaimed is a lot of people do not know they exist, or they are overseas, or whatever the case may be. The faster we can reconnect people the better it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a whole range of other issues that have been raised by opposition members trying to confuse this area—that the government is somehow reaching into people's accounts. That is not the case at all. This is an amendment to existing laws about things that currently happen, and this is an improvement to what we have seen in the past. This bill is directly intended to do exactly what it does, which is re-unite Australians with their lost moneys faster and to protect that lost money from inflation and fees. I am astonished that anyone in this place would oppose it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made a number of technical amendments and we have clarified a range of areas—because there are a lot of technical issues in some of these matters—and this now means it is clear for banks and for consumers. We have given the appropriate time frames for organisations to be able to implement these new measures. Contrary to the suggestions from the opposition, this bill does not introduce a new regime for lost moneys. Rather, the bill will deliver better outcomes for consumers by making a small number of refinements to the existing regime. This is the disingenuous element of some of what has been said in this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are laws that existed under the Howard government. What we have done and what we continue to do in government is take those laws and make them better. Following consultation with the industry the government will move amendments to the bill that will provide industry with more time to implement the changes. There is no argument from industry about whether this is right or wrong, because it is currently being done. We are giving industry a little bit more time to be able to properly—</span>

                    </a>  We get laughter from the opposition. More time—isn't that what they were saying? Isn't that what they wanted? That is exactly what we have done—we have given them a little bit more time. It will happen in good time because the faster these changes happen the better it is for consumers. If we used the principle that the opposition brings to the table there would be no time, because they could never find the time in 12 years in government—there was never any time. There was never any time to make any good changes. We will take the time and we will do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, we have also authorised for deposit-taking institutions, First Home Saver Account providers and life insurers to be required to make supplementary assessment and transfer by 31 May 2013. That is sufficient time for the changes to be adopted, adapted and implemented so that people can be earlier reconnected with their money. This provides an extra five months for these institutions to identify lost accounts and an extra two months to transfer them, as requested by industry groups such as Abacus. We agree with them. Let us give them a little bit more time. Let us make these changes. But the faster we get there the quicker people will be reconnected. All the evidence is on the table. All you have to do is go through the evidence from history. Have a look at what happened with unclaimed moneys in each previous year. There were more and more of them over time and no effort was made—nothing was done—to reconnect people. As soon as this Labor government started to make an effort, we saw a change. We saw people who had lost accounts being reconnected with their accounts. We are seeing people with lost super being reconnected with their super. We are seeing the things that this bill intends to do working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had more evidence recently. There has been a bit of media activity around this issue, including on the radio. The government and ASIC have promoted the fact that people ought to go and use the free search tool at ASIC or the ATO to look for their lost accounts. A whole drift of people have gone there to reconnect for the first time. This bill will assist people to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the key that the opposition needs to understand. Most people have no way of knowing that they have lost money. Even if you thought you had, where would you look? It is lost. Where would you start? But as soon as it transfers from the institution—the bank or wherever it might be—to ASIC or the ATO you can search for it. It does not matter how long you wait. You can search it now or you can search it in 10 years and your money will still be there. It will not have been eroded by fees and charges. The real value of your money will have been maintained because you will get interest. For the first time, you will get interest. How could you oppose that? In 10 years time, somebody who lost their money will be able to reconnect with their funds. Under this mob's rule, what happened was that it just stayed lost. That is what they want: they want the money to stay lost. They want the lost accounts to stay lost. They want to make an amendment all right: one to take the time period from the old seven years to forever, because they are not interested in reconnecting people with their funds. We are and that is exactly what we are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consultation with industry has identified some areas in which the intent of the amendments can be clarified. These issues can and will be dealt with through regulations, as per my press release yesterday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will ensure that more Australians are reunited with their lost moneys. They will also ensure that this happens faster. That is the whole point. Why wait any longer? If somebody has a lost account—lost moneys in either their life insurance policy, superannuation, bank accounts or even property—why should they have to wait any further? Let us reconnect people with their money and let us do it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a range of issues raised by speakers on the other side. I will make a few points to clarify things. The principles in the existing legislation will not be changed. The principles remain exactly the same. At some point in time, be it seven years or three years, that money will be transferred—and this was done during the Howard era—from an account that is lost, unidentifiable or inactive to the ATO or to ASIC. What we are doing is making that happen faster so that you can reconnect with your funds faster. The principles have not changed. When those opposite say that the government is taking your money, that is not the case, because that is the existing law—it is exactly what happens now; it is exactly what happened during the Howard era. We did not hear them at that point in time saying that they were taking that money. The key principle differences are that it stops your money being eroded through fees and charges for the first time and that you get interest for the first time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other concern from the opposition revolves around speed: it is all too fast, according to them. We may be moving too quickly for the opposition, but we can walk, chew gum and breathe at the same time and introduce good amendments. This is not too fast. This is appropriate. It is about time that people are reconnected with their funds in a more timely manner. Whether that lost money is in superannuation, life insurance policies or bank accounts, the settings that we are putting in place are appropriate—and particularly for super. There is a complexity to super, particularly for young people with multiple accounts. In fact, superannuation is one of the areas in which there is an enormous amount of lost money. The shorter the time period, the quicker it moves across, the faster that you will be able to identify and reconnect with your superannuation. That is great for consumers. It means that they can get their money faster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues that have been raised have been more than amply dealt with. The amendments that we have put forward, after good consultation with the industry about implementation periods, are sensible and appropriate. The government commends this bill to the House, because it is good for consumers and good for reconnecting people with their lost moneys.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is moving an amendment to delay the start date of schedules 1, 2 and 4 of this bill, which deal with changes to bank accounts, first home saver accounts and unclaimed superannuation. Under schedule 1, the coalition is seeking to delay the implementation date of the changes, which reduce the period before an amount payable by an Australian deposit-taking institution or money held in a bank account is treated as unclaimed money from seven years to three years. As the Senate inquiry found:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Submissions from the Australian Bankers' Association (ABA), the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and the Association of Financial Advisers (AFA) suggested three years was too short a period of inactivity to deem an account unclaimed, particularly given the growing number and type of accounts that customers intentionally leave inactive for extended periods.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions from institutions provided to the committee also challenged the government’s claim that owners of inactive accounts would be better off once the money in those accounts was transferred, with examples provided of many accounts where interest paid on those accounts was currently higher than CPI or inflation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this measure, the coalition thinks that it is particularly disturbing that information provided by Treasury confirmed that they were unable to quantify the number of affected accounts. Treasury did not even know how many accounts were going to be affected but mentioned that approximately 14,000 accounts were transferred to ASIC last financial year. When questioned whether inactive accounts of active customers—for example, customers with other active accounts would be excluded—Treasury simply stated that the definition of unclaimed moneys had not changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the test for unclaimed moneys within the legislation before the House is whether or not a transaction has occurred on that account, not whether or not you have other active accounts within one institution. When the coalition pressed Treasury around current statistics for bank accounts that will be impacted by this legislation, they were only able to refer to current data under the current seven-year time limit. Of the accounts listed in ASIC's database that were transferred in the 2012 financial year, half had a balance below $1,275 and the mean account balance was approximately $4,400. Perhaps the most disturbing feature was the current largest unclaimed bank account listed in the ASIC database was for $992,750 in Carlisle, in Western Australia. If this is what is going on on ASIC's register after seven years, then how many people are going to be affected after three years? The government does not know. The coalition deems this to be an unsatisfactory policy motivation. The coalition will also move an amendment to delay the implementation date of schedule 2 to this bill, which deals with the changes to first home saver accounts, for similar reasons to that which I have outlined for the delay of schedule 1. Our amendments will also delay the start date of schedule 4 of this bill which amends unclaimed moneys in superannuation. This delay will provide a more timely introduction for the government, given the autoconsolidation changes that are due to commence on 1 January 2014.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, we are giving everyone time to properly consider this legislation and to properly implement it. The policy intent might be there, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer is right to say we had similar in principle unclaimed policy proposals under our government. But this government is just doing a fix to try and get the budget to surplus this year. That is all it is about, and quite frankly we are not going to cop it because we will not support legislation that is fundamentally flawed and adds to the red tape burden of everyone on an everyday basis.</span>

Therefore you declared the vote in our favour. I would ask you to refer the matter to the Speaker for checking the tapes, because I think you acted entirely properly. There were no declared noes against the amendment; therefore, the matter is passed.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. In consideration of this measure, it is worth noting that five years ago the Labor government was elected; there were four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat, and that figure today is well over 12,000, whether they are on bridging visas, in community detention, in alternative places of detention or in the detention network itself. From just four people to over 12,000 in the last five years is a record of failure that has no peer. It is a record of failure that this government will never be able to erase, either by correcting it, because of their own incompetence and lack of resolve on this issue and the inadequacy of their policy responses, or by removing it from the memory of the Australian people, who will always mark this government as the worst performing government on our borders in our nation's history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of this bill is to expand the existing offshore processing regime to apply to all persons arriving on mainland Australia unlawfully by sea. It will replace the concept of 'offshore entry persons' with the concept of 'unauthorised maritime arrivals'—some semantics from the government; changing words does not change their failures. It will mean that even persons who arrive on Australian soil, on the mainland, by boat will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and will be processed according to that regime. This bill will effectively excise the Australian mainland from the Migration Act, and the government say it is intended to act as a disincentive to people to make the journey to Australia. The government have been more in the business of providing incentives, not disincentives, for people to come by boat, and the record demonstrates that with arrivals now averaging over 2,000 per month, and that continues. Even this month, there have been well over 2,000 before the month has even concluded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the government's decision to allow all offshore entry persons access to merits and judicial review through the Refugee Review Tribunal, which occurred in the courts in March this year, the purported impact of this measure has been substantively, if not completely, negated. The decision to treat those who come by boat in the same way as those who come by a legal method to Australia has effectively removed one of the key issues and key parts of the border protection regime that was put in place by the Howard government to ensure a distinction between the way these matters were handled and, in particular, their access to the courts. This government has hard wired the claims of people who have come illegally by boat to our court system. So it does not matter if you get a 'No'; you can just keep appealing this endlessly, you can keep appealing this through the courts, and you can be here for many years when you have no viable claim. You can just keep going through the courts on and on, and the government's decision to do that in March effectively removed the import of the measure which is before us today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistency is very important in politics. It is important in policy. It is important in terms of the resolve you demonstrate when handling matters. On this side of the House there has been nothing but consistency on this issue. It is the stock-in-trade of the coalition when it comes to border protection that people know what we stand for, that they know what we believe in, that they know what we will do, that they have a measure of certainty about the actions that we will take. That measure of certainty is not held just by the Australian people but, even more significantly, it is held in the minds of the people smugglers themselves. They know where we stand on this issue and they know that if there is a change of government at the next election the game is up. There will be new management when it comes to these issues: a management that does not fold every time smugglers lean on them, a management that does not hand out protection visas to people who burn down detention centres or set boats alight. That is not the sort of management that they will see from a coalition if we are elected. They will see a coalition that will act consistent with our principles and consistent with the policies that we have advocated, implemented and defended for over a decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place we will support the government's bill in not opposing this measure. It is, by the minister's own admission, very much the bill that was introduced to this House by the Howard government in 2006, and which passed this place—in the House of Representatives. So we will once again not oppose a measure such as this. Indeed, we will support it. I suspect that, within this place, the members on our side of the House will vote as they did last time. They will vote consistent with how they voted last time, and I suspect even those members on our side who have had long reservations about this matter will act consistently with the way they have acted previously. That is something we respect in the Liberal Party. Where people particularly have longstanding positions on these matters then they are not bound by the factional ball and chain that you see on the other side of the House, where dissent is put down and where people's ability to express their deeply held convictions and views in this place is not suppressed as it is on the other side of a House. I suspect there are some on our side who will act consistent with the way they have always acted, and the interesting thing about that is that they did it when they were in government, in the face of a government that they were part of, and they will do it in the face of a government today that they are not a part of. I respect that decision on their part. It is not the view on this bill of coalition more broadly, or the position that the coalition more broadly will take, but it is consistent. Everyone on this side of the House will vote, I believe, consistently with the way they voted last time when these matters were considered by this House. The same bill as the one before us today, when it was introduced in 2006 by the Howard government, was met in this place by raging debate. It was said by Labor members then in opposition—and indeed by the now minister for immigration himself—that the bill was a 'stain on our national character' and that it that it offended 'decency'. A former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, said that it was 'shameful' and 'xenophobic'. Another current minister, Minister Ellis, said that it was 'lunacy', 'indecent', 'inhumane' and 'gutless'. Those same individuals—with the exception of the minister, who has already spoken when introducing this bill—are not on the speakers list for this bill; you will not find them there. But they will vote today to support the bill that they have brought to this place of their own volition. It is their policy. The government cannot hide behind panels or committees or anything of that nature. Once a minister of the government brings a bill into this place, puts it on this table and introduces it, they own it. It is their policy. It is meant to represent what they believe: their convictions. You on that side of the House cannot hide behind Angus Houston when you have to vote on this bill today. If you vote for this bill today, you are admitting that you were hypocrites and frauds in 2006, and the Australian people will see it just that way. On this side of the House we will act consistently with our beliefs, our long-held views, our convictions and our policy on unlawful arrivals. We will not oppose the bill before the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, as I said, will expand offshore processing to apply to all people who arrive on the Australian mainland unlawfully by sea, effectively excising the Australian mainland from the Migration Act. I return to some of the things that were said in the debate in 2006, because what this bill is really all about—and the bill will pass this House—is this government's record of inconsistency and hypocrisy. The now Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said on 10 August 2006:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill. If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Amending this bill is like putting lipstick on a pig. You can put all the lipstick you like on it but it will still be a pig. You can amend this bill all you like but it will still be a bad bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How shameless it is of this minister to now bring the same bill into this place. It seems that the minister is now using as an excision bill what he described as a pig of a bill in 2006 in order to try to save his own political bacon. That is what is happening in this place. The government have focused on the politics of illegal arrivals for five years—do not solve the problem; solve the politics—and that is exactly the same thing I witnessed in the New South Wales state Labor government for 16 years. Under the faceless men of the Labor Party in Sussex Street, the New South Wales state government ran the state into the ground, and the same method is at work and alive here in this place. It is at work in the pungent hypocrisy of the government's bringing this bill, which they say they now believe in, into this place. Mr Bowen said that the bill in 2006 had no redeeming features. But this government have no redeeming features.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stench of hypocrisy will rise from those opposite—every single last one of them—as they walk into this House and vote for this bill. Mr Bowen said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We will oppose this bill, and I call on members opposite to join us. If it is passed, it will be repealed by an incoming Labor government. Decency and self-respect as a nation would demand nothing less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But they did not repeal it; they have introduced the same bill again. Is there anything higher in the flip-flop scale than that? Today, the minister stands to introduce the very same legislation he condemned in 2006 and promised to repeal. But he was not alone in his sanctimony. On 9 August 2006, the member for Watson, the current Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and a former shadow minister for immigration, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is better than this bill. The legislation before us today undermines our sovereignty, is offensive to our decency and makes a mockery of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is better than this government. Australia is better than the hypocrisy of this government and its incompetent failures. Australians demand a better government. They demand a government which knows what it believes in and they want to know what their government believes in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Watson said that it was 'offensive to our decency and makes a mockery of the parliament.' No, it is this government which is an offence to decency. It is this government which makes a mockery of itself. He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We do not know whether to laugh at just how ludicrous this legislation is or cry at the very real impact and real pain it seeks to cause some of the most desperate people in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you read these words from the then shadow minister, now the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, you learn that the expression 'crocodile tears' has a new meaning. He continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor is going to oppose this bill in every way, and we will oppose it at every stage … The bill before us is wrong—it is just plain wrong. Labor will not have anything to do with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But you own it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next we have the member for Hotham, a former Leader of the Opposition and now the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts. He spoke on 10 August 2006 during a debate which went for several days—a debate they were then all very keen to participate in, although they do not seem too keen today. The list of speakers from the government is pretty slim today. No-one on that side wants to stand up for this bill, although they will vote for it. During that debate, the member for Hotham said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor opposes it outright. There is nothing you can do to this excision bill that will fix it. We do not seek to amend it; we will oppose it in its entirety. The bill is shameful and xenophobic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an old tactic, an old accusation from Labor—when you cannot meet the argument, call the coalition racists. When your policies do not stack up and your failures are so profound that you cannot speak over the noise of your own failures, when you cannot make an argument and you cannot get anything right, just call coalition members racists—as Labor members have been doing for the past week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those members opposite, particularly those representing Western Sydney, know that every time a Labor member calls the coalition and coalition members who are standing up for stronger border protection and who believe in stronger border protection racists, they are calling those who share those views racists. They are calling their own constituents racists. As I move around Western Sydney, it is clear that this issue and the government's failures have brought the people of that area to a point of absolute frustration. They are not racists; they are just sick of government incompetence. They are sick of a government which cannot protect our borders and cannot do one of the most fundamental things a national government is elected to do. The government can call them racists if they like, but at the next election they will reap what they sow in making those claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hotham went on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a foolish nonsense. It is worse than that though. It is a vindictive and vicious measure to take against unfortunate and desperate people. It does nothing to secure our borders and returns to the government’s old policy of deterrence and punishment based on fear. It is a bill that should be opposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am always interested when the government talks about compassion in relation to this matter. There is not a decision you make in this area of asylum policy which does not have serious consequences for human beings. Every decision you make has that impact and everybody who participates in this debate should understand that. I certainly do. But you have to take ownership of your decisions and the consequences which flow from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, when they were ranting and raving at this bill and subjecting the now Father of the House, the member for Berowra; the then Prime Minister, John Howard; and others to their abuse and vitriol, were saying, 'We have a better way of dealing with this.' At the 2007 election, five years ago, they got their way and all of those who supported them got their way. They got what they asked for. They got the Howard government measures abolished. All of those measures went. And what happened? Over 30,000 people turned up; over 1,000 people were dead in the water; over 8,000 people were denied protection visas in this country from some of the most desperate places in the world because they did not come on a boat; and there was a cost blow-out of $6.6 billion and counting this year alone—including capital it will cost $2.7 billion. These are the consequences. It does not sound to me like a particularly compassionate outcome. It sounds to me like an absolute disaster in humanitarian and financial terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one thing to sound compassionate; it is another thing to be compassionate and to have policies that deal with the problem. People ask on various programs, whether on the ABC or other places, 'Why are we even talking about this?' Because the government has failed, that is why. When you fix the problem you do not have to talk about the problem, but this government ignored the problem and just wanted to change the debate. As the previous Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Chris Evans said, his greatest failing was that he was not able to control the conversation enough. No! The problem was that he was not able to control the borders. The fact that the government does not get that this is the issue it has to solve, and that the consequences of not fixing it are disastrous for human beings and the taxpayers of Australia alike, is something I will never understand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vitriol continues. The member for Adelaide, now the Minister for Early Childhood and Child Care and for Employment Participation, said on 9 August 2006:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now every member of this House has a stark choice: do they stand up and vote against a proposal which has the wrong motivations, which is indecent and inhumane by its very nature and which is clearly absurd …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Did the minister stand up in the ministry? Did she stand up in the party room, or the caucus, as it is called on that side of the House? Did she stand up on that day? Did she have a stark choice? In the course of her speech she described the measures as lunacy, ludicrous, harsh, indecent, inhumane, unfair and gutless. That is what we will see with every Labor member who walks in and votes for this bill today: gutlessness. To switch their position on such a matter, where they displayed such passion and directed such vitriol, and now they work out that it was a problem—the very first thing they should do as they walk in here is apologise to John Howard and to the member for Berowra for the abuse, the vitriol and the slurs that they put on those two great men's characters. They were compassionate men who wanted to do the right thing to ensure we had integrity of our borders and that people smugglers were not trading on people's lives. Labor should apologise to them today if they are going to vote for this bill, and if they do not they are gutless—gutless to their core.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister concluded by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am clear that I will continue to absolutely oppose this legislation and I encourage all members to do likewise.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the thing with the Labor Party: it always believes what it believes until the day it does not, and the Australian people know that. The government announces something and it never happens: 'But we announced it.' Then why did it not happen? 'We did not get around to it, we changed our minds, we did not go ahead with it.' Those opposite are big on the announcements. They are big on the big symbols. They are big on the big Herculean stands and the wars on goodness knows what. I remember in the first term of this government we had a war on everything, but when it comes to fighting those battles they disappear. The Australian people know they cannot trust Labor on this. You cannot trust someone who clearly does not know what they believe in in this space. This requires a resolve based on conviction, and this government simply does not have it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am no fan of the Greens' policies, no fan at all. I think they are a disaster for what they mean for these issues, but at least they believe the same thing for more than a day. I suspect that is why some people who used to vote for the Labor Party now vote for the Greens—they know that the Labor Party has lost its soul. It is run by spivs and union hacks who will do whatever it takes. We all know who said that: whatever it takes. That is the culture of what was once a great party. Now it has been reduced to this. How ashamed the great Labor men and women would be of this government and the way it has dealt with this matter. The member for Grayndler, now Leader of the House, said on 10 August: </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I wish to speak in the strongest possible terms in opposition to the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. This government has a policy that is built on sand. It shifts with the wind, it shifts on the basis of what is in the political interest of the government in terms of its preparedness to promote fear, to promote hatred and to vilify some of the most vulnerable people in the global community. It is no way for this parliament to provide the leadership that we have been entrusted to provide by our respective communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that statement he talked about a government that has a policy 'built on sand', that 'shifts with the wind', that 'shifts on the basis of what is in the political interest of the government'. He was being a prophet, but not about the Howard government; he was being a prophet about the government that he would be a part of. He was the Nostradamus speaking back in 2006 about the government he would be a part of, which is demonstrated in the hypocrisy of this bill which has been brought before this place today. He went on to say:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A government that so betrays its own values is a government that is no longer worthy of representing the people of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was from the member for Kingsford-Smith. Well, he is damned, like this government, by his own words and his own actions. Out of respect for Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, I will not refer to the comments by the member for Calwell, but I am sure the Deputy Speaker knows them well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see on that side of the House is gross hypocrisy and a recalcitrant failure to acknowledge that, when you get something wrong, you admit you got it wrong. But we have not heard that from this government. We have not heard from this government that it was wrong to abolish the Howard government policies—not once, not a peep about that. The hypocrisy and lack of grace in that is breathtaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister said when he was in opposition that it was a stain on our national character to support this bill. Well, there is a stain on the government, because of their actions on border protection, that will never wash off, no matter how hard they try. The hypocrisy and political expediency of the government in trying to save their own neck and save a failed Prime Minister is on display for the entire country to see and before this parliament. That stain will not wash off. That stain will be visible and will mark every single member of the government who comes in and votes on this bill—every single one. I hope it rests heavily on them as they come in here, and I hope it rests heavily on them when they go back to their branch members and try to explain to those who have supported them over years and years the absolute gutter hypocrisy that they have displayed in this place. This measure, as I said at the outset, is, frankly, a fairly marginal measure. I think it will have very little impact at all. In fact, I think the real reason that the government has brought this before this place is that the government knows that it cannot cope with the rate of arrivals, and this simply provides an expediency to bypass Christmas Island and bring people straight to the mainland. That is what it does. It just enables the water taxi to go to other ports in Australia—not just to go to Christmas Island, but to come directly here to the mainland. This is a government that last week admitted that it cannot stop the boats, with arrivals of over 2,000 a month. The government's answer: more places, more beds, more cost and no effective deterrence—just more excuses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this bill is about. It is a minor expediency, both logistically and politically, for a government that have so lost their way on this issue that they will never find it again. And the Australian people know that is why they cannot trust the government on this issue. They cannot trust the government because the government themselves do not believe—so why should the Australian people believe in them? Conviction matters when it comes to issues that involve such difficult decisions. It is conviction that those on this side of the House will be demonstrating when we vote on this bill today—the conviction that has been shown by individuals and right across our party. We will vote as we did last time. We will support measures, even if they are as marginal as this one is. If it improves things slightly and we think it is a good measure, we will support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those on that side of the House have a level of explaining to do that time will not permit in this debate. When I look at the speaker's list on this matter, there are only three speakers. How ashamed they must be about this business that they bring before the House today. It is a very black day for the Labor Party. It has been a very black month. It has been a black year. It has been a black five years for the people of Australia under this government. Next year they will have the opportunity to change that and to send the one message that people smugglers will understand, and that is the election of a coalition government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  In his speech on this bill, the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012, the member for Cook referred to the greatest region of the country, Western Sydney, and talked about the fact that he had been out there quite a bit. Out in my region, in RSLs and clubs, they often have hypnosis acts where the hypnotist will call people up from the crowd and hypnotise them. It is quite often the case that the hypnotist never actually applies their own arts to themselves. In the case of what the member for Cook just did, I cannot seriously think that he believes half the garbage that he passed through as some sort of parliamentary contribution today. He mentioned a couple of times that he and the coalition support the bill but then went on to provide us with a whole range of arguments that were breathtaking in their hypocrisy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistency in public life is absolutely the goal. In terms of the setting of policy, it is absolutely important. But consistency that ignores reality and is divorced from reality and circumstance is not a substitute for good policy. We are not going to have a situation where those opposite, in terms of consistency, substitute policy and thinking differently about changed circumstances for just holding the line on something that they believe worked 10 years ago, when there is nothing to substantiate whether it will actually hold true today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All those opposite have had on this issue in dealing with irregular maritime arrivals is to go back to what John Howard did. The member for Warringah has never had an idea that John Howard has not thought of first. Anything that is in his playbook right now is pretty much going back to what former Prime Minister John Howard advocated—and there is never anything really new. That is why they are stuck on this issue of consistency. It is because, when they open the policy cupboard, frankly, it is bare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How is it they can lecture about consistency when, for example, they opposed our Malaysia agreement on the basis that Malaysia was not a country that was a signatory to the refugee convention and yet, on the other hand, they pursue a policy that advocates towing boats back to Indonesia, which, funnily enough, is not a signatory to the refugee convention?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, in most recent times, they have announced a policy that would have Sri Lankan asylum seekers automatically sent back to Sri Lanka, with no processing of their claims in accordance with the refugee convention. This coalition policy announced in September has no regard for the convention. Are they sending them back to a country that is a signatory to the convention? No. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They lecture us on consistency and bring up comments in relation to consistency throughout this debate. For example, when they were seeking the support of the Greens in the House when we were dealing with the member for Lyne's resolution in relation to asylum seekers back in June, they said they would support an increase in the humanitarian intake, which is advocated in the Houston report. That report has a series of recommendations into which we have breathed life over the course of the last few months. On the one hand, the coalition say that they will support that; then last week the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, said they will not support that. And they come in here and talk about consistency, when we see a complete absence of consistency from their side. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk about suppressing dissent. During that debate on the member for Lyne's resolution, I clearly remember, as many in this House would remember, the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Julie Bishop, and another coalition member bookending the member for Moore and preventing the member for Moore from exercising his view on what should be done in relation asylum seekers. How is it that they can overlook that suppression of a view on their side and put pressure on the member for Moore and the member for Pearce—</span>

                    </a>  We have the situation, again, regarding the application of consistency, where they should be consistent in relation to the expression of alternative views on their side of the fence on this matter. What we are doing is exactly what was put forward in the Houston report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To break the deadlock in this chamber on this issue, an expert panel of eminent Australians was brought together to consider this and to put forward a range of recommendations about what should be done. We are breathing life into one of those recommendations in the bill before the House. There are people who express surprise about this move, but it is clear that if you arrive in some part of what is considered Australia then you are transferred to Manus Island or Nauru, but if you proceed to the mainland then you would be treated differently. There is no consistency in that sort of approach, and that is what this bill seeks to deal with. I have had people raise that view; I even had it on Twitter today, where people were expressing their view in relation to this matter. This is about consistency. It is about dealing with the fact that since 2008 1,500 people have put their lives at risk travelling beyond Christmas Island or Cocos (Keeling) Islands to try to get to the mainland and they have been intercepted. We need to do something about this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to ensure that we are consistent with the Houston report. That report is critical in charting a way forward as to how we proceed on this. There are things in that report that I do not agree with, frankly. I have expressed this to the minister and I have expressed it publicly, and I do not have any problem expressing it here. I do not think that Nauru and Manus Island will work in the longer term. Those opposite believe it will; I don't. The reason for that is that times have changed and policy should reflect the times in which we operate. With the greatest respect to the Houston panel and the government, in all honesty, I think the government are trying to reflect what we have said publicly—that is, that we will follow the Houston report and the recommendations. Those opposite have not necessarily committed to every single thing that we have put forward or have seen put forward through the Houston report, even though this report, comprehensive as it is, deals with difficult issues. I commend this report to anyone who has an interest in this matter and suggest they read it. They will see the consideration that has been given to dealing with those issues that are bedevilling us on this matter, such as ensuring that we do not give anyone advantage if they become an unauthorised maritime arrival—getting to this place and seeking asylum—and that people will not be placed at a disadvantage if they are trying to follow the proper process but then see someone as an unauthorised maritime arrival get here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Houston report deals with this issue in the breadth of its recommendations and the panel should be commended for that. I think we are reaching the point of wondering, as people have seen, as to whether or not Nauru and Manus Islands will be effective. As I said, I do not think this legislation will work in the way it was first intended, when it was introduced by the Howard government. If you are concerned about extended detention, work rights and ensuring that the children of people seeking asylum get education then, logically, you would support what we have advocated under the Malaysian agreement. That agreement reached with the Malaysian government provides for work rights, education and ensures that people are not detained. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do not take my word alone. I think it is time to reconsider the Malaysian agreement. I would put to the House words not of anyone from this side of the chamber but of someone from that side of the chamber. I note that it is causing great entertainment for those opposite to go back to quotes from way back when. In terms of consistency I would be happy to change my mind on public policy where it saves people's lives. If you contrast what I have said in the past to my position now, I am happy to do so. Because, quite frankly, I have my own conscience to deal with in advocating for policy that will save people's lives, as opposed to just blandly or stolidly sticking to something that will not change the circumstances in which we are in. That is why I read to the chamber this statement by the member for Wentworth in his contribution to the House: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I appeal to the Prime Minister to do this: to agree to the amendment. Let us pass the legislation so that Nauru can be reinstated. Let us do that; let us effectively reinstate not all but the bulk of the Howard government's policy. If that does not work—because you will never know until you try these policies—then the Prime Minister has a basis to come back and argue that the balance between the humanitarian part of the equation and the desire to ensure border security should be re-examined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bearing in mind the bulk of the Howard government's policy, we have reinstituted Nauru and Manus and we have seen what is happening there. In the last few days the government have announced changes in terms of detention here in Australia. This is what the member for Wentworth said back in June. He then concluded by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is something that can be achieved today. Nauru should be achieved. If it does not succeed then she—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the Prime Minister—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">has the opportunity to ask for stronger measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my heart of hearts I believe that is where we are getting to because, if you are serious about trying to totally disrupt the valued proposition being put forward by people smugglers which is, effectively, transit to Australia, some period in detention and then release, and they are using this proposition to milk money off the desperate, to profit from their desperation, then you would look at another system that would completely smash that and that is exactly what was proposed in the Malaysian agreement. That is what should be encouraged to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in the interim, we have had the parliament's singular inability to reach agreement on this matter. Why? Because, frankly, those opposite are more interested in political advantage than seeing a system brought into place in terms of Malaysia and offshore processing in a way which was even advocated by the Houston report. Those opposite will not do that. They will conveniently side with those who have a completely different view on the issue of asylum seekers and, notably, the Greens. They would seek to do that and defeat what is happening here, again, lectured on consistency by those opposite. Yet they are prepared to side with people who do not support their view of what should happen with asylum seekers in an effort to block Malaysia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they wanted to see the Malaysia agreement in place and they wanted to see us bringing down those numbers of unauthorised maritime arrivals, they would support it here and now, and they would—again, in the interests of consistency—do what we did in opposition, which is support the Prime Minister. That is what we did when Prime Minister Howard called on the then Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, to support him on a broad sweep of changes, to allow the government of the day to govern. That is what they will not do, because they put political interests above the interests that should be followed in this case in dealing with this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, despite the member for Cook arguing on a number of occasions that he was in support of what we are putting forward here and then trying to contrast positions from way back when with what is being said now, he was unable to actually outline a new idea—some new approach on this issue. That is why they are unable to do so. They will not be able to put forward a policy proposition, even though we are both being granted a blessing in the form of the Houston report, which tries to depoliticise this issue and tries to put forth very pragmatic ways forward for both sides of politics to be able to deal with this critical public policy area and ensure that ultimately we save people's lives. The Houston report is probably one of the best pieces of work in terms of trying to deal with a vexing policy issue. It is, as I said, to be commended for its breadth, and it should be seriously pursued by both sides. We are doing it. This legislation today is reflective of our position in relation to this, and it should certainly be embraced by those opposite.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWE" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMPKINS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  I say at the outset that I support this bill, the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Illegal arrivals by boat have been completely out of control since this Labor government came to power. As this government slowly creeps back closer and closer towards the Howard government's policy positions, I will support these moves. However, I remind the government that it should embrace temporary protection visas and a few other aspects of our policies—and then they will be there again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of this bill is to expand the existing offshore processing regime to apply to all persons arriving unlawfully on mainland Australia by sea—and that does sound familiar. The bill will also replace a concept of 'offshore entry person' with the concept of 'unauthorised maritime arrival'. As a result, even persons who arrive on Australian soil by boat will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and processed according to that system. The bill therefore excises the Australian mainland from the Migration Act and is intended to be a disincentive for people to make the journey to Australia. However, following on from the government's decision to allow all offshore entry persons access to merits and judicial reviews through the RRT and the courts in March 2012, the impact of this measure has weakened. This bill is almost a carbon copy of the bill passed by the House of Representatives under the Howard government in 2006, as it also expanded the offshore processing to apply to people arriving on mainland Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the coalition introduced an identical measure in 2006, its impact would have been much more significant, since it would also have denied all asylum seekers access to merits and judicial review. Whilst Labor has significantly watered down a number of previous coalition initiatives that reduce the intended impact of this bill, the principle is consistent with coalition policy and should be supported. There is, however, a special significance that this bill brings to the House, because this exact measure was one of those salient issues that so many on the other side railed against. The question is now: how did this come to pass? And oh how the mighty have fallen. The side of grand moralistic words, the side of sermon and sanctimony, have now dispensed with long-held moral positions and high principle in order to save themselves from their own failings—so clearly seen in the disaster that has weakened porous borders provided wholly by this Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is little wonder that the government speakers list consists now of just three first-term MPs. Once, they lined up en masse to speak against pretty much the same bill—in 2006, when it was introduced by the Howard government. They lined up to take what they believed to be the high moral ground, ignorantly believing that strong borders could remain without the will to take the measures required. History has shown that the measures that worked to bring the boats to almost a full stop and restore the integrity of our immigration system were dismantled by those on the other side. They took a solution and created a problem. It remains their problem and their failure in every respect, and the people of Australia know it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, this bill has only a few to speak on it on the government side. Today, in this debate, none of those who were so strident in their opposition in 2006 are coming out to recant and to say that they were wrong. Where is the courage? There is no courage on two levels. Those who spoke against the 2006 bill should come out and say that they were wrong, particularly those who spoke about this concept in such moralistic terms. Yet they are without courage. Those who spoke against this bill in the caucus will not vote against it because they are more interested in maintaining their preselection than they are in maintaining their moral position. This bill has everything to do with political survival, whether it is the survival of the government or maintaining Labor preselections. This bill is about the Labor Party's dedication to power above principle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken many times on these specific matters, and in the five years I have been in this position, I have not changed my belief that what the Howard government did worked and should be restored. Later in our speakers list, we will also hear from the members for Pearce and McMillan. I disagree with them in much of this policy area. However, they also have been consistent and have also maintained their beliefs over the years, and despite our alternative views, I respect them completely. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a contrast between those who have strong views and maintain them, and those who say they have strong views and dispense with them for political gain. Speaking of which, I know that there are some ministers that must be too conveniently busy to come and speak on this bill. I will help them out by reminding the House of their views as expressed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> in 2006. Firstly, the current minister has had a bit to say on the 2006 bill. Minister Bowen, back in 2006, said: </span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">One of the key problems with this Labor government is that it does not have any credibility when it comes to this issue. It is that lack of credibility that means when it announces new policy measures, people smugglers do not take them seriously because it has announced things in the past which it has never followed through on. The reality is that the Labor Party has introduced and tried every policy under the sun since it came into office—every policy imaginable—apart from the ones that we all know would in fact really work. </span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">We know this policy would work because the policy has worked in the past under the Howard government. The coalition has a history of implementing policies in this area that have actually done what we needed to do by stamping out people smuggling. What needs to happen is those on that side—the government side—need to acknowledge that they have bungled yet another policy, acknowledge that it is their credibility that is now the problem and implement the full suite of Howard government border protection policies that we know will do the job as they did in the past.</span>

                    </span>When the then government was faced with this issue over a decade ago, it implemented this combination of policies and it had the desired outcome. It worked to stop people-smuggling and it is the only policy that has achieved the results that we needed to achieve.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, the government speakers list is lean because there are so many who have sold out their beliefs on this issue that they cannot bear to stand and speak on this bill. After the debate has concluded, I would imagine that the House will divide, and I will look forward to seeing those who have taken such a strong position against such matters in 2006 and since stand on the 'Yes' side. I know that the government will be working hard to ensure that there are not more than five on the 'No' side, because, if just six are counted on the 'No' side of this chamber in the division, the hypocrisy of every member of the government who sold out on principle will be enshrined in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> for evermore. The Labor Party have been wrong on this issue for over a decade, and this has been proven by the record of over 30,000 people arriving here illegally by boat. I call on them to admit that their policies have been unsuccessful and that their methods in trying to tackle people-smuggling have been wrong. I also call on them to embrace every component of the Howard government measures, the only combination of policies that has actually worked to stop people-smuggling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, the government will have the opportunity to, at long last, restore temporary protection visas, which will take the appeal of permanent residencies used by people-smugglers off the table. For years, the Prime Minister and Labor have been handing a guaranteed permanent residency on a platter to those arriving on illegal boats. They have been offering a one-way visa path to permanent residency. I look forward to the coalition seeking to introduce a bill to restore TPVs and to deny people-smugglers the ability to sell permanent residency. As everyone on this side is well aware, since Labor abolished TPVs in 2008, people-smugglers have made millions of dollars using the guarantee of permanent residency under Labor's policies to sell their product to over 30,000 people who have arrived in Australia in more than 500 illegal boats. This move has contributed to a massive $6.6 billion budget blow-out in costs to Australian taxpayers, not to mention pushing immigration detention centres to full capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, we believe that 'temporary protection visa' should mean just that. People arriving on illegal boats will only be eligible to receive a temporary visa at best. The coalition TPVs will be for a period of up to three years, which will be determined at the time the visa is granted. Furthermore, all applicants will be subject to character and health requirements. Another aspect of our bill, an aspect that I have discussed numerous times in this place, is that, unlike Labor's policy, TPV holders will have no family reunion rights under any part of the immigration program and, if they decide to leave Australia at any time, they will have no right to re-enter the country. As was the case under the Howard government, TPV holders will be able to work. A coalition government will require that if they require benefits then such benefits—income support in particular—will be subject to mutual obligation requirements as a condition of the visa. A breach of their visa would be grounds for visa holders to be taken back into detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 30,000 people have arrived on illegal boats under the current government and more than 25 per cent of these have arrived since Labor announced offshore processing on Nauru. When it comes to restoring strong borders and immigration laws, Labor simply cannot be trusted to get the job done, which is why they have resorted to introducing the coalition's long-held policies. The government cannot stop the boats and they never will. While hypocrisy will be one of the unedifying epitaphs on the gravestone of the government, that does not actually help the Australian people. Every day in Cowan I am approached or contacted by constituents speaking of this issue. The themes that consistently arise are the waste of money that the Labor government have presided over, the billions of dollars in blow-outs to support those who arrive by boat and the billions spent on facilities that were not required when the boat arrivals dropped to as few as one a year. This is in contrast to yet another month in which over 2,000 have arrived illegally, and all this under the control of the Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do they come by boat? Why do so many pass through other countries in order to get a final destination of Australia? It is because the Labor government took away the temporary protection visa policy and dismantled the raft of measures that worked, thereby guaranteeing that, if the people-smugglers could get a boat to the Australian Navy, to Customs or to any point of land, it was mission accomplished—a guaranteed contract fulfilment; success. The terms of the agreement between those with money and the people-smugglers would be complete. Is it any wonder that the people-smugglers have a viable proposal to sell and that they have cashed in on the policy positions of this Labor government? As I have said before, none of this government's mismanagement is of any comfort or cause for gratitude to the people of this country or to us. The people want it fixed. And we know that every dollar wasted on this Labor government's continued failures is a dollar to be repaid after the next change of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, after stuffing things up so badly, and spending and borrowing and taxing so much, the Labor Party will still have the option of whinging about the measures to be put in place to clean up the mess that they alone have created. That is the silver lining Labor always have after creating the dark clouds over so many policy areas in this country and throughout history.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, this bill will pass because it is consistent with our long-term position and it is fundamentally the same legislation that was introduced and passed in the House of Representatives by the Howard-led government in 2006. However, more needs to be done, as we have always said. This is not enough: Nauru was not enough and offshore processing was not enough. We always said that, despite what the government might say. The Prime Minister has said in this place—in her usual mendacious manner—that we said Nauru was always going to be the solution. We never said Nauru alone was going to be the solution. What must be done now is to return to the policies that worked. I urge the government to back the coalition's bill, which is being introduced to put temporary protection visas back on the books where they belong—and then we will start to be almost back at the point where the government will have the most important tools needed to stop the boats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is not a matter of having just one or two measures, like Nauru or the reintroduction of offshore processing that the federal government several years ago; it is a matter of bringing back the tried and true, the successful policies, and only one side has the will to do that—and, after the next election, I hope we will have the opportunity to complete the task that must be done.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  The issue of migration and of refugees is one that is particularly close to my heart. I spoke in my first speech in this place about my mother's parents, a boilermaker and a teacher, who lived by the credo that if there was a spare room in the house it ought to be used by someone who needed the space. I remember as a little kid, eating at my grandparents' place and spending time speaking to migrants, some of them refugees—from Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea, Chile, Cambodia and Sri Lanka.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also told a story that still brings a lump to my throat about an art competition run as part of Refugee Week, where the first prize went to a Karen Burmese woman who had woven a traditional crimson tunic. She was missing her homeland so much that she had made a loom by taking the mattress of the wooden bed base and using the slats as a loom to weave a traditional Karen tunic. That story for me sums up the extraordinary courage and ability of Australia's refugees. It is why you will never hear me referring to refugees as 'illegals'. It is why you will never hear me using phrases like 'boatpeople'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was of course Australia's own Doc Evatt who was a key drafter of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, which says in Article 14(1): 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.' And that is why there is nothing illegal about seeking asylum from persecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we have to do in this place is to find a set of policies that will end the sheer horror of drownings at sea. There have been over 1,000 drownings of asylum-seekers at sea over recent years. What that has meant is that, on the best estimates I have seen, about four per cent of those who have tried to get to Australia by boat have drowned doing so. It is a death rate which must give pause to anyone who simply says, 'Let everyone come.' There is nothing humane about a policy that says if you can take a leaky boat and make it to the shores of Australia you get to stay here as a refugee. To me that is a fundamentally inhumane policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have got into this situation, in part, because of changes in technology. If you go back 20 years, you needed a somewhat more experienced sailor in charge of a fishing vessel to have a chance of making it from Indonesia to Christmas Island. The GPS has changed that. With a GPS device you can actually put a 15-year-old kid in charge of a fishing boat and he has a reasonable chance of making it to Christmas Island. It has meant that more people have attempted the dangerous journey and it has meant that we have seen more drownings at sea. That in turn has meant, as the member for Chifley said, that we need to rethink our policies. Like him, I see no shame in that. The greatest shame is to pursue a set of policies that are ineffective; you need to adopt policies that will stop drownings at sea. It is the old Keynes line: 'When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is those stories of drownings which have seared themselves into my consciousness. The late, great Senator Peter Cook chaired the SIEVX inquiry, an inquiry that was looking into an incident where at least 70 children drowned; at least 200 adults lost their lives. The member for Chifley, although he did not mention it in his speech, was one of those who were on the parliamentary inquiry that investigated the Christmas Island disaster, a disaster after which 30 bodies were recovered, including four juveniles and four infants. Another 20 were missing, presumed dead. There have been others. Some of the worst of those were where vessels were simply lost at sea, where everyone on those vessels perished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Chifley, I believe that the most effective way of reducing the flow of unseaworthy vessels, and the risk to those aboard them, was the Malaysia agreement. The Malaysia agreement was one which, as the Houston panel noted, was 'vitally important'. I still support that agreement. I still hope for the day that those in the opposition will support an arrangement that would provide the clearest possible message to those considering getting onto leaky boats: don't do it, because you will be returned to one of the largest asylum-seeker camps in our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'no-advantage principle', the rock on which the Houston report is grounded, is a clear principle but it is more difficult to implement through measures available to us through the use of Nauru and Manus islands and bridging visas in Australia. Far more effective would be an agreement with Malaysia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the chief arguments raised against returning refugees to Malaysia is that Malaysia is not a signatory to the refugee convention. That is an issue raised by those opposite. It is also an issue that is frequently raised with me by local Labor Party branch members. I had to smile when the member for Cowan suggested that somehow my speaking in this debate was a way of securing my preselection, because I can promise you there is deep disquiet among many of my branch members on this issue. The argument I would make to them and that I would make today to the House is that we must see the refugee convention in its historical light. We must recognise the way in which that document was drafted and we have to recognise that some of the aspects of the refugee convention are difficult. Indeed, the member for Cook himself said that the refugee convention 'no longer reflects the practical reality'. It is a document which was drafted to deal with the flow of refugees in the aftermath of World War II.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The result is that we now have three groups of countries in the world when it comes to the refugee convention. We have developed countries with the ability to patrol their borders who are happy to sign the refugee convention. We have developing nations which receive few asylum seekers—for instance, Somalia or Iran—and are willing to sign. But there is a third set of countries—such as India, Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia—who are reluctant to sign. These are countries situated close to refugee sending nations who recognise that, were they to sign up to the refugee convention, they would be obligated to take, house and resettle all of the refugees with genuine claims who came over their borders. That is simply impractical for some of these countries to do. Pakistan, as of the end of last year, had 1.7 million refugees. For these developing countries the cost of processing asylum seeker claims, let alone the cost of meeting education, health and housing obligations, would be prohibitive. The cost is what prevents them from signing the refugee convention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You do not have to take my word for it. In April 2007 the Malaysian foreign ministry's parliamentary secretary told the news outlet Malaysiakini that it would not officially recognise refugees since 'the government is of the opinion that if Malaysia becomes party to the convention, considering its strategic geographical location in the region, it would be a drawing factor for refugees to come to Malaysia'. It is for that set of reasons that the Malaysian government has not signed the refugee convention. Malaysia is a party to many international agreements. The reputation of the Malaysian government has been done a deep disservice by those on the other side of the House in the context of the asylum seeker debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It strikes me that there is little consistency in the coalition's opposition to the Malaysia agreement based on Malaysia not having signed the refugee convention. The Howard government used Nauru to process asylum seekers at a time when Nauru was not a signatory to the refugee convention. The opposition would have boats turned back to Indonesia, a country which has not signed the refugee convention. I think what is demanded of all of us in this debate is a practical approach which recognises the reality of asylum seeker flows. GPS technology means younger and younger skippers are crewing boats. We need to work with non-signatory countries. Rather than being bound to a policy which has more people drowning at sea, we need to recognise the geopolitical realities as to why the Malaysian government does not sign the refugee convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Houston report. Those recommendations include working through a managed regional system. That approach is grounded in the Bali process, of which Australia is a core part and recognises that, around the world, there are around 40 million internally displaced people and asylum seekers—nearly twice the population of Australia. It is never going to be possible for Australia to resettle all of those who would like to seek asylum in Australia. Our best contribution will come from working regionally and finding approaches which have a reasonable sharing of the burden across countries which are willing to settle refugees. That is a classic role Australia has played—a middle-power diplomacy working cooperatively with countries in our region. I commend the Prime Minister and the foreign minister for their work in the East Asia Summit and their constant advocacy of good policy in the region and cooperative policy with those around us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I last spoke in this debate I said that I hoped the refugee intake would one day be increased to 20,000. I am now pleased to be able to welcome that increase to 20,000 places, which has occurred through the Houston report. I believe that Australia can, and should be able to, settle more refugees. I am very proud of the organisations in my own electorate of Fraser who do such good work with refugees. They are committed to rolling out the welcome mat to people who have been assessed as genuine refugees, and helping them become a strong part of the Canberra community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I also acknowledge Sarah Staege, a temporary migrant to Australia, who is in the gallery today with three of her colleagues. This indicates the benefits of migration to Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  It may help the member, who is just about to leave, to hear some of this. I have been the subject of a great deal of comment for having some very strong views about the integrity of our border arrangements and on the need for government to be assiduous in dealing with those issues. But often people do not understand the reasons I have that strength of view on those matters. They arise because for most of my time in public life—and, as many know, I have been in this chamber as a member of the House of Representatives for 39 years—I have taken a great deal of personal interest in the plight of refugees. I have visited camps right around the world where I suspect few of my colleagues have ever been. I went to Traiskirchen, where I saw Eastern Europeans. I went to Hong Kong when the Vietnamese were fleeing. I went to Thailand to see the Cambodians who fled over the border. I went to Pakistan to see the Afghans who had fled. I went to the Balkans, where I saw Croats, Serbs, Bosnians and so many others displaced. I went to Kosovo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But perhaps the greatest impact on me was going to Africa and seeing some 90,000 people—and I think the numbers have risen beyond that since then—in a camp called Kakuma, in northern Kenya. There were Congolese, Sudanese, Somalis and Ethiopians. These were not people who would ever meet a people smuggler. These were not people who had money in their pockets to be able to pay to be trafficked to wherever they may have preferred to be! These were people who often were in immediate risk even though they had fled, thinking they might be safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has always fascinated me to know there are 42 million people in the world who are displaced or refugees, with at least 10 million of them assessed to be refugees. In reality, most of those people are never going to be able to find a place for resettlement in the way in which those who make it to Australia and engage our protection obligations have been able to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We ask ourselves, why is it those who have the money to pay to be trafficked should be given priority? What makes it so important that their needs, which are just the same as the other 10 million people's needs, assessed in exactly the same way, are greater? In my more cynical moments I suggest to the government that it could deal with its budget issues. It could go to Kakuma and say: 'Who's got $10,000? We'll give you a place.' When I suggest that to people they laugh. They say, 'The government couldn't go and ask for money to determine who should get a place.' Then why should the places be determined because we are party to a refugee convention, because people can engage a people smuggler who gets them to the front of the queue? I have said that for years, and it justified, in my view—morally and appropriately—every decision I ever took as minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did not need to be in a position where we had some 30,000 people knocking at our door. There were some people on the other side of the chamber, and not many of them are here to hear it, who had a view that I was some dreadful ogre, that the Howard government was unconscionable in the way it dealt with these issues, that the measures we implemented were not needed. It was not a question of whether they would work or not work; they were not needed! They were morally reprehensible! We had a change of government and one by one all of the measures that were in place and working, saving people's lives, preventing people getting on vessels and enabling us to resettle those people who needed help most were stripped away. When the government finds that having stripped away all those measures it has a problem then it does not want to adopt the measures that worked; it thinks it has to find its own way forward. But, progressively, the government is picking up each of the measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a mischievous sense of humour in relation to these things. I do not think there is any one magic bullet in the measures that we used. I do not think it is a menu you can pick and choose from: 'If we adopt this entree that will stop the boats.' In my view you need the full menu. If I were cynical I would say, 'You have to make a meal of it.' But this government is not prepared to do that. It is not prepared to adopt temporary protection visas. They may get a chance to think about that. It is perfectly proper under the refugee convention—that convention makes it very clear that our obligation is not to return people to situations of persecution. That is the obligation. It is not to give them permanent residency—it does not say anything about that. So if you find that circumstances change and people can go home then why should that not happen? It has happened. We did it in relation to the Kosovans we brought to Australia and settled here temporarily. We supported them, and when circumstances were such that they could go home that was the case. There have been times when Afghans have been able to go home. I suspect there will be times when many others who seek to engage our protection obligations could, in fact, go home. I do not think that, in principle, there is anything wrong with it, but the Labor Party has not been prepared to pick it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning boats around: it is fascinating looking at the way in which the government is dealing at the moment with some of the Singhalese and Sri Lankans that are arriving in Australia. Upon initial inquiry it has them on the first plane back that it can find. Yet they are super-critical of those who say, 'Well, if somebody is coming in in a boat and you can safely turn it around, why shouldn't you?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we are debating is about a measure of which the Labor Party said, when we were in office, should not have been pursued. This is about using the colloquial jargon. This is about excision of the whole of Australia from the migration zone. Some people laugh when you say you are going to exclude Australia from the migration zone. But that is what this bill is about. This is the Labor Party, in office, introducing legislation to achieve this end, when they vigorously opposed it before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect it is not going to make very much difference. One of the reasons is that they have made some other decisions about the consequences of what happens if you have not arrived in the migration zone. They go to the way in which your claims are assessed and processed. Effectively, this government took decisions at an earlier point in time in which the consequences of having not arrived in the migration zone have been essentially diminished. Those who are going to be affected by this legislation can be transferred in and out of Australia, but it is not going to affect the way in which their claims are going to be processed and it is not going to affect the multi-tiered approach in relation to judicial review on top of initial decision making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the matters that this government has been responsible for putting in place—those measures that have compounded the problem and made it more difficult for us to get those people who are not refugees out of the system and returned home as quickly as possible and that have ensured we have something like 99 per cent of those people who arrive by boat being found to be refugees, or at least contesting them—will in fact remain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, which the government believes is going to assist, will not deal with those fundamental questions, and they still remain unaddressed. We are dealing with a situation where only several hundred of those 30,000 people who have arrived have been able to be removed—the 500 or so Sri Lankans who have been able to be removed. But the message is still out there for the people-smugglers: if we can get you to Australia you will have a place in which you will be able to stay. I do not believe it, even when the government says it, that they are only going to give people bridging visas, that they are not going to process them in any expeditious way but leave them in limbo for five years, and that that will stop people from working. I do not know what they will do if they find that somebody on a bridging visa has been out there engaging in employment unlawfully. Are they going to say, 'Oh, look, you've breached your visa condition. We are going to terminate it and return you home.' No. They might say, 'We will take you into detention.' But I suspect they will be saying, 'Gee, I hope we don't find anybody, because we have no detention accommodation left.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a situation in which the Labor Party, who held out that they had consciences above everybody else, are now disclosing, absolutely, their hypocrisy in relation to these matters. That needs to be clearly understood by the Australian people. They are adopting measures they hope may enable this issue to be dealt with, but I suspect the half-hearted way in which they are proceeding with these matters will leave them with a continuing problem. I do not like it. I want to see Australia able to hold its head up high helping those refugees who need help most, those people who languish in places like Kakuma and are in immediate risk and danger. They are never going to be helped because the places are being lost to those people who have the money to pay, to those people whom we are seeing day after day continuing to turn up here because smugglers have led them to believe that they can get them to the front of the queue. And it is a queue. Part of the problem is that it is a very long queue. But it is a queue, and the government ought to be able to go out there and hold their heads up high and say, 'We are serious about dealing with these matters.'</span>

I answered it as early as 1995, and no amount of yelling from the opposition changes that fact. In 1995 I dealt with allegations about renovations on my property. I dealt with them again in 2001. I dealt with them again in 2006. I dealt with them again in 2007 after the Liberal Party shopped around a dirt file on me. I have dealt with them on multiple occasions over the course of this year. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: check the transcript from yesterday. I stand by that transcript and what I said about my renovations. I stand by the transcript of my press conference in August. I have dealt with these allegations time and time again. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows that and ought to check the now very available public record.</span>

Clearly we already know from the tactics of the opposition that they will not today raise issues that matter to the Australian people. They will not today raise questions about jobs for Australians. They will not raise questions about health. They will not raise questions about education—and the list goes on. I believe Australians are sick of the Leader of the Opposition and his sleaze and smear tactics. They want to see this parliament use its time properly for the issues that matter in their lives. I thank the member for Deakin for a question that matters to the lives of Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government have a laser focus on jobs, because there is nothing more important to the future of Australians than knowing that they can get jobs, that they can hold secure jobs, that they can have the prospect of a better job and that their sons and daughters can look forward to growing up to be full participants in an economy that can offer them the benefits of work. We have the highest number of Australians in paid employment ever. This has taken hard work. It is taking hard work to keep modernising our economy so we can ensure that that ability to offer Australians jobs continues in the future. We are proud that there are 800,000 more jobs around than there were five years ago. We are proud of what we have done to support the manufacturing sector in difficult times. Of course, we are getting on with creating the jobs of the future, including through the rollout of the National Broadband Network.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a strong and resilient economy we can offer Australians benefits. We are proud we have moved up three places to be in the top dozen largest economies by size in the world. We want to keep moving up those rankings. That is why we are so focused on delivering on our plans for the nation's future during this Asian century of growth and change. It is why we are so focused on delivering on our plans for the future of education, because you cannot win the economic race of the future unless you can win the education race. With the benefits of a strong economy, we can provide people with new benefits, new prosperity to share. I am proud that we are working hard to improve dental health, including in partnership with the states, so that children in low- and middle-income families can benefit. I am proud that we are able to direct that care to where it is needed the most—to children in low- and middle-income families. These are the kinds of things you can do if you have a purpose, if you have a plan and if you work hard on policies for the nation's future.</span>

Everyone on this side of the House has a plan for the future, unlike the rabble opposite who can only come in here and throw smear around as a substitute for putting forward considered policies for the future. We on this side of the House understand how important it is to make investments for the future. Our economy is a beacon of resilience compared to other developed economies around the world, and that has been because past governments, mainly from our side of politics, made the investments for the future and understood the importance of creating jobs now and well into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons our economy is a beacon of resilience is the decisive action that we on this side of the parliament took at the height of the global financial crisis. A consequence of that has been that we did not go into recession and we did not experience the capital destruction and the skill destruction that has occurred across other developed economies. The consequence of that, as the Prime Minister said before, is our economy is 11 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. We are now the 12th largest economy in the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that, if we are to be assured of the future, we have got to keep making the investments for the future. Part of that is good fiscal policy, and because we have put in place good fiscal and budget policy the Reserve Bank has had the scope to adjust interest rates down—the equivalent of six interest rate cuts since November last year. What that means for a lot of people out there who are doing it tough with the cost of living is that, if you have a $300,000 mortgage, you are paying $4,500 a year less than you were paying when the Liberals were last in power. And nobody forgets what happened with interest rates when they were in office: they went up 10 times in a row, despite their claims that they would keep them at record lows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we understand the importance of good fiscal policy, we understand the importance of policies which assist families with the cost of living and we also understand the importance of investing for the future so we can lift productivity and make sure that we are creating jobs well into the future, which is why the government is so focused on investments, not just in the NBN but, most particularly, in education, because we know that is the key to growth in the Asian century. Just compare all of that—compare our plans for the future—with what those opposite are saying at the moment. They are simply stuck in the mud bucket of the past. They do not have a single costed policy that they could put forward in this parliament. Why is that? Because essentially they are led by a policy lightweight. The Leader of the Opposition has not got a clue when it comes to economic policy. He is all venom and no vision. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I was talking before about the equivalent of six interest rate cuts since November last year. As a result, a working family in Greenway with a $300,000 mortgage has made around $2,700 in annual savings from rate cuts in the last 12 months alone. As I said before, a family with a $300,000 mortgage is now saving something like $4,500 a year in repayments compared to when the Liberals were last in office. This is very important, because it comes along with the commitment to assist families with the cost of living and, most particularly for families in Greenway, the Schoolkids Bonus, which of course is opposed by those opposite. We understand the stresses and strains on modern working families, particularly in Greenway—unlike the knuckleheads over there, who will not even support the Schoolkids Bonus.</span>

First, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has spent time with a man who has said he believes he is guilty of fraud and is looking for immunity from that fraud as well as a series of other assertions about his conduct that he himself has made that would make you wonder why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would spend time with such a person. Then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition today has referred to an affidavit from Bob Kernohan. It is a matter of longstanding public record that this affidavit was drawn up by John Pasquarelli of One Nation. So there we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition meeting with a man who, on his own admission, is guilty of fraud, and there is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition coming into this parliament and relying on the work of One Nation for smear, pure and simple.</span>

This matter is dealt with on the transcript of the internal review of Slater &amp; Gordon from September 1995. So, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants the answer to this question, read that transcript, where the matter is dealt with extensively, clearly and truthfully. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is in here engaged in smear in matters that have been clarified on the public record and in the public domain for some time now, and no amount of shaking of heads or pretence from people sitting on the front bench makes it anything other than that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August, through a press conference with the press gallery, one of the longest press conferences ever held in the nation's history by a Prime Minister, I answered questions going to this matter, which was then on the public record because the transcript from the Slater &amp; Gordon interview was on the public record. Here is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition without one shred of proof, without one reason to doubt what is in the public record on this matter—not one shred of proof, not one thing available to her which enables her to raise a realistic doubt about what I said in that 1995 transcript. This is truly pathetic.</span>

I am proud that the government has a strong record on native title, that Labor has a strong record on native title and that, in this year, we have marked the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision. The Mabo decision is one of those things that make you reflect on the nature of political debate and how that political debate is viewed with the remove of history. A divisive political debate where Labor was opposed every step of the way by the conservatives, where they sought to persuade Australians that their backyard was at risk, is now, with the remove of 20 years, accepted as bipartisan settled policy. It might remind people of a few other things that are being debated in this parliament during the course of this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our 2009 reforms to the Native Title Act gave the Federal Court a central role in managing native title claims. Since those reforms, the rate of consent determinations has increased almost fourfold, and I think we would all be very happy to see that: parties working together and coming together for consent determinations. The Attorney-General has recently introduced legislation to bring native title mediation under the control of the Federal Court to ensure that all parties have proper ability to be heard, along with the authority and procedural fairness that comes from court processes. We are now also introducing further reforms to native title, including clearer good-faith provisions, and the Attorney-General is introducing these this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to specific changes to native title respondent funding, I can advise the member that these funding changes are nothing new. They were announced in the 2011 budget along with changes to legal financial assistance schemes across a wide range of areas. They follow an independent review on how government can best ensure that finite legal resources, the assistance funds, can help those in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has provided commercially viable businesses with generous government funding for native title claims for the past 20 years. Now that native title processes are well established, it is not necessary for taxpayers' money to go to commercially viable organisations for native title matters. The revised scheme will continue to provide assistance for new or novel matters and for the costs of disbursements related to native title claims.</span>

In the light of the answer given, could I seek for the House's purposes the details of the cuts involved and a clarification on the issue of unclogging the native title court process. When all practitioners are arguing for an unclogging, how would any cuts in any way in this regard assist in that unclogging? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are talking about processes that are now well established. We are talking about many respondents that are commercially viable entities, and we are therefore talking about those commercially viable entities being able to deal with native title activities through their ordinary business costs. That is why changes in funding, the decisions about funding, have been made. Of course, we are happy to keep the member updated about the progress of this. We obviously would not want to see a clogging up, to use his terminology, of the way in which native title processes work, but that is not our anticipation from this measure.</span>

The apology that I delivered yesterday on behalf of the government has been widely and well received. I acknowledge the support of members of the House for that apology, in particular the member for Fadden, who spoke yesterday on behalf of the opposition, strongly supporting the government's announcement yesterday, in particular, the apology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fraser asked what we are doing to make sure that an apology will be backed up by concrete reform so that we never have to see the need for such an apology again. Members will recall that all of these matters arose in the aftermath of the so-called ADFA Skype incident, where the government set in train a series of reviews, a range of cultural reviews, asking the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Liz Broderick, to conduct a review of the treatment of women in the Australian Defence Force Academy and the Australian Defence Force generally; the decision by the government to allow all areas of combat to be open to women; and the DLA Piper review, which I dealt with yesterday. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the cultural reviews, earlier this year the Chief of the Defence Force, General Hurley, and the then secretary, Duncan Lewis, published Defence's overarching response to that, described as <span style="font-style:italic;">Pathway to</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">hange</span>. That document is now essential reading for all members of the Defence Force. In that document the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary make it clear that in the past there have been mistakes but from here on in there is zero tolerance, there is no acceptance for the turning of a blind eye and there is no acceptance for inappropriate conduct. In the course of yesterday I also announced more detail in terms of the government's and Defence's acceptance of all of the recommendations of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner into the treatment of women in the Australian Defence Force. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member graciously referred to the apology yesterday as historic. There were two other things yesterday which became public which I also regard as historic. Firstly, the government and Defence announced that, when it came to allegations of sexual assault, sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, restrictive reporting would be allowed—in other words, reporting on a confidential basis outside the chain of command. This is unheard of, but we have seen very good experience of this in the United States in recent years. Secondly was the statement by the chiefs of the service committee—the Chief and Vice-Chief of the Defence Force, the secretary and the various service chiefs—that implementation of these reforms would be non-negotiable. Yesterday I said 'our actions and commitment into the future will ensure that the apology given today to those men and women in the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence who have been subject to abuse will never have to be repeated'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, ministers present and future, chiefs of the Defence Force present and future, secretaries present and future and service chiefs present and future will be judged by the way in which we ensure that all of the reforms are implemented to ensure that this never happens again.</span>

I dealt with this publicly yesterday. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to dealing with it publicly. There is a media report today of what I said yesterday and that media report is incorrect. I said yesterday: 'I do not, to the best of my knowledge—I do not remember $5,000 being put in my bank account.' I then went on to explain how my normal experience across my working life of going to the ATM and checking my balance is that you are more likely to get a surprise on the downside rather than the upside. But I had taken steps, because I did want to be in a position, if possible, to produce my bank records, because I thought this matter was likely to be raised. I am not in a position to produce my bank records, simply because the Commonwealth Bank does not retain bank records from 17 years ago.</span>

He would know that his constituents have seen over $91 million invested in 111 projects, benefiting 43 schools across his electorate. But the fact is that Australians are faced with a future. When you think about the future, it is education that is absolutely crucial. It is absolutely crucial to our national prosperity. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we saw new analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers, finding that if we improve our schools to the world's best standards then we could generate over $3 trillion over the life of a child born today. That is the productivity capacity of a good education for Australian students. We have had five years of reform and delivery—reform like the national partnerships, the My School website and delivery where we have seen improvement in facilities right around Australia in schools. Now we have an unprecedented opportunity to take the next step—a national plan for school improvement, a plan that for the first time ensures that all schools get the funding they need to deliver a great education to all students, a plan that recognises the clear link between disadvantage and student performance, a Labor government plan that is underpinned by the principles of equity, excellence in teaching, transparency and accountability, and informed choice for parents. I am asked about alternative plans. The plan was labelled as mad by the shadow minister opposite, who, at the time of the last election, had identified only cuts for education in this country—cuts to trade training centres, cuts to the national partnership to improve teacher quality. In fact he has had a pretty terrible year. It has been 764 days since he has asked a question on education. But here is the opposition's spokesman who thinks that one in seven teachers should be sacked, that we should be considering class sizes that are bigger. And now he has had a brain-fade today by saying that My School should be demolished—the information on the My School website no longer available to parents, no longer available to teachers, no longer available to those of us in this House. That is where we are with the opposition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked about the impacts. Here we are, with a broken funding system on offer from Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne that could see Australian schools around $2 billion worse off over four years, a party that believes there is no connection between low socioeconomic background and student performance, and an opposition leader who believes that the current level of support to 6,743 government schools right around Australia is an injustice. They can carry on with the veneer of smear in this parliament. We will carry on with getting a national plan for school improvement delivered.</span>

The plan was tabled in the parliament at five o'clock yesterday afternoon and became immediately available for disallowance. Overnight a disallowance motion was moved in the Senate by the Greens Senator Hanson-Young and was moved in this house by the member for Riverina and seconded by the member for Murray.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a report which has come online, on the <span style="font-style:italic;">adelaidenow</span> website, by Mark Kenny over the last hour-and-a-half or so which indicates that the coalition as a party will not be supporting disallowance of the plan and will be supporting the additional 450 gigalitres. I want to acknowledge that and welcome that. What that means is that we now have a situation where Australians know, basin communities know and people who care about the Murray-Darling Basin know what the Murray-Darling Basin plan will be, what the approach will be—and they are in no doubt that the basin will be restored to health. They are in no doubt now that for the first time in a century the national approach to the basin that always should have been there will now be there, is now law and will remain law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be the case that members of this parliament will be asked to vote on the disallowance motion that has been moved by the member for Riverina and seconded by the member for Murray. So I should make clear to the House, in answer to the question for the member for Hindmarsh, exactly what disallowance would mean, because it is a similar message for senators dealing with the Hanson-Young resolution. Once disallowed, the plan loses all force of law immediately. It can be reintroduced six months later, but only in an identical form, which would then mean that, if disallowance were successful in either house, the entire process which has been going on since the last election would need to recommence from scratch. Effectively, we would be looking at a situation where the reform—long-awaited and built on over decades—would come to nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that there are some members of the House who have always opposed basin reform and are at least, I guess, being consistent in that view. But I do have to take issue with the attitude that the Greens have taken on this—in the name of the environment. There would be nothing worse for the Murray-Darling Basin than for this plan to be thrown out. There is nothing good for the environment in the approach that the Greens are taking on this issue. There is no doubt that if the Greens were successful in this part of the campaign the next drought would look exactly like the last drought looked. We would see a system approach drought with no level of resilience at all. The members of this House who have committed to reform are on the right side of history on this issue and are making sure that a much-needed reform will serve the basin well into the future.</span>

I refer the Prime Minister to her statement yesterday and to the affidavit of then AWU head Ian Cambridge that states around $100,000 from the AWU slush fund was used to purchase a house in Fitzroy in which Bruce Wilson lived. When did the Prime Minister first learn that funds from the AWU Workplace Reform Association were used in the purchase of the Fitzroy property which her then boyfriend Bruce Wilson lived in?</span>

The reason for that is that you can say anything you like to the media and it has no consequences but if in this place you make statements which are misleading there are consequences.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Inclusion, Minister for Mental Health and Ageing and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:48</span>):  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. In the lead up to the last election the Prime Minister committed that building a modern mental health system would be a priority for this term of government and that we would introduce a new annual report card on mental health and on suicide prevention—a responsibility to the new National Mental Health Commission, which we created earlier this year as part of the government's $2.2 billion mental health reform plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, Professor Allan Fels, the chair of the commission, delivered the first of those annual reports. It is very different to the traditional reports on mental health, which have tended to count things such as hospital beds and doctors and nurses in the health system. While these are undoubtedly important things, this report shifts the focus to telling us how Australia's mental health services are performing from the perspective of people actually using them. The report tracks the degree to which we are supporting those Australians to lead a 'contributing life', to use the language of the Mental Health Commission. Importantly also, the commission does not just focus on the health system; it also looks at those other things that determine the degree to which these Australians are able to live a contributing life—stable housing and a chance of a job, just to name a couple.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In broad terms the commission's report reinforces what I and others in the government have been saying for some time now: while there is much that we are going to expand and improve mental health services, there is still much for us to do. The report card reinforces, for example, the importance of the government's investment in effective, community-based responses to suicide risk. It also urges all of us to focus more on the physical health needs of Australians living with mental illness, in particular, and on their much lower life expectancy. There are also important messages for state governments around the delivery of their long-standing commitments to drive down rates of seclusion and physical restraint in their hospital systems and to prevent situations where Australians with mental illness are discharged from those same hospitals into a situation of homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission intends to build on this report with an even greater focus in future years on the experiences and the views of those who actually use the system—views that will be a valuable guide as the government continues to implement our plan to build a modern mental health system. I am very pleased that the report has already received such strong community and media attention. On behalf of the government—and, I am sure, on behalf of the Prime Minister—I extend my thanks to Professor Fels and the other commissioners for their dedication to this task and for their hard work.</span>

I refer to the Prime Minister's statement yesterday and to the statement today by Slater &amp; Gordon which I am holding my hand and which states that, in relation to the AWU matter, a conflict of interest arose between two clients. The statement indicates that, because Slater &amp; Gordon acted for the AWU, the Prime Minister acted for Bruce Wilson personally and that, when Mr Wilson disclosed the use of the slush fund to purchase the Fitzroy property, Slater &amp; Gordon ceased acting for both clients. Does the Prime Minister still claim that as a partner of Slater &amp; Gordon she did nothing wrong?</span>

Nothing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said or done during the course of today actually raises, as a matter of fact, any wrongdoing. What we have seen from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that she has repeddled allegations I first dealt with in 1995. She has repeddled matters I dealt with comprehensively on the public record yesterday. She has repeddled matters out of an affidavit drawn by a person associated with the formation and operation of One Nation. She has repeddled these matters associated with making wilder and wilder and more and more ridiculous claims in the media. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the opposition generally under this leader, are on a mission of sleaze and smear but they have not got anything credible to say. They are just repeddling incredibly old allegations or matters I have dealt with comprehensively on the public record. Indeed, the Manager of Opposition Business's point of order to try and get an out-of-order question into order actually made the point that these matters have been dealt with by me in statements comprehensively made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I have dealt with this matter over many long years. I have dealt with it comprehensively in front of the media. I have answered questions in here. I have been truthful in those answers. I did nothing wrong, and no amount of smear, repeddled from the best part of 20 years ago, will ever change that.</span>

And we have put extra money into public dental services, too. We have introduced plain packaging—a world first. We have introduced Gardasil vaccination for girls as well as boys—also a world first.

The only thing we have heard from the shadow minister lately is that he is going to cut health jobs just like his mates in Queensland. Medicare Locals are the next big step in primary health care. Medicare Locals employ doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, psychologists, Aboriginal health workers, social workers and others. They provide services like GPs after hours, psychology, childhood immunisation and allied health services in rural and regional areas. They build on what GPs have always done, but they do it in a way that is coordinated and locally driven—local solutions for local healthcare gaps. </span>

Why does the Leader of the Opposition want to stop that? The shadow minister's own Metro North Brisbane Medicare Local has GP services for homeless people and a mobile dental van. Why do those opposite want to stop this? They want to stop this because they have always hated Medicare and they will stop the next front in the rollout of Medicare services. They come in here with an amendment. Their amendment is a $3½ million rebranding exercise. That is not policy; it is an expensive mistake.</span>

                  </a>  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question proceeds on a false premise. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, in order for an association to be incorporated in Western Australia, the intention to incorporate that association has to be advertised. It was so advertised in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper on Friday, 6 March 1992. So persons who bought or read the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper on that day or who had cause to look back on those records at some later date would have seen it—it was there very publicly. It is a requirement of association law. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to create a false premise about what could be known about this association. I refer her to the fact that the incorporation was publicly dealt with in the newspaper. </span>

The Leader of the Opposition has asked me questions up hill and down dale about matters like carbon pricing. He has engaged in hard-hitting speeches in this parliament.

                  </a>  If the opposition genuinely thought there were anything serious at the base of all this, why wouldn't the Leader of the Opposition have the guts to get up and do it himself? We know the answer to that. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to pretend to the Australian people that he is not the person holding this bucket of mud when he most clearly is—and clearly he is doing that because he is incapable of producing a policy or plan in the nation's interest.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:02</span>):  I thank the member for Throsby for his question and for having been such a strong advocate for the 12,800 small businesses in his electorate. He asked me what we have been doing to help small businesses in this country. The first thing we did was to ensure that they did as well as they possibly could when confronted with the global financial crisis. We invested in the economy at a time when private investment was contracting and jobs were at risk. We invested and, as a result of that investment, thousands of small businesses were prevented from hitting the wall—which is what would have happened if those stimulus packages had not been put in place. I remind the House that Tony Abbott and the opposition voted against most of those initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those stimulus packages are a major reason for the current state of the economy. We have very low unemployment, we have confined inflation, we have economic growth just under four per cent, our economy has grown by 11 per cent since the global financial crisis and we have a low ratio of debt to GDP—one-tenth of the average for OECD countries. </span>

                  </a>  We also have—and the member for North Sydney should know this—a lower official cash rate than at any time during the Howard years. Indeed, it is less than half what we inherited. It was 6.75 per cent when we came into office. As a result, we now have an environment in which small businesses can not only survive but thrive—not only as a result of the stimulus packages but as a result of specific measures such as the loss carry-back initiative, the instant asset tax write-off and the tripling of the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $19,200. All of these measures will assist small business in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked about other approaches. Today the ANZ released research showing that small business sales in the three months to the end of October were up by 3.6 per cent and that sales for small business for the year have increased by 8.3 per cent. This is fantastic news for small business. We know it does not result from the efforts of Tony Abbott. We know he is not a friend of small business. </span>

I refer the Prime Minister to her statement yesterday that, after she learned in August 1995 of the AWU's investigations into Bruce Wilson's misuse of funds in Victoria, she did not alert the union about the AWU Workplace Reform Association because she had no knowledge of wrongdoing. Given that the Prime Minister knew of the allegations about misuse of funds in Victoria, why didn't the Prime Minister alert the AWU to the existence of the association in Western Australia so that it could be investigated and a further fraud averted?</span>

I did not create a fund, I did not create a bank account, I did not deal with a bank account. I have said that clearly on the public record. I provided legal advice on the incorporation of an association, and I am pointing the parliament to the advertising of that incorporation. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to interject across the table, why does he not have the guts to get up and ask a question?</span>

The government has been very active on both the trade and foreign policy fronts.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  In the last sitting week the Manager of Opposition Business raised as a matter of privilege two claims that the House had been misled. One concerned an answer that had been given by the Treasurer; the other concerned a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence. I have been able to speak to the Manager of Opposition Business about these matters but I should also report back to the House on them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that a member found to have deliberately misled the House can be found to have committed a contempt. Although many such complaints have been made in the past, to date no Speaker of the House has found that a prima facie case has been made out, and precedent to enable a motion to be referred has never been given as of right. However, the House recently agreed to refer such a matter in relation to the member for Dobell. I have told the Manager of Opposition Business that on the information available to me the circumstances of the matter which he has raised would not justify departure from the position that has been taken by many of my predecessors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue was raised yesterday by the honourable member for Wentworth in respect of the term 'mendacious'. The problem with this word is that it can mean false or untrue, but it can also mean lying. I make four points. First, like all Speakers I judge these matters not only on the actual words used but having regard to the circumstances and the context in which they are used. Secondly, members may not accuse each other of lying. Accordingly, if a sharp accusation is directed to a member in terms such as 'You are mendacious,' I would regard it as unparliamentary.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeContinuation">The SPEAKER:</span>  You can laugh all you like but this is the standard that has been set over many years. In other circumstances the word might be allowed; for example, the statement 'That is mendacious' or a reference to the government's or opposition's mendacity might be tolerated. Third, I repeat that I will not issue a list of words that may not be used. Such a list is unhelpful and does not recognise the importance of tone and context.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I assure the House that I applaud all efforts to improve the civility of our proceedings and I am sure members share this goal. I ask them to exercise restraint in the terms they use about each other.</span>

I said the NAPLAN raw data should not be published on the MySchool website, and that is an entirely different matter to closing down the website.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a serious matter—five years of failure that have no peer. Earlier in this place today we were debating, as we continue to debate, the excision bill that is currently before the parliament. Back in 2006, it was the current Minister for Immigration and Citizenship who described that bill, should it be passed, as 'a stain on our national character'. One thing that is very clear is that the only stain is on that side of the House for their failure to put in place effective border protection measures over the last five years. In that 2006 speech, the minister for immigration said that he thought amending the bill was 'like putting lipstick on a pig'. The government's hypocrisy is such that it is now coming into this place trying to use that very pig, as the minister described it, to try and save their own political bacon—because it is this government, as it creeps from failure to backflip on this issue, that continues to repeat every single day it is in office the failures that have put Australia in such an adverse position when it comes to our borders. Labor's failures on our borders are without peer and, without any doubt, they have exceeded our worst expectations. Five years of failure, rising costs, chaos, tragedy and now hypocrisy on a grand scale: all of this has been on Labor's watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer now to page 2 of the Immigration Detention Statistics Summary of 23 November 2007, the day before the federal election of that year. When the Howard government left office in November 2007, the number of people who had arrived illegally in Australia by boat, described in here as 'unauthorised boat arrivals', who were in any form of detention—including community detention, alternative temporary detention in the community, immigration detention centres, residential housing and immigration transit accommodation, all of these places—was four. Four.</span>

                  </a>  Four. You could count the number of people who had arrived illegally by boat who were in any form of detention, going through processing, on one hand. There were four. I seek leave to table the document.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr MORRISON:</span>
                  </a>  I turn now to the Immigration Detention Statistics Summary for 30 September 2012, the most recent that the government has published. It is a much bigger report this time; it goes for far more pages—there is a lot more to report. Going to page 5 of that report, the number of people in any of those forms of detention I just referred to who had arrived illegally by boat as of 30 September 2012 was 8,987. Now, that does not include the 4,000 or thereabouts we estimate are on bridging visas and out in the community, following the government's decision on 25 November last year; and it does not include the 4,000 that have turned up since that report was published. So it has gone from just four people to, we estimate now—including those inside and outside detention—over 12,000. If those metrics do not speak of policy failure, then I do not know what does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very interesting chart in that report. It is a chart showing the population in immigration detention since January 1990. If you want to know what lift-off looks like, this is what it looks like. When you get to January 2009, once the effects of the government's decision to abolish the Howard government measures took place, you get lift-off when it comes to illegal boat arrivals. You get lift-off. That graph is included in the earlier reports, Madam Speaker, and I seek leave to table that report of 30 September 2012.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr MORRISON:</span>
                  </a>  We have had to produce that result. Over 30,000 people have arrived on illegal boats since this government abolished the effective policies of the Howard government. That is a large number of people. The numbers that we might take under our immigration program may be relatively smaller, but 30,000 people is a lot of people. To give people an idea of how many people that might be: it is bigger than a town like Alice, as I said on the weekend; it is bigger than Albany; it is bigger than Busselton, as the member behind me mentioned; it is 1½ times the size of Goulburn; it is bigger than the city of Warrnambool; it is bigger than Nowra-Bomaderry, where I was last week; it is bigger than Mount Gambier; it is bigger than Gawler; it is bigger than Victor Harbor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to get another idea of how many people have turned up, then maybe the member for Lindsay can assist. The next time the member for Lindsay, the commander, is piped aboard the Panthers' stadium out there in Penrith, he should know that the number of people who have arrived on illegal boats under the watch of the government of which he has been a part is 1½ times the number of people you can put into the Panthers' stadium; it is 1½ times the number that you can put into the Sharks' stadium, in my own electorate of Cronulla; it is 1½ times the number you can put into Parramatta Stadium. For any major rugby league ground you go to, whether in New South Wales or Queensland, you will find that it is 1½ times the number you can put in it. It is more than you can put into Canberra Stadium, not far from this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty thousand is a significant number to have arrived. For the Howard government to achieve that, it would have taken half a millennium, in terms of the number of people that arrived in the last six years after the Howard government's effective border protection policies were put in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the record of the government's failure on our borders, and it is getting worse. It is not getting better, it is getting worse, because more than half of those arrivals have turned up since the beginning of this year. More than a third of them have turned up since 1 July this year. Remember: on 1 July this year, the Treasurer stood at that dispatch box and presented a budget which said that the average number of people he estimated arrived every month was 450. The average figure for this financial year is more than 2,000. If you were to use the methodology adopted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for when MYEFO would have updated that figure, the 30-month average, then the figure now underpinning the budget would be around 715 per month, which is less than half what is occurring, which means that this budget, if anyone ever doubted it in the first place, is blown, and they have blown it on boats alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of these increases in arrivals is breathtaking. The blow-out alone over the last four years, going out over the forward estimates, is $6.6 billion, and that does not include the cost of increasing the refugee and humanitarian intake, which is the policy of this government, to 20,000, which is 25,000 extra places over the next four years at a cost of $1.3 billion and at a cost of more than $50,000 per place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To give people some understanding of the rate of increase: in 2007-08, the cost of managing this issue was $85 million a year; in this year, not including capital costs, the cost will be $2.4 billion. This chart I am showing sets out—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr MORRISON:</span>
                  </a>  the high level of increase in costs, which we have seen to rise from $85 million a year to $113 million in 2008-09, to $292 million in 2009-10, to $879 million in 2010-11, to $1.4 billion in 2011-12, and this year to $2.4 billion—and that is based on a budget which is estimating arrivals at less than half the rate that is occurring. This is a government that has blown the borders and, as a result, they have blown the budget, too, without any hesitation of doubt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The humanitarian consequences of these failures are the most significant, and we know of the loss of life that has occurred over the last five years—we estimate it to be over 1,000 people; how many it is, we really do not know. We also know that over 8,000 people have missed out on protection visas in Australia, waiting in places all around the world, because they did not come on a boat under this government. These are the human costs of the government's failure over the last five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It all results and stems from an unwillingness by the government to recognise when they have got something wrong—and I do not mean politically wrong, because that is the only thing the government ever seems to be able to come to terms with, but when they have got the policy wrong. And these policies will continue to fail as long as the government continues to cling to the failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have decided—rather than to restore the measures that worked, as the member for Berowra was saying just before we came in here for question time—to go their own way. And go their own way they have. They decided to chance their arm, and the record of failure is as I have related to the House: the asylum freeze, the East Timor farce, and the failed Malaysian people swap, which the government itself has abandoned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government itself abandoned the Malaysian people swap, refusing to take any genuine action after the Houston report. We continue to make clear our objections to this policy, but the government itself has decided to just drop it, leave it alone and blame the opposition rather than take action. Yet one of the key actions they could take is this. Malaysia has a choice, and the government has a choice in its dealings with Malaysia. Malaysia could sign the refugee convention which would ensure there were binding legal protections in Malaysia. I think that is highly unlikely. I do not think it will happen. The other thing Malaysia could do, which the government could negotiate for, is to introduce legally binding protections in their immigration act. Has the minister raised that with the Malaysian government since the Houston report was handed down? I doubt it, given that a year ago, almost, he told me that they had rejected that notion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy of bridging visas and community release announced just a year ago on 25 November has proved to be an absolute disaster, with over 16,000 people—well over half of the total arrivals—turning up since the government introduced that policy. After being dragged kicking and screaming to reopen Nauru and Manus Island, the daily problems of the government's inability to implement anything effectively continue to be demonstrated, and I will have the opportunity to witness that firsthand when I head to Nauru next week. The no-advantage policy which the government have thrown their arms around but are yet incapable of explaining to anyone also continues to be a thorn in the side of a government struggling and still trying to find their way on an issue where the Prime Minister herself said they had lost their way when she took office. They are no closer to finding it today. In fact, they are further away than they have ever been.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a different and better way forward. It is the way forward that the coalition offered when we were in government and it can turn failure around and turn it into success. It can turn it into success with policies that have worked. Those policies still have their doubters, just as they had back in 2001. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> on 1 September 2001, it was said when John Howard had turned around the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span>: 'The government is hoping its hard-line approach towards the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> will bear fruit. That is unlikely given the global reality of 22 million refugees, many of whom are languishing in countries on the Indian Ocean Rim.' Well, they were wrong. All those who said John Howard's policies would not work were wrong. Those who say they will not work again are wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will restore those policies, and we will ensure that this country once again has a government that believes in strong border protection and implements strong border protection. As we go to the next election, there will be a simple question: who do you trust to protect the nation's borders—the mob who have trashed our borders with over 30,000 arrivals, $6.6 billion in cost blowouts and carnage, chaos, cost and tragedy to back up that record, or a coalition who have the conviction, the belief, the policy, the resolve and the record? That is the choice. By making the choice of the coalition we can send a message to the people smugglers that they will understand.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  It is now almost 12 months since 200 people died off the coast of Indonesia. On 18 December, 200 people drowned off the coast of Java trying to get to Australia. About 100 bodies were eventually washed up upon the shore; 100 remained at the bottom of the Java Sea. A lot of people have forgotten about that, but I have not. I had been in the job for about four days and the events of that day and the subsequent days are scarred on my memory. The first reports of 87 people having survived were followed by more disappointing reports that only 33 had survived. We saw images on our TV screens and in our newspapers of exhausted, half-dead survivors and heard the stories that followed of people being swallowed up by the ocean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately that is what this debate is all about. It is about stopping a repeat of this. It deserves better than the yelling and screaming and the smart lines that often pass for debate on this issue. That is what is wrong with this debate: it has been poisoned by politics. It is rancid with politics. The great irony of all this is that the major parties agree on most things here. The difference is at the margins. But you would not know it from this debate and you would not know it from what you read in the newspapers and see on TV or hear in this place. Why? The reason is that this is not a debate that is principally about policy; it is a debate that is about politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you an example. Four days before those 200 people drowned almost a year ago, the Prime Minister wrote to the Leader of the Opposition. In that letter, the Prime Minister said to the Leader of the Opposition: 'The Australian people expect us to work together to ensure that the national interest is upheld. I would be happy to make Minister Bowen available to meet with Mr Morrison in an attempt to identify a mutually satisfactory outcome.' Two days later, two days before those 200 people drowned, the Leader of the Opposition wrote back. In that letter that Leader of the Opposition in response said: 'I do not see much point.' So you have the Prime Minister in her letter reaching out, saying, 'We need to work together,' and you have an opposition leader in response saying, 'I do not see much point.' He did not see much point in even having a meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day after those people died, the government wrote to the Leader of the Opposition again and asked him to make the shadow minister for immigration available to sit down with the minister to reach a compromise. He still refused and then he demanded a written proposal from the government before any talks could begin. So we did that. The government gave him a written proposal where we put on the table the offer to implement offshore processing in Nauru and the government's plan with Malaysia. Then, on the morning before those talks were to begin, on the morning before Mr Bowen and Mr Morrison were to sit down, the Leader of the Opposition held a press conference and rejected the written proposal that we had made. So, in effect, the negotiations ended before they began. All of that was in the aftermath of 200 people dying, and he still refused to give the government the powers that we think we need to stop people risking their lives by getting on a boat and possibly dying at sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That refusal still exists today. The Leader of the Opposition still refuses to pass legislation to send people to Malaysia. Why is that? My view is that this is about politics. In the debate that we had on this very same issue only a few weeks ago, I pulled out a quote from David Marr's article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Essay</span>. It is a quote that bears repeating. On page 36 of that essay, he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">WikiLeaks told us how keen the Coalition is to exploit the boats. In late 2009, in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership of the Opposition, a "key Liberal party strategist" popped in to the US embassy in Canberra to say how pleased the party was that refugee boats were, once again, making their way to Christmas Island. "The issue was 'fantastic," he said. "And 'the more boats that come the better." But he admitted they had yet to find a way to make the issue work in their favour: "his research indicated only a 'slight trend' towards the Coalition."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That quote tells you everything you need to know about this debate. It tells you why it is so hard to come to an agreement between the two major parties. It explains everything that is going on here. A senior Liberal Party strategist went to the United States embassy to have a meeting, saying 'this issue is fantastic' and 'the more boats that come the better' and expressing their disappointment that they had not been able to get more political benefit out of it already. That is what is wrong with this debate: people who think like this, people who say things like that and people who are more concerned about political advantage than they are about the boats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Mr Frydenberg interjecting</span>—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWL" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CLARE:</span>
                  </a>  The member for Kooyong might express his disappointment. I know he is a man who would never say things like that. The problem is there are people like that who have decided that the more boats that come the better. We are better than this. The member for Kooyong is better than that and we as a parliament are better than that. We have to get rid of comments like that if we are going to sort this issue out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no easy answers in all of this. This is a wretchedly difficult area of public policy. There are plenty of views, plenty of ideas about how to address it. My view is this. Whatever you think the solution is, we should all agree on this: the government of the day should be given the power that it believes it needs to stop people dying. That is what we did when we were in opposition, when we gave support to John Howard's laws to implement offshore processing, and that is what we have been denied in government by the Liberal Party, by the National Party and by the Greens party. They have all refused to give us the powers that we have come to the view are necessary to help stop people dying at sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we set up an expert panel to help to break this political impasse. Headed by Angus Houston, it made 22 recommendations, including offshore processing Nauru—and we have started offshore processing there—and at Manus. That has now begun. It also included doubling the number of refugees that we will take each year, part of increasing our humanitarian program from 13,500 to 20,000. That has been done. We are increasing co-operation, as recommended, between Australia and Indonesia on search and rescue. I visited Indonesia in September with Minister Smith and Minister Albanese and we agreed to six measures to help to do that. That includes making sure that Australian search and rescue gives Indonesian search and rescue the type of ship tracking information and communication via satellite that is necessary to get in touch with merchant ships as quickly as possible and an agreement with Indonesia to allow our search and rescue planes to land and refuel in Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report from Angus Houston and the expert panel also talked about the importance of disrupting boat ventures—stopping people getting on boats before they set to sea. The latest information on that is that so far this year 209 disruptions have occurred, involving 7,964 people, including 120 disruptions from Indonesia, 65 from Sri Lanka, 14 from Thailand, five from Malaysia, four from India and one from Vietnam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also flying people back to Sri Lanka who are not refugees. In the past few weeks we have flown home 650 people, including 50 people today, and there is more to come. The biggest increase that we have seen in boats this year is from Sri Lanka. They are more than half the number, and many of the people on these boats are not refugees. They are economic migrants—people seeking a job, people seeking a better life. They are not entitled to protection, and that is why they are being sent home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of this should not be underestimated. The threat of death has not deterred many from getting on a boat. But this should. There is no point in paying a people smuggler thousands of dollars to get on a boat if you are going to be flown straight home. That message will hopefully get through to people in Sri Lanka who are thinking about trying their luck and getting on a boat when they see someone in the street who they thought had gone on a boat only a few weeks ago and who is now back home in Sri Lanka. The media plays an important role in getting this message through to people who are thinking about getting on a boat. The headline in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span> in Colombo, one of its major newspapers, said this last Tuesday:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia issues fresh warning to Lankan 'Boat people'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">'YOU'LL BE PACKED OFF IN FIRST AVAILABLE FLIGHT'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a tough message, a strong message, but an important message. It is designed to help save lives. It is designed to stop people making that decision to waste their money and potentially risk their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to do all of these things I have just outlined and more on top of that. We have to implement each and every one of the recommendations that Angus Houston and his panel recommended. That means Nauru. It means Manus Island. It also means Malaysia. If we are going to tackle this problem for good, we need a regional solution and Malaysia is part of that. That is what the report said. It said it was critical. The opposition have refused to support Malaysia, and the shadow minister articulated that again in the debate today. Their argument is that Malaysia has not signed the UN refugee convention. That is a false excuse. It is an argument that has been made up by the opposition to hide behind. They sent people to Nauru for six years and Nauru was never a signatory to the refugee convention during that time. They oppose Malaysia not because it has not signed the UN convention on refugees but because it suits their political objectives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is the height of hypocrisy to criticise the government on this issue and refuse to give us the powers we believe we need to stop people risking their lives at sea. This is an issue that is too important for that sort of politics. We have to be prepared, on this issue at least, to work together. We have to be prepared to compromise, and if that means changing your position then so be it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion talks about consistency. It would have you believe that the opposition have not changed their policy on this issue in 10 years. That is not correct. Both parties have changed their position. Only 3½ years ago the opposition, with its former shadow minister for immigration, supported the closure of Nauru and supported the closure of Manus Island. On <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> the former shadow minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We don't need the Pacific Solution now, that's Nauru Island and Manus Island, because we have the Christmas Island centre completed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both sides have changed their position. You change your position when the facts change and you change your position if that is what it takes to save lives. That is what we ask the opposition now: give us the powers that we believe we need to help stop people dying at sea. We have been fighting about this issue now for 11 years. We have been fighting about it since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> arrived. Australians have had a gutful of it. They want us to stop shouting at each other and start talking to each other. They want us to work together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you need more proof of the importance of doing that, look at the story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sun Herald</span> on the weekend that tells of another boat and another 33 people who drowned last month. Only one person survived—a 22-year-old man rescued by a fishing boat, who is now in an Indonesian detention centre. He paid $5½ thousand to a people smuggler called Sikander. He says the boat took off on 26 October and, on the way to Australia, the engine stopped. The phone they had did not work. The boat began to sink. This is what he told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sun-Herald</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">''On the first day there was hope. Everyone was optimistic,'' he said. ''We were praying, saying there will be an island, there will be a boat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">''On the second day, some people, they lost control, shouting and crying, saying, 'No one will help us.' One guy was in very bad condition. He lost his grip of the rope and went away and he was screaming, crying a few times. After that we didn't hear him any more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">''Then time was passing, night was coming, and the day passing, losing friends. I would see dead bodies coming from the right side, left side. Everyone, one by one, was waiting for their turn because everyone knew that there may not be help, there may not be any chance for a second life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">''Some guys got crazy, they were talking and fighting, they let go of the rope and went away. On the third night there were seven people on the rope, but … in the morning, there were only three people left including me.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, there was only one. That is just one story. There are a lot of stories like this—too many.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Monsoon season is fast upon us. Last December, 200 people died. The December before that, dozens more died when a ship hit the rocks on the coast of Christmas Island. I dread what might happen in the days and weeks ahead. We have got to stop yelling at each other and start talking to each other about this issue. I urge anyone that is thinking about getting onto a boat: don't; don't do it; don't risk your life. And I sincerely urge all of us parliamentarians to be worthy of the name and to work together to stop this happening again.</span>

The Labor Party has put this. The minister just put it. Other ministers have put it at various points. I can assure the minister and I can assure the Australian people that that is complete and utter nonsense. We do want to see this issue resolved and we would always be prepared to work with the government to resolve it. But, if we are going to work with the government, they need to embrace policies that are actually going to work, something that has completely eluded them for the whole five years they have been in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what policies are going to work, because we implemented them in government when we were faced with a similar situation. You know what? They actually worked to resolve this problem. The whole reason that this problem recurred, the whole reason that we went from having four people in the detention network when the government changed and an average of three boat arrivals in any given year of the last six years of the Howard government, was that when the Labor Party came to office, in an absolute fit of some form of moral superiority—they wanted to put their credentials on display about how they were so much better humanitarians than the Howard government—they instituted a series of policy backflips that undermined the robust system of border protection that they had inherited, and that led to the re-emergence of people smuggling. People smuggling was dead and buried under the previous government. When the Labor Party came to office, they restarted people smuggling by not understanding the implications of the policies that they were pursuing.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is entirely inappropriate to suggest that the government is running people-smuggling processes. The shadow minister should not be allowed to make such an assertion in this debate. It is a serious issue. We do not always agree with each other, but it can be debated in an appropriate way. To make that sort of assertion about the government is an outrageous slur and he should not be able to do that in the debate.</span>

                  </a>  I did not say anything of the sort. This is the ludicrous misrepresentation that we get from a government that do not understand the implications of the policy decisions that they have taken. They still refuse to admit that it was those policy decisions that have led Australia down this blind alley—with over 30,000 people arriving here illegally on over 500 boats—from a problem that was solved when they came to office. The reason that we are dealing with it again is specifically because of the Labor Party's misguided policies. The reason that they are not going to be able to deal with it now is that, since they took those policy decisions of August 2008 that reinvigorated people smuggling, they have had a whole series of policy prescriptions, none of which they have been able to implement effectively, all of which they have announced and then either been unable to implement or not had the resolve to implement. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we say now that it is the Labor Party themselves that are the obstacle for us to get any resolution to this issue. Even if the Labor Party were to come up with another policy tomorrow—and for all we know that is possible—why would the criminal gangs of people smugglers, who have been benefiting from the failed policies that the government have been pursuing since they came to office, take them remotely seriously when they say that they are going to do something differently to attack the people-smuggling trade?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard it all before, as have the people smugglers, who are sophisticated enough to understand the implications of the policy debate here in Australia. These fateful decisions were taken in August 2008. The abolition of the Pacific solution and the abolition of temporary protection visas were the policies that allowed the people-smuggling trade to once again emerge, and this is why we have been inundated with illegal boat arrivals ever since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the misguided policies that were taken by the Labor Party have been compounded every time they have dealt with this issue. They reinvigorated the people-smuggling trade, and, when the people smugglers started sending people down to Australia illegally, the government initially denied that they had a problem. They denied that this was a real issue. They subsequently pinned it on international factors. We had minister after minister roll up to the dispatch box in this place and say: 'Well, it's got nothing to do with us. It's a turbulent international environment and that means people are going to seek to come here illegally.' They have now abandoned that excuse too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, one of the reasons the now Prime Minister Julia Gillard dispatched the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was his inability, as she saw it, to deal with the border protection crisis. By the time the government approached the 2010 election, they knew they had a political problem on their hands, so they did re-embrace something that they had been vilifying for a long time, and that is a regional processing centre. They said they were going to put a regional processing centre on the island nation of East Timor. They did so without doing any homework. It was announced as part of the Labor Party's policy platform for that election. They did not do their due diligence with the East Timorese government, who were taken by surprise by this announcement. Subsequently, that announcement was completely dead on arrival. They continued to push it as though it was somehow a live issue, as though somehow the East Timorese were considering it, to the detriment of actually coming up with an answer to this problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, they faced reality and abandoned that, and they subsequently came up with this Malaysia people swap arrangement. The minister, as you heard, was going on about how, if we were to allow them to do the Malaysia people swap, this would somehow contribute to stopping people smuggling. He neglects to mention a few very salient points about that arrangement. Firstly, Malaysia is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and therefore, if you were to send people there for processing, they would not be subject to the sorts of safeguards that we would expect them to be subject to. Secondly, and I think very importantly—and this is often lost in this debate—is that the arrangement that the Labor Party negotiated with Malaysia was a 4,000-for-800 people swap, so we were only going to send a maximum of 800 people to be processed there. In the context of illegal arrivals at the moment, that is about a week and a half of illegal arrivals—and they say that somehow this is going to be the silver bullet that gets people smugglers to take them seriously for once! The Malaysia arrangement was never going to do that. It is a flawed arrangement from our perspective because it does not provide the protections that we would expect, and it certainly does not provide the scale that is the result of the Labor Party's failed border protection policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been subsequent positions that the government has taken—and it would be very difficult for me to list them all. I am not sure that even Labor backbenchers or ministers can keep up with all the iterations of the Labor Party's border protection policies over the past five years. What we can say categorically about them, though, is that every single one of them has failed to do anything to put a dent in people smuggling. Even the announcement of going back for offshore processing in Nauru and Manus, which was a step in the right direction, has done nothing but accelerate the rate of illegal arrivals. Indeed, 25 per cent of the 30,000 people that have been smuggled here illegally under this government have come since that announcement was made on 13 August.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can only conclude that the problem is now not the policies; it is the Labor Party themselves. They cannot now credibly come into this parliament or go outside this parliament and say, 'We've now got a new idea for something that's going to close down people smuggling,' because why would anybody, let alone the people smugglers, take them seriously when they have had such a litany of failure on this issue and, of course, it was their policies that started this issue in the first place?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  On 18 October 2001 an Indonesian fishing boat left the port of Bandar Lampung. There were 421 people on board, including at least 70 children. The boat was 20 metres long and four metres wide, so people were tightly packed on board. The next day, about 70 kilometres south of Indonesia, the boat encountered heavy seas, took on water, listed violently to one side, capsized and sank within an hour. There were life jackets on board, but none of them worked. As a Senate committee chaired by the late, great, Senator Peter Cook concluded, there were at least 70 children aboard when SIEVX sank. Only three survived. Two hundred adults also lost their lives. This was the precursor to many more deaths at sea over the next decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are where we are today because Australia, as an island continent, is a dangerous place to journey to. We are where we are today because the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is a document largely drafted in the aftermath of World War II to deal with what were by today's standards relatively moderate asylum seeker flows across land. We are where we are today because Australia faces a unique challenge. Four per cent of those who take boats to get to Australia perish on the seas attempting to do so, so our policies need to be targeted at stopping those deaths at sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are those in both houses who have served on the SIEVX inquiry, and there are other parliamentarians who have served on the Christmas Island inquiry. We have just heard the Minister for Justice speak movingly about some of the more recent tragedies that have occurred. I believe that in this debate there is no compassion in a policy which says that, if you take a leaky boat to Australia and make it, you can stay. I do not think that that policy is a compassionate one. I do not think that that policy is one which aligns with the value of the Labor Party, a party that I am privileged to represent in this place. What we have done through putting the Malaysian agreement before this parliament—an agreement rejected by an alliance of those to the left and to the right of us—has been to try and ensure that we do not create incentives for people to make the dangerous boat journey here. That Malaysian agreement was struck down by the High Court, and legislation to enable it was unable to pass through this parliament. We then found ourselves in a position where a productive exchange of letters over the Christmas break last year between the opposition immigration spokesperson and the government immigration spokesperson was stymied when the Leader of the Opposition became involved. It became almost absurd. The member for Cook was asked at one point: 'If the government were to adopt all of your policies, would you support them?' and he could not even say yes to that. So, as an attempted circuit-breaker, this government asked three distinguished Australians—Angus Houston, Michael L'Estrange and Paris Aristotle—to come up with a report which would look at how we could prevent tragic drownings at sea. When the Houston report came down, the government immediately announced we would follow its recommendations. All we have unfortunately seen from those opposite is an attempt to try to play politics with one of the most difficult issues in Australian public life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three facts that I do not think have received significant discussion in public commentary on this issue. First, the humanitarian intake in Australia has been increased by 45 per cent to 20,000 places. I called for that in a speech at the end of last year and was extremely pleased when it was adopted. That is 45 per cent more people who are able to enjoy the high-quality humanitarian settlement process in Australia. Subject to economic circumstances, that will be increased to 27,000 places in the next five years. That cements Australia's position as the leading resettlement country globally on a per capita basis, according to United Nations data.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, Australia has been a world leader in how we provide those settlement services. I am enormously proud of the charities—some of them religious, some of them not—in my electorate of Fraser who work hard with newly arrived refugees. In some cases this will be a young Afghan boy who has lost his parents or whose parents have not joined him here and who is struggling to learn English and fit into the local community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberrans have accepted refugees from Sudan, and many of them are making a great contribution to our city. In fact, I was pleased to start the day playing a game of basketball outside Parliament House with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the member for Chifley Senator Lundy and a range of parliamentary staff. We were playing against the Big Bang Ballers—a phrase not best said 10 times quickly—a group run by Pierre Johannessen in Canberra. Pierre works with at-risk youth who play Saturday night basketball. Many of the youth who join in are migrant youth or refugee youth. The Sudanese blokes on the other team certainly ran rings around me. But it is testament to the Canberra community that we are able to work on that resettlement so well.</span>

It decreased from 277 days in November 2011 to 93 days in June 2012. The government is reducing the amount of time that people spend in detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In re-opening the Nauru and Manus Island facilities, we are also providing external scrutiny, something that never existed when the Howard government was in power. Amnesty International has recently brought down a critical report on the Nauru detention centre. The government does not agree with all of the findings in that report. But it is important to note that that report would not have been possible under the Howard government. Next week I understand the member for Cook is travelling to Nauru—again, something that would not have been possible under the Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That internal scrutiny is important to me as somebody who believes that it is important to deter people from making a dangerous boat journey, but we must also treat with dignity and compassion those who make that journey. You will not hear me, as the member for Cook and the member for Stirling said, describing as illegals those who come as asylum seekers. It is not illegal to seek refuge in another country. You also will not hear me attempting to have it both ways on the refugee convention. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 shortly before question time, I discussed some of the circumstances that determine why a country signs or does not sign the refugee convention. I find it passing strange that the opposition is willing to turn boats back to Indonesia—a dangerous attempt which could endanger the lives of not only asylum seekers but also Navy personnel—given that Indonesia is a non-signatory country. We believe that it is important to recognise that circumstances have changed since the refugee convention was signed and to find an approach that is humane and compassionate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="9K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms GAMBARO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  Since November 2007, the government has lost control of Australia's borders. As I said in previous speeches to this House, Labor's border protection policies should be likened to an employment program for people smugglers. The Howard government put them out of business and Labor resurrected them. Since November 2007, Labor's failures on our borders have gotten worse, and their half-hearted policies and commitment is not up to the job. Labor's dismantling of the coalition's border protection policies have resulted in more than 30,000 arrivals. Of the 30,057 arrivals on 515 boats, more than half of this number—15,403—have turned up this year, and more than one-third—10,146—had turned up since July 1. Beyond the catastrophic loss of life and the inability to discourage people smugglers, Labor's border protection failures have also equated to a $6.6 billion budget blowout since 2009-10. This blowout does not include the additional $1.3 billion required to increase Australia's refugee and humanitarian intake to 20,000—up from 13,750—as part of the Houston report's recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a public policy disaster in both humanitarian terms and budgetary terms. There is no other way to describe it. In 2011-12, the government spent more than $4 billion on humanitarian services for migrants and refugees. In 2012-13, it is estimated that will increase to almost $4.28 billion, according to their budget estimates. The astronomical cost impacts that flow from Labor's horrendous border protection policies mean that the delivery of effective settlement services for new migrants and refugees have got that much harder. Somehow, we have got to do that with $6.6 billion less in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, it is true that we had good settlement policies. The member for Fraser was earlier quoting Antonio Guterres, and he said that Australia has some of the best settlement services in the world. We have had in the past a good settlement policy and good settlement programs and we have settled many, many refugees—some 750,000 since World War II. But, those settlement services are at risk. Labor's border protection failures and gross inefficiencies in the management of the migrant and refugee settlement programs have placed enormous pressures on both settlement services and settlement service providers throughout Australia, and they are going to cause danger to social cohesion in this country. The increase in the humanitarian intake to 20,000 will also stretch and put more pressure on infrastructure, more pressure on education, more pressure on the health sector and more pressure on housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the housing sector and the availability of accommodation, a number of settlement service providers have already reported to me that the scarcity of available housing services has led to rental bidding wars which is causing rental prices to go up in many areas that are relying on public housing waiting lists. In Western Australia alone, there is a seven-year waiting list for public housing. I want to commend the terribly hard work that agencies like the Red Cross and others have to do when they have to house asylum seekers, because it is getting more and more difficult as this government's policies fail and we are getting more and more people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many settlement services provided. One that I want to talk about is the English language service to new migrants and refugees. The primary vehicle for delivering these English-language programs is the Adult Migrant English Program, or AMEP. Language skills are universally acknowledged throughout the world as being a critical and a very core component of positive settlement outcomes. As such, one would expect that Australia's settlement service programs for new migrants and refugees would be geared at delivering outcomes that result in higher levels of literacy and good positive language outcomes. But, how are we going at the moment? At the moment, the AMEP will cost the Australian taxpayer more than $220 million in 2012-13, and that is not small change in anybody's language. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During a Senate estimates hearing in February this year, it was mentioned that there was increasing pressure to deliver an adequate AMEP program and that participants were issued with certificates although they did not even have functional English proficiency, and a further 14 per cent of participants were issued with certificates just for turning up. It is absolutely beyond me how any government would issue a certificate for just turning up. Here we have a program that has a 68 per cent failure rate for a $220 million investment. Poor English language skills result in poor and very poor employment outcomes. Poor employment outcomes trap new migrants on welfare dependency and reinforce a sense of failure, not just for new migrants and refugees themselves, but for the wider Australian community, which in turn creates pressures on social cohesion. Apart from that $220 million price tag, what is even more galling is the extremely poor results being produced from that program. Labor is well aware of the consequential negative flows, particularly from underperforming programs, yet still introduces these very clunky template approaches to service delivery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government initiated a report last year. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship produced the report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Settlement Outcomes of New Arrivals</span>, which found that 83 per cent of refugees were still on some form of Centrelink benefit more than five years after they arrived in this country. I had the opportunity recently to visit many parts of regional Queensland and to meet with settlement service providers. They highlighted the pressures on language services and on-the-job service programs for new migrants and refugees who have not arrived in this country illegally, but the ones who have arrived legally. Also, they expressed concern to me about the dramatic increase in irregular maritime arrivals. For example, I just want to highlight one of these areas. In Toowoomba, there are 3,000 new migrants and refugees from sub-Saharan Africa. After five years, 70 per cent of them still are not able to find permanent employment. Far from setting up new migrants and refugees who are legally in this country to succeed, we are now setting up people to fail because of Labor's failed border protection policies. I turn to discuss the unaccompanied minors on humanitarian visas in Australia. A report was recently done by the Multicultural Youth Advocacy Network and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. It was released on 16 October this year and includes some very disturbing facts. It highlighted again Labor's neglect, which has left unaccompanied minors vulnerable to online predators. The report reveals that, as of 30 June, there were some 865 unaccompanied minors living in Australia and that, in addition to being without their parents, these young people had to arrange their own carers. How did they arrange their own carers? They went on Facebook—how else would you arrange your own carer!—and other social networking sites. To anyone who is a parent, that is absolutely appalling. Imagine your child being in a strange country by themselves—without you to protect them and unable to speak the local language—and looking for a carer on the internet. Does that sound like a good system to you? It scares the hell out of me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem of children looking for carers on the internet was highlighted in a report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> titled 'Asylum kids an online target'. In the report a departmental spokesman is quoted as saying that unaccompanied minors are placed in permanent care arrangements by the department but:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… not placed in a permanent care arrangement by (the department) without an assessment of the suitability of that placement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department is also reported as saying that it is 'satisfied' with the current arrangements for unaccompanied minors. Yet the department is putting unaccompanied minors in risky situations. Such statements are staggering. These guardianship arrangements are unsuitable: as any parent will tell you, there is a real risk to young people from online predators. I would like Minister Bowen to explain how care arrangements for unaccompanied minors are satisfactory. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sun Herald</span> report also highlighted great concerns about the lack of targeted support and transitional arrangements for unaccompanied minors before they turn 18 as well as the need for a national framework for the care and support of such children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's border protection failures have resulted in fiscal and humanitarian disaster. Such failures tear at the fabric of Australia's social cohesion and put at risk our successful migration program. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Not that you are aware of; I thought that that would be the case. The only policy those opposite have on the complex subject of asylum seekers is to go back to their old policy. They do not recognise that, as the member for Holt said, times have changed. They do not accept that people smugglers alter their tactics to take into account government policy. It never comes into their thinking. Those opposite are all about going back. They always talk about doing something that John Howard did. As I have said previously, the Leader of the Opposition has never had an idea that John Howard did not think of first. Coalition policy is the biggest recycling program this country has ever seen. They talked about Work Choices being dead, buried and cremated. I do not know how that works, but bringing up all the policies they tried in the past is a big exhumation job. They think that all their old polices will fit circumstances now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion in the MPI debate today talks about consistency. Consistency for those opposite is all about ignoring reality and not looking at the situation as it is now. Their policies are one-size-fits-all, and the problem is that the size of the policy they are trying to fit onto today's situation fitted circumstances 10 seasons ago. But perhaps I am being unfair: they did have one new policy. I remember them hectoring us, 'Just pick up the phone and call Nauru.' Then they made a call to scope out how much it would cost to reopen the processing centre on Nauru. Who did they call? They did not call Immigration—they did not call anyone in the know about what it would cost to reopen the centre on Nauru. They called a catering company. That is the quality of the policy-making of those opposite. They used an accounting firm instead of Treasury to cost their policies in the lead-up to the 2012 election, and they used a catering company to work out how to reopen the centre on Nauru! They outsourced policy to <span style="font-style:italic;">Masterchef</span>, yet they lecture us on policy and say 'just do what we did in the past'!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have tried to break the impasse on asylum seekers by having an eminent trio of Australians, led by Angus Houston, step forward to work out what the best way forward is: what course can we take that will get us out of the political divide where there is a logjam and we are unable to move? They came up with 22 recommendations looking at the incentives which exist at the moment to people-smuggling: does the system as it is geared presently allow people to abuse the system to get here? They have tried to work out how to put in place incentives for people to use the system properly. People have the personal wealth to buy passage to Australia, and there are people profiting from their desperation by trying to get them here in vessels which are clearly unsafe and which people who are masters of the sea would never allow to be used to transport people. Things were put in place—for example, the no-advantage rule that has been steadily implemented by this government to create a disincentive for people turning to people smugglers—and there were things put in place to fix up loopholes, as has been the subject of legislation that is currently being debated in this place about unauthorised maritime arrivals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have increased the humanitarian intake. This is an interesting point because this matter of public importance calls for consistency. Now, in an effort to try and win the Greens' support in June, when the member for Lyne moved his resolution on regional processing, by all accounts a quick meeting was convened by those on the opposite side, where they agreed that they would increase the humanitarian intake. They did that—and then what happened? Last week we had the Leader of the Opposition say that he has trashed that. He is now not supporting an increase in the humanitarian intake. In fact, he will now wind it back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite lecture us on consistency when, in the space of a couple of months, they have moved away from their policy. Just to secure and meet their own political ends in this place they have done that. There is no consistency when it comes to the policies of those opposite. They say to us, for example, that they will not support the Malaysian agreement. As I said earlier today, if you were against having people detained for extended periods, if you were for people having work rights—as those opposite have advocated—and if you were for people having some access to education, you would support the Malaysia agreement quick smart. You would not support the situation as it is now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier today—I have been quite frank about it—I do not think Manus Island and Nauru will work in the longer term. I have said that previously. I have said it to the minister and I have said it publicly. I do not think it will work because it is not reflective of the situation we are in now. The situation now is that we need to remove the incentive from people smugglers to say to people, 'You'll just sit on Nauru for a bit and then you'll get here.' That is it: it is a holding pattern that they are offering to people who want to pay to get here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The longer-term decision for us is to do what the Houston report said: the next stage of offshore processing has to be Malaysia. The Houston report said that we need to move on this as quickly as possible. My argument is that this should be done as soon as possible to ensure that we are able to break this down. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite do not support it. They say it should only happen if you can find a country that has signed up to the refugee convention. They say this regardless of the fact that their tow-back policy would see people towed back to a country that is not a signatory. They say this regardless of the fact that in September they instituted a policy that would see people shipped back to Sri Lanka straight away, ignoring the refugee convention and not even giving fair consideration to their applications. The opposition would send them back to Sri Lanka, which, coincidentally, is not a signatory to the refugee convention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we are lectured on consistency by people who are, themselves, inconsistent. As I said, if you want to see a massive dent in the approach taken by people smugglers—a massive dent in the success of people smugglers—you will support Malaysia in a heartbeat. But those opposite are happy to play politics while we are trying to deal with a situation where people are drowning because they are being offered false hope. And the worst thing about this entire debate is that, we will argue, with regard to other policy issues—for example, on this whole notion of means testing—that people who have high incomes should support themselves. We talk about that. We give no regard for the people stuck in refugee camps. We are talking about people who have the money to pay for a berth to come here while other people see the best years of their lives go past while they are sitting in refugee camps. We are not looking at liberating them; we are looking at this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need to put in place every single disincentive possible to prevent people from risking their lives and risking the lives of children—and people profiting off that—and, in the process, we potentially need to give people a second chance at a new life by freeing them from refugee camps. That is consistent policy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  It is always good to follow the member for Chifley. I just let him know that there are already people being sent back to Sri Lanka. When I was on Christmas Island last week they were already going back—and they are the ones who want to work. They come to Australia and say they want to work, so they get sent back. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to support the Member for Cook on his MPI. The Member for Cook started his MPI with comments about searching for Captain Emad, along with the shadow Treasurer. It was an example of the failures of this government and its policy failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister in charge of customs, the member for Blaxland, opened his speech with the reminder of the 200 people who died off the shore of Indonesia nearly one year ago. And the member for Fraser also reminded us of the deaths at sea in 2001. I understand the minister's sentiments and I remind him that this is exactly the reason we raised this MPI. It is about saving people's lives by stopping the people smugglers and the illegal entry trade. If we, as an opposition, need to continue to remind the government of that, we will do that in every way possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also often reminded of the Prime Minister's statement when in opposition, 'Another boat; another policy failure.' Well, I say to the government that that is what you created in your scrapping of John Howard's Pacific solution in 2008—more policy failure. With the scrapping of the Pacific solution this government created a magnet for the people smugglers, and of that there can be no doubt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week marks five years since I was elected to parliament in 2007, and in those five years I have seen many examples of disastrous Labor policy failures which have hit hard in my electorate and out in the broader Australian electorate. However, none has been quite so catastrophic, as I said before, as Labor's decision to effectively repeal the Pacific solution—the border protection policy that had reduced the number of illegal boats to, effectively, zero. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Howard government left office in November 2007, there were just four people in the detention network who had arrived illegally by boat. As I said earlier, the boats were so rare that when one eventually showed up, Julia Gillard would get excited, stand up in parliament and declare 'a policy failure'. Well, Prime Minister, by your standards we have had well over 500 policy failures in border protection since you took power. The results from the reignition of the people-smuggling trade have been tragic. Over a thousand people have died at sea, a thousand souls lost because Australia cannot secure its borders from the people smugglers. This is a tragic loss and a horrible one—1,000 people have drowned on our doorstep. And the arrivals are quite simply out of control. Currently there are 2,000 people arriving every month. As the shadow minister said, that is the equivalent of the QE2 turning up at Christmas Island with a full passenger manifest every month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the fifth month in a row that more than 2,000 people have arrived illegally. And they are showing no signs of slowing down. In total, 30,000-plus have arrived under Labor and the government seems powerless to stop it. The people smugglers know that this government has lost control and, what is more, it has run out of places in detention facilities. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> last week it was revealed that, as there are no detention places left, illegal arrivals were to be fast-tracked to live in our suburbs, although without work rights. This caused plenty of concern in Western Australia, particularly in my electorate of Swan. This chaotic situation cannot be allowed to continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will repeat a story I told in parliament earlier in the year. A gentleman came up to me after a citizenship ceremony wanting to get his photo taken with his MP. When I asked which country he had come from, he said he was from Afghanistan. I asked him, 'How did you arrive here?' He said, 'By boat.' I asked: 'How did you happen to get onto the boat? How did you find the people smugglers?' He said that he did not find the people smugglers, that they came to his village offering anyone who was interested entry to Australia. I asked him, 'What did that cost you?' He said, 'US$10,000.' 'That's a fair price,' I said. 'How did you actually get here?' He said: 'We flew to Malaysia and then we got on a boat in Malaysia. We bypassed Indonesia. Before we went to Christmas Island we were told to destroy all our identification, so we did. Then I got processed and came to Australia.' 'So you beat the system?' I said. With a smile on his face, he said, 'Yes, I beat the system.' The reason I tell this story is that it shows that this is a business and nothing more—a business this government has enabled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At least 8,100 people are waiting offshore in desperate circumstances and have been denied Australia's protection via humanitarian visas over the last three years due to this boat influx. These people—the people in refugee camps, the people who don't have US$10,000-plus to pay a people smuggler—need our help most. That is the tragedy of this situation. The people of Australia welcomed a controlled immigration policy. John Howard built a consensus in favour of immigration over his time in government. It is a tragedy that humanitarian visa places are being sold on the Australian government's behalf by the people smugglers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to this matter of public importance today: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government’s inability to deliver strong, consistent and effective border protection and asylum policy over the past five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That the border protection laws have been weakened and can be deemed ineffective is indisputable. The lack of a consistent policy response means the boats keep on coming. First we had the removal of temporary protection visas and offshore processing. Then, before the last election, we had the East Timor fiasco—an incredibly embarrassing incident for Australia where the Prime Minister spoke to the wrong member of the East Timorese government. I am sure the other members on this side of the House will remember how many times we heard, before the previous election, 'We must stop the boats.' The Labor candidate for Swan repeated it over and over again. But, as yet, we have not seen it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister ditched the East Timor solution and tried a people swap arrangement with Malaysia. It did not work, and the High Court struck it down anyway. Still the boats came. Then the government defaulted to a policy of onshore processing, their previous preference, which continued to fail. During this time, the Leader of the Opposition recommended to the government 106 times that they pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and revive offshore processing as part of a three-part plan to revive the Pacific solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this advice was confirmed by the Houston panel, the Prime Minister finally acted and reversed a four-year opposition to offshore processing on Nauru. But, as the coalition has said time and time again, one policy on its own will not do it. The government needs to reinstate the proven suite of Howard policies in full—namely, TPVs, offshore processing and turning around the boats when it is safe to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said previously—from the information I have received from people in Western Australia who know what is going on—the people currently in detention centres are emailing their friends overseas to say, 'Come now before the policies are changed; come now before the coalition is re-elected.' This has been confirmed by one of the guards at the Northam detention centre. He told me that message is continually being emailed by people currently in detention centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Financially, there have been significant consequences for the taxpayer. The annual budget in 2007-08 for offshore asylum seeker management was just $85 million. The total bill for this year alone is $2.8 billion. The government's wafer-thin surplus prediction is wiped out by this alone. I can see the shadow Treasurer salivating and wishing he could get his hands on that $2.8 billion for his budgets. You can see the government trying to grab cash wherever it can, as we found out this morning with the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, just as the people smugglers do not believe the government is serious about getting tough on people smugglers, the people of Australia are under no illusions that the government will deliver on its budget surplus promise, despite it being repeated dozens and dozens of time by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The reality, as my colleague the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, has pointed out, is that the Pacific solution, when put together with temporary protection visas and turning boats back when safe, reduced the number of boat arrivals to Australia by 99 per cent and cost taxpayers only $289 million over six years. The current government has said this three-pillar solution will not work. But, in the meantime, we still see the boats coming, with many lives put at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister for customs refuted the comments by the Minister for Home Affairs that the coalition were happy to see the boats restart and continue because there was some political gain from it. I too refute those comments and have, along with other members of the coalition, continually called for this government to stop the people smuggling. This government should step up and stop this evil trade. They should keep their promise and stop the people smuggling.</span>
              </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill is intended to reunite Australians with their lost moneys faster and to protect lost moneys from inflation and fees. That is exactly what it does. The Senate Economics Committee has now considered the bill and the majority report made just one recommendation—that the bill be passed. The report found that the reforms will be of significant benefit to consumers, as they help reunite people with their unclaimed moneys sooner and protect the real value of that money while it remains unclaimed. Let me take this opportunity to make the point that the principles on which this bill is based have not changed. They are the same core principles, and it is the same piece of legislation and the same activity in terms of unclaimed and lost moneys as has been the case under previous governments, both Labor and Liberal. What we are doing is making sure it happens in a more timely fashion, ensuring that the real value of people's money is maintained and they reconnect with their money faster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is more than curious that the opposition will come into this place, move amendments and support this bill—and, in the end, they have to support this, because it is a good bill. In the end, they support the legislation; they support the principle of what is being done to assist consumers to be reunited with their lost accounts, of whatever form, whether superannuation or a life policy, a bank account or other type of account. So to delay any further would be an absolute travesty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my summing up speech, we have consulted widely. We have had consultations with industry. We have agreed that there are some areas where the intent of the amendments can be clarified to improve certainty, and these issues can and will be dealt with through regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to some of the detail of these amendments. The government amendments will provide authorised deposit-taking institutions, First Home Saver Account providers, life insurers and superannuation funds with more time for implementation. They will now have until 31 May 2013 to report on and transfer lost accounts and other lost moneys to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or the Australian tax office as appropriate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, to reflect the changing range of bank accounts available and their specific terms and conditions, the bill will also allow the government to specify additional requirements that must be met before a bank account will be treated as unclaimed moneys. This amendment will allow the government to improve certainty for industry by clarifying a number of technical issues through regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I announced yesterday, to avoid capturing accounts unintentionally the government will introduce regulations so that children's accounts will still need to be inactive for seven years before being treated as lost. In addition, regulations will specify that First Home Saver Accounts will be excluded until the requirement to make a deposit in four years has been met. The regulations will also clarify that term deposits remain excluded, and subaccounts will continue to be treated as part of a parent account when determining whether there has been activity on an account in the last three years. Linked accounts—that is, accounts that a customer must hold as a condition of holding other accounts with the same bank, building society or credit union—and mortgage offset accounts will be treated similarly. The regulations will also clarify that accounts that are frozen by a court order or other legal requirement will also be excluded while they remain frozen, and that the three-year inactivity period will restart when the freeze is lifted. The regulations will also clarify that superannuation accounts that have been active in the last 12 months but where the member is uncontactable will not be transferred to the ATO. The amendments include the ability to extend the protection from fees, charges and inflation that this bill will provide to a broader range of accounts with low balances, although, should future governments wish to do this, further disallowance regulations would need to be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and these amendments relate specifically to doing a number of core things: reuniting Australians with their lost moneys faster, and protecting the value of those moneys from inflation and fees—and this is a good thing for consumers and should have been done much earlier. Simply to have sat on the core principle, which has not changed in terms of lost money, idly for so many years— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We know that the fix is on, because this bill was introduced in a slovenly manner in the last sitting week, and the government, after initially refusing to send it to a committee, then sent it to a committee when they were forced into it. After they sent it to the committee, the committee then recommended to support the bill. The government majority recommended to support the bill. The government majority recognised that this is going to cause untold procedural damage to the financial services community, but still the Labor Party majority on the committee recommended to proceed with the bill in its form. Then what did we get yesterday? We got a press release from the government saying, 'We don't really care what our own committee recommended; we're going to come up with a whole lot of new amendments that no-one has previously seen and that have never been to a committee—</span>

You look at the front bench of the Labor Party, and it is like Davy Jones's crew on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Pearl</span>—it is exactly the same; it is a freak show. They do not know how to run the country, and they do not know how to run public policy. Whether it be on taxation, where they have no strategy, or on fiscal management, where they have no strategy, or on the basic, day-to-day duties of a legislator in this House, the Labor Party do not know how to govern.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, these amendments in particular, are the perfect illustration of the incompetence of this government. Announce in MYEFO that you have a major funding problem; surprise absolutely everyone with a grab at people's superannuation; come into the parliament with legislation that is much broader than could possibly have been anticipated in the announcement in MYEFO; screw up the legislation; send it to a committee, after initially resisting it; and then, from the committee, get a recommendation to support the bill in full but ignore it and come into this place and move a whole lot of amendments to your own bill!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the government's own parliamentary secretary here at the table, the member for Oxley, was meant to move his amendments earlier today—and he forgot to stand up. So the coalition moved their amendments in his place. And then he forgot to speak against our amendments because he was not paying attention. He is not the sharpest tool in the shed, we know that, but he forgot to speak against our amendments, and then, after he failed to speak against the amendments, you know what? He forgot to say he opposed the amendments. He forgot to call it. Then we had an imbroglio in the House, and it was put, out of deference to the Deputy Speaker, back to the House for a second vote. What mayhem! What a joke! Member for Oxley, no wonder you are consigned to a parliamentary secretary—and after doing all that work. I thought the original Ripoll committee report was pretty good on financial advice. No wonder the government ignored it, because it was a pretty good report!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then they went and completely changed it and delivered a whole lot of new amendments and FOFA legislation. Because the benchmark for this government is incompetence, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation is higher than the current Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. That is the benchmark for good government—absolute abject incompetence! But guess what? This guy is going to get a promotion! Incompetence is the benchmark for performance in the Gillard government, so we now have a parliamentary secretary who does not know what he is doing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will not support legislation that is made on the run. We will not support amendments that have not been tested in the broader community. We will not support bad and incompetent legislation and, sure as hell, we will not try to shore up an incompetent government. This is not the way the country should be run. This is not the way public policy should be run. This is not the way the parliament should be run. We deserve competent government in Australia. Sadly, we have not got it. Gerry Harvey nailed it when he said in May this year that an incompetent government is what is holding Australia back. It is not the Australian people; it is an incompetent government that just is not up to the job.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government supports constitutional change to recognise the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and we are committed to achieving this. We appointed an expert panel to develop options for constitutional change to help us work out how best to recognise Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. Now, for the first time, we have specific proposals on how to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, and I thank the expert panel members for their excellent work in developing these proposals. We are now working, through Reconciliation Australia and You Me Unity, to build a movement for change of our Constitution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In extending the time frame for a referendum, we have also set out a clear way forward and momentum to build support. This week, we will be introducing a bill for an act of recognition, acknowledging the unique and special place of our first peoples. The act will demonstrate that parliament is united on progressing constitutional recognition to show the Australian community the leadership needed for change. I am pleased that the opposition, the Greens and a number of Independents have shown their support to pass the act of recognition. Strong parliamentary support for the bill will help build momentum for change. We have proposed a sunset date of two years, setting a clear time frame to work towards the ultimate goal of constitutional recognition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To further show the parliament's desire to work together towards the goal of successful referendum, we agreed to work with the opposition to establish a joint select committee. The membership of the committee will be drawn from across the parliament. The committee will be asked to consider the bill for the act of recognition as its first task, reporting in late January next year. The committee will be then asked to continue to progress constitutional change. The recommendations of the expert panel will be the foundation of their considerations. I thank all the incoming members of the committee for their willingness to take on this very important task. We know that there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that we are able to hold a successful referendum that unites our nation. The committee will play a significant role in ensuring that this occurs. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  Achieving constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is a very significant step towards genuine and lasting reconciliation. It is a cause the coalition has long been associated with and one that we have proudly long supported. The coalition's position for over a decade has been that there should be recognition of Australia's Indigenous people in the Constitution. That is why when we were in government, in 1999, we put a proposal to the people seeking to include recognition in the preamble of the Australian Constitution. As history records, our proposal unfortunately did not succeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We again strongly advocated for such recognition during the 2007 election campaign. It would come as no surprise, therefore, that it was our proactive approach to this issue that ensured it retained the attention it so deserves. It was the Leader of the Opposition who wrote to the Prime Minister proposing that such a committee, as proposed by the motion moved by the <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs</span>, be established. We must all remain mindful that the primary objective of a constitutional referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is to achieve a unifying moment for our nation, a moment similar to that of the 1967 referendum. The work done by the expert panel, including my friend and colleague the member for Hasluck, the first Indigenous person to be elected to this House, has continued the journey of reconciliation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reconciliation is something that we believe in. It is something which we are proud to support. And it is something which we will continue to advocate. We remain of the view that constitutional recognition is a continuation of that important journey.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all members and senators for their contribution during the debates on the Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Bill 2012. In particular, I want to acknowledge the important contributions of those who are supporting this important legislation. The bill delivers on the government's commitment to introduce legislation to extend the existing transfer-of-business protections in the Fair Work Act 2009 to certain former state public sector employees who transition into the national system as a result of transfer of business. We on this side of the House do not accept that these employees should be worse off or that they should have their entitlements put at risk simply because their employer changes or as a result of an outsourcing of work or an asset sale but where their work remains the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate has passed minor amendments to the bill—which was originally considered by the House of Representatives—which were proposed by the government. Those amendments are designed to ensure that the bill clearly operates as intended and to better align the proposed provisions with the existing transfer-of-business provisions in the Fair Work Act. The amendments deal with more closely aligning Fair Work Australia's powers to make orders with those already in the Fair Work Act; further clarifying coverage of the bill to certain former state public sector employees to make clear that it does not include local government, which reflects the intended coverage and application of the bill as I announced in September; ensuring that the general protections provisions are reflected in respect of transfers under this bill; and consequential amendments which deal with cross-referencing and numbering. The amendments are designed to ensure that the legislation is as clear as possible in its scope and operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government respects the work of the 1.7 million public sector workers around Australia. We cannot stand idly by and condone public servants in some states receiving fewer protections when they transition into the national system as a result of the transfer of business than those from other jurisdictions who already have the benefit of these protections. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a>  I am pleased to address the report and to make comments on the Parliamentary Delegation to the 33rd general assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, which was held in Lombok, Indonesia, from 16 to 22 September 2012. I would like to thank at the outset the head of the delegation, Senator Singh, and the delegation secretary, Peggy Danaee. Ms Danaee did a great job of looking after the two of us, and I would say that the in-country administration is very smooth and made the delegation's work very much easier. I also thank her for this outstanding report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not continue on the administrative detail but will concentrate purely on the work of the assembly. Australia is one of a number of observer nations that have regularly participated in these ASEAN interparliamentary assemblies. In many ways, the regular and consistent participation by Australia acknowledges and provides respect to our ASEAN neighbours. Clearly, when we look at the trade, agricultural and financial interactions we have with ASEAN countries, the region is of such importance that we must engage with them at every level possible. At the diplomatic level and at the executive level we are already represented, but the parliamentary level needs to have the one-on-one collaboration that such assemblies provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from such interactions, it was also useful to closely watch the interactions between the ASEAN members. Even in the introductory speeches from delegations there was an opportunity to identify more pointed language and commentary about other members and about internal matters in other nations. It was notable that concerns about money laundering and the pursuit of a drug-free ASEAN region were also confirmed in the committee reports at the end of the conference, and Australia should take heart from this recognition. Also, it is clear that Australia should never engage in any legalisation of illicit drugs, as we do not want to distance ourselves from our near neighbours and be seen as weak in resolve in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other specific agenda item of note was the dialogue between the Australian delegation and the ASEAN representatives. It was unfortunate that control of the meeting was suboptimal, resulting in not all agenda items being covered. It was clear from the formal nature of the meeting that the need to have formal opening remarks was not made clear in our preparations in Canberra.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker, can I just ask a question of you. I was led to believe that I would get five minutes for this. Would it be possible for me, given that the time is expended, to have my speech adopted rather than delay the House any further? There is nothing of a political nature in it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ADAMS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—Today I am pleased to present the committee's report on the inquiry into the role of science for the future of fisheries and aquaculture. Australia is at the cutting edge of global initiatives to meet the needs of a growing international population. Our nation's efforts in developing innovative solutions, particularly in the sphere of sustainable fisheries management, is world renowned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's scientific capabilities in this area are led ably by a range of key organisations such as the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, the CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of these organisations use the skills and experience of highly qualified professionals, committed to ensuring long-term growth and sustainable development in an industry that, like many others, has been affected by climatic and economic factors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The world's population is growing and new ways need to be found to supply more food to feed everybody. Seafood is an excellent source of protein, and therefore needs to be a core part of future food supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our belief is that the diligent work of scientists, coupled with strong investment in science, will provide the solutions needed to deliver better quality food to more people than ever before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commencing in March this year, the committee's inquiry focused on the science of fisheries management; aquaculture research and development; biosecurity challenges; and related governance arrangements. A total of 50 submissions were received and extensive public hearings were held. These enabled the committee to discuss key issues with numerous researchers, field experts, industry representatives, environmental groups and state and federal fisheries managers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee travelled to Perth, Hobart and Townsville to conduct site inspections to see firsthand the research projects currently underway. In particular, aquaculture is rapidly moving forward with the help of science, such as identifying new species well suited to aquaculture and finding new cost-effective varieties of fish feed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found that, although Australia's fisheries management is highly regarded globally, there are some gaps in our knowledge, leading to incorrect interpretations, which has been used against the commercial fishing industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, responsibilities in Australia for fisheries management and aquaculture are complex. This is because fish do not respect state and federal boundaries—they swim across these divides and sometimes over vast areas of ocean—creating the shared responsibility for both the fish and their habitats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside day-to-day management of fisheries, there is a sizeable research and development effort taking place—with its own complexities and administrative arrangements. This effort, however, needs to be complemented with improved and standardised national reporting of fishing and aquaculture statistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Resolving governance and policy issues was another key concern of stakeholders, in particular the duplication and tensions between fisheries legislation and environmental legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notably, high-profile issues including the establishment of new marine protected areas and the arrival of the supertrawler Abel Tasman arose during the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Understandably, there was plenty of debate and discussion during the inquiry regarding the role science plays in fisheries and aquaculture and the level of precaution that the law requires to be followed when decisions are made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has made 22 recommendations overall. Firstly, the committee has recommended development of a national regional policy statement on fisheries, aquaculture and recreational fishing, which should include: (1) an overall statement of strategic intent (national fisheries policy statement) to drive future direction; (2) a new guideline on precaution; and (3) research, development and extension work program. The report also calls for day-to-day fisheries management to remain free from political direction. For too long, too many state ministers for fisheries have been making decisions about quotas within their domains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the committee has recommended that there be comprehensive national data collection and reporting in four key areas: (1) the level of investment in fisheries and aquaculture research, development and extension; (2) the status of wild fisheries stocks and ecosystems; (3) recreational fishing; and (4) fisheries and aquaculture industry activity statistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Research and Economics, ABARES, informed the committee of their intention to produce a report during 2012 similar to the annual <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orests</span> report. The committee supports this approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the committee made recommendations relating to specific issues or industry sectors, which briefly include:</span>

It identifies 22 recommendations. I can only hope, as deputy chair of this committee, that after the good work that has gone into this report it is not left lying on the shelf collecting dust like many reports have done in the past.</span>

Our practices are the envy of the rest of the world. There has been significant evidence taken that illustrates that we need to improve on our practices, and more importantly, we need to correlate what is happening on a state-by-state and territory-by-territory basis, so that we can continue to demonstrate to the rest of the world that we are good at sustainable yield and we are good at fishing practices.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  It is distressing to be here debating a bill that is similar for all intents and purposes to a step that was taken by the previous Howard government. Many of us had thought that we were no longer in an environment where we would start carving out bits of this country and saying that they did not count as properly being Australia for migration purposes. It is especially distressing because following the events that have happened this year—which everyone in this country would be aware of—where you could not fail to be moved by the tragedy of people drowning at sea as they were escaping to Australia to find a better life, we had in this parliament a unique opportunity to confront what is a difficult issue and what is a global issue; and that is the substantial movement of people around the world, and in this region, as they flee persecution, as they flee war, as flee torture and as they flee hunger. When we were presented with that opportunity, we could have had a rational debate about the kind of country that we want to be. Instead, in an environment that I have heard described as one of moral panic, where it was said that this parliament had to do something and it did not matter what it was as long as we did something, we found ourselves setting a course that would inevitably lead to bills like this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear that we have gone where perhaps the right wing of the Labor Party has always wanted to take us, because Labor, instead of taking us back to Fraser, has taken us back to Howard. That is something that is a source of distress to many people in this country. We could have had inklings of that when we saw the first proposed Malaysia solution, which the High Court and the Angus Houston panel said did not contain sufficient protections for the most vulnerable people in the world as they fled, coming here and seeking our protection. Under the conventions that we had signed up to, it was not acceptable to take the people and then dump them in another country. We saw inklings of this desire of Labor to take us back to Howard from the recent announcement that people who have come here would not be allowed to work while they have their claims processed. We now see confirmation of it in a bill that, for all intents and purposes, excises the whole of Australia from the migration zone if you happen to arrive by boat. As we head into an election year we are seeing a distressing position increasingly being taken by the government. When there is a significant decision to be made on an important social issue, faced with the choice of whether to work with the coalition or to work with the Greens and other progressives in the parliament, the government is increasingly choosing to work with the coalition. We saw it recently on the Murray-Darling issue, and we are seeing it on the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been much talk about what alternatives we might have been able to come up with as a parliament—and there are many. But to have an alternative you need to shift your position and be willing to compromise. There was one fundamental issue on which the government was unwilling to compromise, and that was offshore processing: if someone finds their way here by boat after having escaped war, perhaps—after having fled, perhaps, halfway across the globe—then we want to take them to another country or an island; we do not want to process them here; we want to remove them from Australia, whether they are man, woman or child, and potentially lock them up indefinitely. That fundamental point was why the government chose to go and work with the coalition—and of course found a willing partner there. There is a road map for all of this, and that road map was set out by the Howard government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us just consider for a moment someone who finds themselves in such a desperate situation that they will pay someone they have never met some money to get into a boat. This person may have been waiting in the camp in Indonesia, on our doorstep, for a number of years. There are over 8,000 people waiting there, with over 1,000 of them having been found to be refugees, but with no clear pathway out, and with Australia having taken only 50 or 100-odd people from the camp in the last year or two. If I were sitting in that camp, especially if I had been found to be a refugee, and I had seen others sitting near me waiting for years and years, and I did not see a pathway out, and someone came along and said, 'Give us a bit of money and I'll pop you on a boat and you'll get to Australia', well, I would do it. And I reckon anyone here would do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are we doing with those people who come here? We are now putting them in a legal limbo. We are now saying to those people, who had no other clear pathway out, 'You are being put in legal limbo, because when you land you do not actually land in Australia; we reserve the right to now send you off somewhere else for an indefinite period of time.' The worst thing about this is that if the intention is to stop the boats—and I will come back to that in a moment—it will not work. We saw, under the Howard government, one of the biggest single maritime disasters, with 353 people dying at sea, at a time when offshore processing and the Pacific solution was at its height and in full force. And why is that? It is because unless Australia becomes as bad as Afghanistan under the Taliban, or unless Australia starts torturing its citizens, we are always going to be a better bet for people. And we are never going to become that bad, so people around the world, as they look for a safe haven, are always going to look to places like Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have signed up to the UN refugee convention and said that if people come here then we will look after and process them. If they are not found to be genuine refugees, we send them back; if they are, we find a way of helping them. We are not doing that for these people for whom we say we are going to insist on offshore processing. We will fail morally if we pass this bill, because we have not provided them with a safer alternative pathway. It is all well and good to talk about the no-advantage test. But really—morally—the only way you can say that that is a defensible proposal is if there is safe and quick pathway to come here other than by boat. If you are waiting in Indonesia or Malaysia the average processing time for you can be anything from four years upwards. If you want to take a mathematical average of the time in Malaysia, depending on the category you are in, it could be six or seven years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an obligation—and this is what we could have done—to say, 'We will stop people drowning at sea by removing the risk and the incentive for them to get on a boat by providing safer pathways for coming to Australia.' We could have said—and this is what the Greens have been consistently proposing, even though others have sought to diminish our position as being simply about onshore processing—that if you start to take 1,000 people from the camps in Indonesia and beef up the processing we have there, whether through UNHCR or through Australia operating its own processing centre in Indonesia, and you do the same in Malaysia and increase our humanitarian intake, then all of a sudden the message that starts to go through those camps will be that Australia is taking people again. The message is that, if you are a genuine refugee and you wait your turn for long enough, you will find yourself either in Australia or being resettled somewhere else, so there is no point in getting on a boat. That is what almost all the experts who fronted up to the Houston inquiry, and who have spoken out since, have said is the answer. The people who are working on the ground in the camps in Indonesia and in Malaysia have said that the best thing you can do is give people in the camps hope that if they wait long enough they will find their way out to Australia. At the moment, there is no hope there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is lots of talk about the people smugglers' business model. The people smugglers' business model is based on the desperation and the lack of hope that people who are languishing in these camps feel. They feel that there is no other alternative. If we were serious—if this debate was really about saving the lives of refugees—we would have provided them with safer pathways. We have not done that at all. That is because this debate is about two old parties trying to out-tough each other. It is about the right wing of the Labor Party saying, 'When faced with a choice, we would rather go and work with the coalition than work with the Greens or the crossbenchers to find a solution.' Now we find ourselves in a situation in which history is repeating. Instead of going back to Malcolm Fraser, we have gone back to John Howard. The most disappointing thing about it is that there is a better side to Australians. In the years after the Vietnam War, we took in between 90,000 and 100,000 people from Vietnam. We saw them coming in boats. We saw the tragedy that that involved and we said that we needed a regional solution that involved looking after these people and taking our fair share. It was by no means pretty or necessarily the most humane thing. It was a very distressing time for very many people. And it involved people being held in processing centres for a while.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we did not do when they arrived here on boats was turn them around. What we did not do was say, 'You've made your way here by boat, so we're going to take you to another country and let them look after you.' Instead, we said to the whole country and to the refugees: 'This is a problem. We've played a role in it. There are people coming here after fleeing a war'—and we should recognise that echo with the people who are coming here after Afghanistan—'and we will come up with a solution that is not only going to stop you getting so desperate that you'll jump on a boat but that will be humane. We will not need to suspend our obligations under the refugee convention and we will certainly not need to say that the whole of Australia does not count as Australia if you arrive here by boat.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you ask people in this country whether or not it was a good thing that we did that, most will tell you that it was. Everyone can tell you the story of someone they know in their family, in their workplace or in their street who came here as a refugee and who has now made this country a better place by virtue of being here. There is a better side to each and all of us as citizens of this country. The choice for the leadership of the government is this: which side are they going to pander to? Are they going to pander to the worst in us, the most fearful in us, and embark on a battle that they can never win, which is to try and out-tough Tony Abbott on this question? Or are they going to say, 'No matter what kinds of walls we put up around this country, because we are a democracy people are always going to come here, so the question is how to manage it, not how to try and win votes out of it in outer suburban marginal electorates in New South Wales or Queensland'? The question should be: how do we make Australia better? I reckon if you asked people most would tell you that they would be up for that challenge. But it requires leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not seen that leadership and as a result we find ourselves here yet again deciding that we are going to provide differential treatment and have different classes of people. If you had happened to have found your way here by boat 30 years ago, you would have been welcomed and made a part of Australia and would now be one of those people running a business, in a leadership position, in a parliament somewhere in this country or an archbishop. But now we are saying: 'Potentially you will find yourself on a prison island or somewhere else if the government approves that. You will be held for an indefinite period of time. We don't care what mental health consequences that is going to have for you. You are there as an example to be a deterrent for others.' That is not the kind of country that I want and it is not the kind of country that many other people here want either.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RANDALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. We would not be here tonight debating this at all if this Rudd-Gillard government had not have changed the policies in 2007. We had policies that worked. People have said this many times, but it has to be said again: when the Rudd government took over in 2007, there were four people who had arrived by boat in detention. The policies worked. No matter how you spin it and no matter how you play with it, at the end of the day the changing of the policies that the member for Berowra put in, which included temporary protection visas, the offshore Pacific solution and the turning back of boats where it was safe to do so, worked. The number of people coming by boat dried up to a trickle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the history of this. I was in the parliament at the time when John Howard brought in these measures—the Tampa solution. I was elected in that year, 2001, so I remember it well. People wanted us to do something about this, and we did. It sent a very strong signal to people smugglers that we were not open for business. Unbelievably, the Rudd Labor government made a great fanfare of dismantling that policy. Western Australian Senator Chris Evans was the immigration minister at the time. I felt pretty cheated by the way he gloated at what he did to a successful policy. I will be reminding my electorate in Western Australia of the role of Senate Evans in this come the next election, because they need to know who was responsible for the dismantling of a successful government policy that saved this country a lot of money and saved a lot of lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Evans gloated about dismantling not only the solution but the camps at Manus Island and Nauru. When this new solution was taken on by the Gillard government, they complained that the camp on Nauru had fallen into disrepair and was derelict. They talked in the same manner about Manus Island. The minister at the time, Senator Evans, should be castigated for having bragged about destroying government property or being a barracker for those who destroyed government property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eventually the message filtered through to the people smugglers that Australia was open for business again. This government saw a sudden and exponential increase in the numbers of people deciding to take the risky journey to Australia. I speak about this with a little bit of authority, because I have been to Afghanistan and seen the people there who want to come to Australia by any means. I have been to Sri Lanka recently and I met with those detained by the Sri Lankan navy and talked with them about their reasons for coming. And I can tell you, in Sri Lanka, not one person that I spoke to said they were coming here for humanitarian reasons—not one person. They said they were coming here because they knew they could get a good job and there was a lot of money in Australia. When I told them they would not get a visa they said to me, 'It doesn't matter; we'll try, and we'll try again.' Interestingly, the minister, who is at the table, probably does not want to be aware of this, but the money that they get to go home is worth about three years' salary to many Sri Lankans, particularly in the north. It is not much of a deterrent: $16 a week is what the guy serving me in Jaffna told me he earns. So it is not a bad lure to come here and be sent home with your three years' salary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's get back onto this disgraceful backflip, as it has been described by everybody who has been speaking on this bill—even the Greens member, Adam Bandt, from Melbourne. This hypocrisy knows no bounds. At least the member for Melbourne is consistent. I do not agree with the Greens' policies—I think they are pretty whacky and out of touch with the reality of the Australian electorate, who want to see an orderly migration system, not the one that the Greens want where they say, 'We need to better facilitate their entry into Australia.' Unless you vote Greens, you just do not ascribe to that strange logic about getting people here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in the parliament in 2006 when we were vilified, up hill and down dale, by everyone possible in this place, when John Howard wanted to do what this bill wants to do—that is, essentially excise Australia from being a migration zone. We first talked about the islands around Australia. Oh, shock horror! People said it was unconstitutional, it was un-Australian; and now the current government, as we did in 2006, suddenly, because it was recommended by the three members of their advisory panel, have decided to have a go at this. But let us just remember: they vilified us as well about the Pacific solution. They had to contract out their advice, and they got the Houston committee to then tell them, 'Yes, you should try Manus Island and Nauru'—too late; they are coming in their droves. You cannot build a camp big enough to accommodate the thousands of people who are coming per month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has happened? Australia is full. Inverbrackie is full. Curtin is full. Northam is full. Leonora is full. They are opening up the centre at Tasmania. What is the next solution? 'Well, we tried to get people to take them as billets, and we wanted to pay them so much a week'—so all these poor ladies around Australia were happy to try and earn a quid by billeting a few refugees while they waited. That has not worked; it has not really cut through or taken off. So what are we going to do? We are going to let them come here, but, because there are so many of them, they can now get a bridging visa to stay in Australia but they cannot work. As I said, I remember the hypocrisy of what they were saying when we did what we did—and it worked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been said, but I have to remind you: it was not only people like Senator Evans, and, of course, the minister at the table, Minister Bowen, who said that this was a 'dark stain on the character of Australia'—these people are not consistent. As I said, at least the Greens are consistent. We are consistent. The only inconsistent ones in this debate are the Labor Party, because they have had so many incarnations and conversions on the way to the Pacific solution—not on the road to Damascus, I can tell you; it is on the road to Nauru and Manus Island—that no-one believes them anymore. People came up to me when I hosted Tony Abbott in my electorate last week and they were saying to us, 'Are you certain you can stop this situation?' And we said, 'Yes, because we've done it before, and it works.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Berowra in this place say that, when he brought in these measures, he did not know which would work the best of the suite of three measures, but he said that, when you put them all together, they worked. Unfortunately, this government has only got one real part of that suite, one leg of the three-legged stool—and that is the Pacific solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Temporary protection visas, which Tony Abbott wants to move a private members' bill on, will test the government to see if they are real in wanting to give a further deterrent. Because, as we know, and you have to explain to people in the electorate—which I do—temporary protection visas allow people to come here and, while their status is being determined as to whether they are genuine refugees or their countries are safe enough to return to, they can have some work rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I tell you what is cutting through to the electorate also—Tony Abbott's enunciation of the fact that we should be allowing these people to be receiving Work for the Dole type payments, because people do not want those arriving here without a legal reason to do so getting on our welfare system. We know that this measure allows them to earn 89 per cent of Newstart. So there you are: you have people in my electorate who are doing it really hard, and I tell you what makes them really angry—and I would be pleased if the minister at the table would listen to some of these. I have people ringing up my electorate office, or emailing me on a daily basis, who are  trying to get here legitimately. A gentleman from the Boddington Gold Mine emailed me today. He has a good job, he pays a lot of tax—about $40,000 a year—he has married an overseas lady, who is pregnant, and he is having real problems getting her to Australia before the birth of the child. And then they see the fact that, if you turn up by boat, you can come straight in and live in the burbs and probably get a house out of it as well. That is what makes them really cross. The number of migration issues that come through my office from people legitimately trying to come here and bring their families, or to reunite or to bring their skills here—it is disgraceful. And yet they see thousands of people coming—30,000 since the government have been in office; 8,000 since they introduced their version of the Pacific solution. And they try to get one member of their family in. No wonder they are so cross and upset with the way the government are treating our immigration policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But going back to all of those who wanted to vilify us on this issue—the minister at the table has probably had his ears belted all day—there were right-wingers like the member for Watson, Tony Burke, saying, 'Australia is better than this bill,' 'The legislation before us today undermines our sovereignty,' 'It is offensive to our decency,' and, 'It makes a mockery of this parliament,' The member for Hotham said, 'Labor opposes it outright,' 'There is nothing you can do to this excision bill that will fix it,' 'We will not seek to amend it; we will oppose it in its entirety,' and, 'This bill is shameful and xenophobic.' What happened six years later? 'We are remade, morphed, reborn; we have a different view—we turned 180 degrees. We don't believe in anything we believed in before.' It is just woeful. Of course, we are not going to oppose the bill, because it is the bill we brought to this parliament six years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be interested to see what some of the members of the Labor Party do if this comes to a vote—though it will probably be a mickey because we are supporting it. The member for Fremantle has been very outspoken on what a disgraceful set of measures these are, yet I imagine that, if it does come to a vote, she will vote for these measures. She tried to say before that she did not vote for them because there was a mickey, but she did not cross the floor and join those on the mickey vote. She told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fremantle Herald</span>, when I wrote to her newspaper, that she supported these measures, after saying she could not, would not and did not vote for them. The only reason she did not vote was that it was a mickey vote. I will be pointing this out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fremantle Herald</span> when this vote comes up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorates of other left-wing members of this parliament should know their duplicity on this issue as well. In 2006, the Leader of the House, when the parliament was debating the legislation last time, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today this parliament is debating a bill that reduces us as a parliament and as a nation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG THOMSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  This is not an easy issue for governments to deal with. It is not an easy issue for the community to deal with. It is a difficult question where time changes the way in which solutions should be looked at. There was a time when people would come to a parliament like this and argue that the White Australia policy was right. People changed their minds about that. Old policies were changed and new policies were adopted. So I understand that views that people may have had in the past have changed as circumstances have changed, but I do not agree with these changes. Obviously, while my politics are left of centre, they are not 'in the Left', and the characterisation by the previous speaker of people's views as fitting a particular grouping is simply not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My approach to policy has always been that we allow the markets to dictate what happens unless there is market failure. Can there have been a greater market failure than what has occurred with close to 40 million people seeking asylum around the world and not having a permanent place to live? There simply cannot be a greater issue that requires governments to act against the way in which society has broken down in some countries and left such large numbers, almost twice the population of Australia, looking for a permanent home because either their existing home is no longer safe or they have been kicked out and are no longer able to stay there. So I do not approach this necessarily with just a bleeding heart; I approach this matter in the same way that I approach every matter, and that is from the point of view of an absolute market failure and the question of how we deal with it. In that context, it is completely understandable that governments may change their minds on issues, but in this case they have done so wrongly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were two main reasons that I chose to enter parliament. One was to make sure we got rid of Work Choices and the terrible effects that was having on families, particularly families that commute a lot, as they do on the Central Coast. The second reason was the way in which we treat those people who are less fortunate than us but may not have been born in this country. I was concerned with how we deal with them in a humane way that does not affect the integrity of Australia's borders or make Australia a less secure place. So I am particularly disappointed. I understand the government is searching in a very difficult situation for a solution, but I am very disappointed that they have taken the step of supporting something that they quite rightly rejected in 2006.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very honest about this. It is just a tricky technical nonsense to actually say that Australia is not part of Australia for the purpose of people seeking asylum. But it is even more tricky than that because it is only not Australia if you have come by boat. And it is even more tricky than that, because if you get on a P&amp;O cruise liner in Fiji and then come to Sydney Harbour and seek asylum, again, you are not affected by this legislation. So the government has picked a particularly inhumane and tricky way of trying to deal with what is a major global problem that requires not short-term political point scoring but long-term solutions that are going to make sure that the people who are in most need are looked after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand the pressure on the government when you have an opposition that has its head in the sand about these issues and will continually look at pointscoring rather than at positive solutions to this. I listened to the member for Melbourne's contribution and I think the Greens have also failed in this area. They had the opportunity to support the government in talking about regional processing and looking at solutions that go beyond one country. They failed in relation to that and they cannot come in here and say that what they are doing is right. They played the politics of this as well. So we have all parties playing politics with people's lives and ignoring the facts that are there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not one of the most generous refugee intake countries in the world—we hear the opposite all the time, but it is simply not true. We are the 14th largest economy yet we accept 0.03 per cent of the world's refugees. I have heard other contributors, including the member for Melbourne, talk about what Australia did in the aftermath of Vietnam. We were accepting about six per cent of world refugees at that time. We are now taking in 0.03 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other points that has been made—and both parties have made a lot of it—is that stopping the boats will save lives. Well, cutting off someone's last line of escape is no great favour. If you are killed by the Taliban you are just as dead as if you drown. People who are making this very difficult decision about getting on a boat are not doing it for any other reason than that this is their last hope. The argument is often put—and the member for Canning was trying to make this point—that the boat arrivals are not genuine refugees, they are here for economic reasons. That is simply just not true, and it does not hold out in terms of the acceptance of asylum seekers, ultimately, when their claims are processed. If you are looking at where the non-genuine overstayers are then it is clearly plane arrivals. Only between 20 to 40 per cent of plane arrivals who seek asylum in this country are successful. Compare that with the 85 to 90 per cent of people who arrive by boats; clearly, the argument that people are getting on boats to seek some economic advantage just cannot be made out. They are coming because they are desperate, and 85 to 90 per cent of them are successful in having their claims met. They are indeed genuine asylum seekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument is also put that these people are queue jumpers. Can I say that with close to 40 million seeking asylum in the world it is a terribly long queue. If there were a queue to join, it would take you 135 years to work your way through that queue before you were processed here. So that whole argument is absolute nonsense. It is a cover for people who are racist. That is simply what it is and it has to be said that that is what it is. People who say that there is a queue are actually saying, 'We do not want these people coming here. We do not care about what their circumstances are. We simply do not want them in this country. That is it.' That is a much more honest position to put. We hear, particularly from the coalition, people talking about hypocrisy and so forth. Well, put your argument that you do not want foreigners per se coming to this country, because there is no queue, and if there were one it would take 135 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at how someone from, say, Afghanistan would seek asylum in Australia. The argument would probably be that they would go to the Australian embassy to seek asylum. But the address of the Australian embassy is, for security reasons, quite clearly and obviously kept secret. So there is nowhere to go in Afghanistan if you want to seek asylum in Australia. It is an absolute nonsense that there is some queue that people can go to and line up in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of the issues that have been raised as to why we should not be taking people. I actually think that the minister in 2006 made a very good speech, and I know it has been quoted a lot. What he said in 2006 holds just as much now as it did then. He started by saying that in 1951 the United Nations Convention for the Protection of Refugees came into force. The world realised the mistakes of the 1930s, when many western nations turned their backs on Jews fleeing persecution in Germany. Collectively, we said, 'Never again.' I am sure that all of us involved in public life would like to think that we would have done the right thing in those circumstances and stood up for those facing the worst of circumstances, regardless of whether it was popular or unpopular. He went on to talk about the then Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, saying that if it passes parliament 'it will be the day that Australia turned its back on the refugee convention and on refugees escaping circumstances that most of us can only imagine'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill. If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character. The people who will be disadvantaged by this bill are in fear of their lives, and we should never turn our back on them. They are people who could make a real contribution to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was true six years ago and it is equally true now. The government find themselves reacting to the politics and they need to be above that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent the electorate of Dobell. The only time a Labor member lost the seat was in 2001, at the Tampa election. At that particular election there were big posters right around the electorate saying, 'We choose who comes to this country.' We were all saying what a terrible thing that was, yet here we are trying to reproduce almost exactly the same type of legislation—reacting to the same things that happened then. The government are doing it for political reasons. They think that if they are tough in relation to this area they will be rewarded at an election. They are simply ignoring history if they believe that. In 2001 we lost Dobell. We lost some seats even though the approach of the Labor Party at that time was to say: 'We will do everything that Prime Minister John Howard is saying. We support it all. We are not disagreeing with it.' We were trying to make sure there was no difference between us. The Labor Party have clearly not learnt their lesson. They have not learnt their political lesson and they need to get their moral compass back on track in relation to these issues. They did after a period of time in opposition. By 2006, they were fine, looking at these issues in a rational way. They are reacting to very difficult circumstances. They are reacting to a public policy issue that is not easy and does not have a magic bullet solution, but most of all they are reacting to the political bait that is being put by the opposition. It is wrong morally and it is wrong electorally for the Labor Party to go down this path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have thought a lot about what I am going to do in this. I will be opposing this legislation. I have thought a lot about it because of the way in which people in my electorate voted in 2001. Do you know what? Sometimes you have to do what is right. Chris Bowen, the minister, as the member for Prospect back in 2006, said, 'You've got to take a decision, even if it will be unpopular, as long as you're sure that it's right.' It is right that this bill is defeated. Australia is Australia. We cannot play tricky word games and try to pretend it is something it is not. We hold ourselves out to be part of the world community. We need to show that we are mature enough to take responsibility on a range of these issues and we should reject this bill wholeheartedly.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  As a dear friend of mine often says, prefacing remarks in a political conversation: 'To know where we are today, we have to go back to where we began.' We began with the Australian community's outrage over women and children, and thousands of others, detained behind razor wire, languishing on temporary protection visas in a land where the liberty, freedom and the rule of law are a given, and taken for granted. This bill is yet another step to take us back full circle to a place of national shame. It directly offends the tenet, values and arrangements negotiated by me and others which were passed into law by the Howard government in 2004, then tested and reaffirmed under a set of different circumstances in 2006. That agreement went to the heart of protecting the most vulnerable individuals from life behind a razor-wire fence. It went to the heart of how we treat genuine refugees seeking solace within our shores. The wrongs that were righted removed a disgrace. This proposal is a disgrace and it bring disgrace upon us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand today more in sorrow than in anger. With injustice and indifference at its core, this proposal to excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone resurrects the legislation proposed in 2006 by the then Howard government. I opposed it then; I oppose it now. If this were not of such a serious nature I would have thought it were a joke. This legislation joins Tasmania with Christmas Island, 5,399 kilometres apart! Though we differ, my party has been entirely consistent in support of this policy position under the leadership of John Howard, Brendon Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott. In stark contrast, other members of this House called the 2006 genesis of this bill as being immoral and xenophobic. They were right then. This policy reversal is wrong now. Today, these same representatives sit as members of executive government, parroting their predecessor's policy disgrace. That our leadership—and I am talking about both parties—has come to an enabling consensus on this matter is not a display of unity and bipartisanship; rather, it is a retreat from leading the national debate to a higher place for a greater purpose. I said in 2006 that my decision then to oppose similar legislation was made because it was in the national interest of this Great South Land that it continue to be a passionate protector of the rights of genuine refugees. My position is unchanged today for the sake of our national interests both at home and abroad. I oppose this legislation now as I did its predecessor because it is offends the stand—and it seems today that these words were spoken so long ago—I made in 2006, when I said that Australia should remain:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand tonight in a place of discomfort and controversy in a debate that is complicated, divisive and polarising. In this moment I can choose to be either at peace with my party, unified in opposition to this poor excuse for a Labor government or at peace with my heart for this nation. I choose to be at peace with my heart for this nation. I oppose these Labor Party bills and all who join with them in their intent to enact unjust laws which while they are on our statutes will remain a blight on our national integrity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  Today is a rare day for the government. Today this government is doing something which makes sense, which has a chance of working, which might restore some integrity to Australia's borders and which might act as a deterrent to the repugnant trade of people smugglers who traffic in human misery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is to expand the existing offshore processing regime to apply to all persons who arrive unlawfully by sea to mainland Australia. You could be forgiven for thinking that the objective of this bill sounds familiar. That would be because it is familiar. This bill is almost a carbon copy of the bill passed by the House of Representatives under the Howard government in 2006 when it expanded offshore processing to apply to people arriving on mainland Australia. How embarrassing it must be for the government to introduce this bill into the House. Maybe the answer to the question of why the government is doing so lies in the difference between what the now Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, is saying now and what he had to say back in 2006 when he, along with his Labor colleagues, opposed the Howard government's introduction of the almost-identical bill. The now minister described that bill then as a 'stain on our national character'. But what is he saying today? Ms Ellis, who is now also a minister, said that the bill was 'ludicrous', 'harsh', 'inhumane' and 'gutless'—and it went on and on. The hypocrisy of the government's U-turn is absolutely breathtaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragic and unacceptable loss of life and unprecedented budgetary disaster have flowed from Labor's staggeringly incompetent border protection policies. Labor's border protection policies should be likened to an employment program for people smugglers. The Howard government put the people smugglers out of business; Labor resurrected their business. Since November 2007, when Labor announced that it was dismantling the coalition's border protection polices, there have been 30,000 unauthorised maritime arrivals. This is more people than live in cities such as Alice Springs, Warrnambool, Nowra, Albany, Maryborough and Devonport. It is about 1½ times the number of people who live in cities such as Goulburn, Armidale, Whyalla and Mount Isa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since November 2007, Labor's failures on our borders have got worse. The government's policies have been half-hearted, and it has made policy switches from one month to the next. The government is not up to the job, and it is not up to the commitments that it has made. More than half the number—that is, 15,403—of the 30,057 unauthorised maritime arrivals under this government have turned up this year, and more than a third—that is, 10,146—have turned up since 1 July. More people have turned up on more boats in 2012 alone than in the entire 11½ years of the Howard government yet Labor still refuses to acknowledge that it got it horribly wrong when it abolished the Howard government's policies, and it continues to get it wrong by refusing to restore them. This is what happens when intractable political incompetence blinds sensible decision making. Sadly, this dynamic occurs all too often in this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the average rate of arrivals over the full term of the Howard Government, it would have taken John Howard more than 25 years as Prime Minister to reach the number of unauthorised maritime arrivals that have occurred under Labor in less than five years. Under the Howard government's policies, it would have taken more than 500 years to reach 30,000 unauthorised maritime arrivals. Labor's record on border protection shows breathtaking incompetence. It reads as follows. Since the last election, Labor's failures on our borders have increased threefold: in Labor's first term there were 7,349 illegal boat arrivals; so far in Labor's second term there have been more than 22,000. The average monthly rate of arrivals over Labor's second term is almost four times higher—and at current levels it is 10 times higher—than it was in Labor's first term. Absolutely tragically, under Labor's policies more than 1,000 people have perished at sea. At least 8,100 people who have been waiting offshore in desperate circumstances have been denied Australia's protection because they did not come on a boat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Dobell expressing an interesting slant on border protection policy. He said that there is no such thing as people waiting in queues and no such thing as a United Nations humanitarian refugee waiting list. But I have been to refugee camps. I have spoken to people who have been interviewed. I have been to the Thai-Burmese border and seen the 140,000 people there who are waiting offshore and who are applying under the correct processes to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Also, the budget has blown out. It has blown out to $6.6 billion and counting, including $1.7 billion this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government's policy has done incredible damage to Australia's humanitarian and immigration programs. It has been a public policy disaster in humanitarian terms and also in budgetary terms. There is no other way to describe it. This will put an incredible pressure on public housing. There are agencies like the Red Cross and others who are doing an incredible job, but these numbers keep rising. There will be incredible pressures put on state governments in terms of health and education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will replace the concept of 'offshore entry person' with the concept of 'unauthorised maritime arrival'. It will mean that more persons who arrive on Australian soil by boat will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and they will be processed according to that country's regime. What this means is that the bill will effectively excise the Australian mainland from the Migration Act, which is intended to be a disincentive for people to make the journey to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor continues to fail to implement the full suite of measures the coalition had in place. Every day, when they say they will bring out a policy, they keep retreating. Today we saw a retreat, again, on work rights. They were not going to introduce work rights; now they are softening on work rights with the temporary protection visa update and changes that they announced a few days ago. This policy keeps evolving and changing; no wonder people smugglers continue to send people here; they have absolutely no surety about what the government is going to say from one policy decision to the next, or what they are going to stick to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has continued to change its policy from day to day. We introduced these measures in 2006. The impact of these measures would have been much more significant if this government had introduced the full suite of measures. This bill is a step in the right direction and the coalition will support it. The challenge for the Labor Party now is to embrace the complete policy and political honesty, adopt the remainder of the coalition's border protection policies and put people smugglers out of business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But do not hold your breath for that one, Deputy Speaker. That is too much policy logic from Labor, and after five years of policy failure it is probably expecting a bit too much.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  Before I speak to the bill I would like to acknowledge in this chamber the very courageous and wise words of the member for McMillan. I feel privileged indeed to count him as a friend and to have him as a colleague in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 gives effect to recommendation 14 of the Houston expert panel, which proposed excising the Australian mainland so that a person arriving by sea, without a visa, cannot apply for a protection or other visa unless the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship determines that it is in the public interest to lift that restriction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The practice of excising parts of Australian territory started in 2001, and a bill to expand the excision of the Australian mainland was introduced and passed in the House of Representatives in 2006. As my colleague said, he and I and other colleagues, the former member for Cook, who is somewhere in the gallery, and the former member for Kooyong, opposed that bill at that time. But so concerning were the measures outlined in that bill that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, chaired by then government Senator Marise Payne, recommended that 'the bill not proceed'. It was withdrawn when it was clear it would not pass the Senate—not because of the terrible ramifications of that piece of legislation, but because it simply was not going to pass in the Senate, and that would have been an embarrassment to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report included a number of recommendations to limit the effects of the bill should the government still elect to introduce it. These were fairly extensive but went to transparency, procedural fairness, special consideration for women and children, parliamentary and/or ombudsman scrutiny of operations on Nauru and Manus Island and a sunset period of 18 months for the operation of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before the House has the same intent. It effectively warehouses people in a foreign country and continues a pattern of punitive, arbitrary, indefinite, mandatory detention. These are people: men, women and children who have not been convicted of any crime. May I say, that in looking at these issues over a lengthy time line—I think it has been a 10-year period—there has been more than one inquiry a year into the effects of mandatory detention, and all of them have warned government of the dire consequences of this policy. Yet governments of both persuasions have ignored all of those reports—some of them from their own parliamentary committees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What really concerns me is that this legislation places these people out of reach of the Australian legal system and casts doubts as to whether any review process will ever be available to them. Our democracy is underpinned by the rule of law, which requires, as a minimum, access to judicial review of administrative action, the right to a fair trial, the right to private communication with a lawyer and access to the courts. This bill is a crack in each of those foundation stones of our democracy. That is why people out there ought to be concerned about the passage of such legislation in unseemly haste in this place. We should ask the question: who or what will protect these people from processing errors? Who or what?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In justifying these extreme measures, the expert panel report provided just two paragraphs of reasoning for such a draconian piece of legislation. On the statistics alone, it is difficult to justify the excision of the whole mainland. In the decade since 2001, a total of five boats have managed to get as far as the Australian mainland—and those five boats carried only 86 people. This is not an avalanche, a tsunami or an invasion. It is hardly a number to give rise to the implementation of such an extreme piece of legislation—a piece of legislation which discriminates against an asylum seeker simply on the basis of the mode of travel they used to come to this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we continue along this path, with this bill being the final legal brick in the creation of fortress Australia. Let us be clear: Australia has signed the refugee convention, but it seems the government has no intention of meeting its obligations under that agreement. This bill, combined with the recently passed Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill, the existing legal framework, the memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru and Papua New Guinea, and the new no-advantage test, completes a cunning suite of legislation and international agreements devised by government to effectively avoid Australia's obligations under the refugee convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I read a wonderful article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span> this morning. It was by Professor William Maley from ANU and Penelope Mathew and was entitled 'Bowen's asylum line is illegal.' They note:</span>
                </p>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">commitments to other states. If it were to dishonour those commitments, it could hardly expect to be taken seriously if it then complained when other states chose to dishonour their commitments under a whole range of treaties and conventions from which Australians stand to benefit</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The article was worth reading in its entirety and I had a conversation just this afternoon with William Maley on these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this new regime, asylum seekers will, at the very least, spend years languishing in detention in foreign countries even if they have been assessed as a refugee, and they may never be able to successfully apply for asylum in Australia. A dissection of the suite of measures uncovers the devil in the detail. Take, for instance, Nauru. The MOU states that refugees will be processed under Nauruan law. This is confirmed by Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship in material given to asylum seekers. But, to apply for an Australian refugee visa under regulation 866.21 of the Australian Migration Act regulations, the applicant must be a person to whom 'Australia has protection obligations under the Refugee Convention.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an incredible sleight of hand. It is difficult to see how any asylum seeker can argue Australia's protection obligations are applicable when they are determined to be a refugee in Nauru, under Nauruan law, which is now a signatory to the refugee convention. When I speak to lawyers, it is clear that they can barely understand the complexities in this suite of legislation. Consider the consequences for just one moment. We have shovelled off these desperate people to a country which simply cannot absorb or resettle them, in the process potentially extinguishing any legal claim they have to resettle in Australia. They will, as a result of the government's deliberate policy choice, languish in detention centres offshore for years at Australian taxpayer expense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear speeches in this place about the huge cost of our asylum program. We could avoid that by treating these people decently, resettling them quickly and processing their claims quickly and efficiently. I will not go into that right now, but there is no justification for the huge expense to Australian taxpayers of this flawed policy. We need to ask ourselves what value we place on the rule of law if we are prepared to extinguish it for a political purpose. There can be no other reason for the sweeping changes in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider, for instance, the fact that, from 1 July 1998 to 27 July 2012, there were 79,498 protection visa applications from people who arrived in Australia by air. This is more than double the total number of people arriving by boat over the same period and it is 924 times more people than have arrived on the Australian mainland. Yet this bill will not affect air arrivals. These people, some of whom arrive in Australia with no intention of returning to their country of origin, will not be removed to an overseas detention facility. They will have access to merits review and will live and work in the community despite the fact that, statistically, only about 20 per cent to 30 per cent of them qualify for refugee status. That compares to 90 per cent of the people who arrive by boat qualify. How can this glaring difference in the way people are treated be justified? Why do we continue to demonise and penalise people who arrive by boat? It is difficult to accept the argument that Australia's approach of stripping away the protections contained in an international convention designed to protect human dignity and respect for human life should have any legal or moral force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing this issue requires more than tag lines. We must engage in a constructive regional dialogue and must first work to find durable policies in the source countries. We must use diplomacy and work with our neighbours in the region to address the common concerns about refugee flows, not just to resolve the political problems in Australia but to seek cohesive, humane policy for the region. This should include consultation with countries in the region to seek agreement to set up UNHCR approved regional processing centres and it should include a commitment by Australia to lift its refugee intake to a more realistic level. Under this process, people could not pick and choose a country to resettle in but would be allocated, as has been done successfully in the past, during the Indochinese conflict for example. I know that was slightly different, but there is no reason why this cannot be achieved. It is harder, it is slower but it is more sure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps also it is time to discuss with the UNHCR the renegotiation of our humanitarian intake so we can relieve some of the pressures in the region, be good neighbours and take the bulk of our humanitarian intake from the immediate region, where the problem currently exists. These are matters worthy of discussion if we really want to stop people losing their lives crossing the ocean between Indonesia and Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will not be a quick political fix that resolves these matters. Rather, it will be the intelligent, diligent application of diplomatic skills and goodwill, and sensible policy making and sensible legislation. It may take longer but it will be surer and will produce a much improved humanitarian response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish with another quote from the article by Bill Maley and Penelope Mathew. The article begins:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's refugee policy is now in a total mess. Rather than being guided by principles or even a measured pragmatism, it reflects the knee-jerk response of politicians who are desperate to win votes from the least informed parts of the electorate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I acknowledge the contribution of my colleague the member for Pearce. She has been consistent in her views and certainly has cared sufficiently to express them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately the stark reality behind the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill is that the government has lost control of Australia's borders. It is a simple but inescapable conclusion demonstrating a serious policy failure, and after listening to the member for Pearce we can understand just how serious. This action represents the inability of the government to perform even the most fundamental function. A sovereign nation's borders are a part of its very definition. The first way we define a country of the world is to define its borders. This has been the way of human history. Nations have waxed and waned, and that has usually been measured by the expansion and contraction of their borders. Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome are historically defined by the borders they established and defended, and the same applies to civilisations around the world. Wars over borders have been fought throughout history—border issues are probably the cause of more wars than all the other causes combined. Throughout history leaders have been defined by their ability to manage and defend their nation's borders. So, when history reflects on the current government and its ability to manage Australia's borders, it will, unfortunately, only see dreadful, dismal failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse still, in my view, this has become not only a border protection failure but also a humanitarian, social and economic failure. When Labor came to power in 2008, purely driven by cheap politics it simply dumped a successful border protection policy. We did know that policy was a success—only four people were in the detention system at that time. But rather than build on that success the Labor government abandoned it—for all of the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, this has been done at a cost to the community. As I said, there is a social cost, there is an economic cost and there is a humanitarian cost. There is a border protection cost. It is interesting that the Labor government has come to this, given that it was a Democrat in the United States, John F Kennedy, who said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country'. That sentiment is important in this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians are proud of their country and fiercely defensive of our borders. Most Australians do not agree with Labor's approach of abandoning our border protection. They are angry and frustrated. They are angry and frustrated not only because the government has jeopardised Australia's strong border reputation but also because of the financial blow outs that have been revealed. This does cause the social challenges in our community that I have referred to. It does impact on social cohesion, and people do become very concerned about what this approach is costing and who is paying for it. I am frequently asked, as I suspect many members of this House are, particularly in relation to aged care, about what has come out of the ACFI funding model for some of the smaller service providers as opposed to what this policy failure is costing. That is what this type of failure unfortunately causes in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, this was a program that did cost, as we heard earlier, less than $100 million five years ago under the coalition government but it is now costing more than $1 billion under this government. The government said it would spend just $100 million in each of the years of 2010-11 and 2011-12, but they have spent $879 million and $1.2 billion respectively. The government went back to the parliament last year asking for another $295 million to cover the budget blow out, and the year before it needed an extra $120 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents have got to the point where they do not believe that the Labor government can stop the boats or fix this mess. They know this is a dreadful policy failure, and I am concerned about its divisive nature in the community. The people do know that the coalition government had to deal with this in the 1990s. There was a dramatic increase in the number of boat people arrivals, from hundreds in 1998 to 1,000 in 1999—a tenfold increase since the early nineties. By 2001, the then coalition government made it clear that Australia needed to protect its borders and that it would take strong action to do so. In 2001, people smugglers made it to Australia 43 times. Thanks to the tough coalition policies of 2002, in 2002 they only made it once. Over the remaining years of the coalition government, 25 boats entered Australia illegally. That is an average of 3½ boats a year from 2002 to 2008.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there were only four people in the immigration detention system when Labor achieved government in 2007. But, in 2008, the Labor government cast aside that policy and basically threw open Australia's borders. In 2009, people smugglers reached Australia 61 times. In 2010, they earned their illegal income through 134 successful incursions. This basically put the vile people smugglers back in business, and I just cannot accept that. The floodgates reopened. Unfortunately, since Labor abolished the coalition government's Pacific solution, over 30,000 people have arrived on over 500 boats. When I look at that figure of 30,000-plus people, I see a city the size of Busselton, in my electorate. We also know of the tragedies that came with those boats—dreadful tragedies. At least 1,000 asylum seekers and crew have lost their lives at sea, and not one person to date has been processed offshore. Illegal boat arrivals are now occurring at the highest rate on record. We have gone from an average of three boat arrivals a year in 2002 to the arrival of, on average, 2,000 asylum seekers per month in recent times. It is just appalling, in my view, that people smugglers believe they are in control and in charge—and they are clearly making a fortune.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a solution to this problem, because the current approach is haphazard and just a mess, and we as a coalition have solutions to offer. The shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, has provided a bill this week that provides such a solution. The process that we are seeing from this government is in constant confusion. The re-establishment of temporary protection visas is an essential plank of a real response to people smuggling, and the member for Cook's bill will provide real action. Temporary protection visas were a vital and effective tool in ending the trade in human misery that is people smuggling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government of course has used a spurious argument in defence of its refusal of this effective tool. According to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers </span>released in August this year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">TPV grants from inception to abolition (1999-2007) was 11,206.86. Of the 11,206 people granted a TPV, 9,043 were irregular maritime arrivals. Of this number 8,600 (95 per cent) were eventually granted a permanent visa in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor argument is that this somehow demonstrates that TPVs were ineffective. The reality is vastly different. TPVs did not prevent genuine asylum seekers coming to Australia, most of whom gained residency; but they did provide a real disincentive for those who were not genuine refugees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Berowra eloquently talked about the refugees waiting in camps who cannot afford to pay people smugglers exorbitant amounts of money, such as $10,000 or more. It is appalling that these TPV holders were able to gain priority over those who are in camps around the world and who have been denied access to Australia because we have people smugglers plying their vile trade and people who can afford to pay them. I do not support that at all. We need policies that address this but, with this government, that is exactly what we do not have. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers</span> does not identify temporary protection visas as a failure, and the government should stop misleading the community in this way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I understand why the government remain opposed to real solutions: they would have to acknowledge the successful policies of the coalition government. Most Australians understand that strong leadership involves acknowledging your mistakes and correcting them, but this government is not capable of that. Instead, the Labor government have brought another bandaid bill into this House to try and patch up what is a dreadfully failed policy—there is no doubt; we cannot cope with the 2,000 arrivals per month—and people simply do not trust them to get it right. How can you trust a government that cannot protect its borders, that cannot get border protection right? It is a fundamental responsibility of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To go back to where I started, there is no doubt that this is not only a border protection failure; it is also a humanitarian failure, a social failure and an economic failure of core government responsibility and core government policy.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr OAKESHOTT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  I rise to foreshadow an amendment I will be moving to the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 which would put into law the Bali process. I know I have been banging on about this all year, but I know it has the support of both major political parties in this chamber and, I would hope, the support of the vast majority of all members here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment will require an annual report from the minister, whoever that may be, on the Bali process and the work of government in the implementation of the Bali process, to be made to this House. It is good work that is being done, across party lines, offshore, that was started in 2002 by Alexander Downer and is continued under the current government, and, I understand, represented in the process by the minister at the table tonight, Minister Bowen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime is co-chaired by the governments of Indonesia and Australia. It brings together participants to work on very practical measures to help combat people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related transnational crimes throughout our Asia-Pacific region. It is the best we have in regard to the issues associated with slowing the movement of people within our region and trying to deal with issues of criminality associated with people-smuggling and trafficking. It is the mid- to long-term solution that so many people are looking for as the circuit-breaker to much of the short-term language that we hear dominating this debate in Australia today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even Paris Aristotle today in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> again made the compelling case that only a mid-term, comprehensive, regional response will address the issues before the House. Speaking with reference to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers</span>, of which he was a member, Mr Aristotle said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The panel presented an integrated package of 22 recommendations knowing it would take time to implement them … The report’s most important components were measures to establish an effective regional processing and protection framework that would build a safer system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">…      …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">None of the measures are quick fixes, nor can they work on their own. The howls for immediate success and claims that it must have failed even though it has not been fully implemented are examples of the shrillness characterising this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is one of the expert panel members in today's media in an opinion piece reflecting not so much on this legislation but on the ongoing debate that has gone off the rails in Australia today, and on the false expectations that are put to the Australian people from short-termism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">None of the issues in question and at stake that challenge public policy in this area will be nor can be fixed by short-term solutions. They need mid- to long-term solutions and they do require Australia to work with our near neighbours. If we try to go it alone in any particular policy way we will fail, and that is regardless of who is the minister of the day, and regardless of the government of the day, and regardless of which political parties are involved. Unless we work with our near neighbours in a coordinated way, as part of a regional process, we will fail. The recommendations that were made by the expert panel highlight that, and, again, people like Paris Aristotle have been highlighting that today. It is the reference point, the safe port, in all of this for public policy in regard to the Bali process, which is the bipartisan piece of work in all of this, and is something that I hope we can get codified into Australian law today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, like the expert panel, I am certain that regional cooperation and bilateral agreements will be central to the successful implementation of the recommendations of what is now known as the Houston report, and it is essential for the successful establishment of things such as offshore assessment and to protect against loss of life at sea. The movement of refugees in the Asia-Pacific region is not an issue that Australia can deal with in isolation in the absence of cooperation with other countries in our region. While Australia can establish regional processing arrangements in the short term, Australia's domestic policies alone will not easily deter those refugees who are desperately seeking protection from persecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The irregular movement of people affects many countries in our region, as much as if not more than it affects Australia. By and large, those who seek refuge in Australia have transited through the territory of one of Australia's neighbours before they arrive here. Movements into other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, on raw figures alone, are higher than movements into Australia. It is a myth that has made its way into the Australian community that it is any other way. Without a doubt, many of our Asia-Pacific neighbours are more challenged by more movements of asylum seekers than we in Australia are, largely because we are surrounded by water. That alone significantly slows the movement of people to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, we need to work with our near neighbours, not only on issues of people seeking asylum but also on issues that are equally challenging, if not more challenging, and which should challenge us as they should and do challenge our neighbours: issues of criminality associated with smuggling, and—for me, the most insidious of all crimes—the crime of trafficking in persons, a crime to which, in my view, Australia does not give the priority attention that it deserves as an issue of great prevalence throughout the Asia-Pacific region. As I say, in my view, if we are going to have a hierarchy of crimes then that is the worst one of all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The countries of the Asia-Pacific region therefore share a substantial common interest in forming long-term strategies to regulate the movement of people. Indeed, this shared concern has already given rise to multilateral cooperation. As stated before, the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime provides the best regional mechanism through which Australia can encourage and cooperate with other countries in our region on matters relating to irregular migration and related issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bali process is particularly relevant in the context of this bill. It is committed to assisting other countries adopt best practices in asylum management in line with the principles of the refugee convention. Whilst there are countries involved in the Bali process that are not signatories to the refugee convention, this is our best chance as a region to put together a framework. Certainly Australia's obligations as a signatory would not allow us to act in a way that is in breach of our obligations under the refugee convention. Therefore, that is the standard that is set for the Bali process and the principles behind it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's ultimate long-term goal relating to refugees is to see the countries of the Asia-Pacific region treat all refugees in a way that is consistent with the principles of the refugee convention through this Bali process. Only through encouraging our neighbours to protect people from persecution can Australia truly discourage people from making dangerous boat journeys to Australia. That is done in a spirit of cooperation, not in a spirit of paternalism. This is an exercise in trying to work together on the full range of issues that challenge us all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mindful of this long-term imperative of the refugee issue, this House must acknowledge the central role of regional cooperation and the Bali process in informing sustainable and effective policies in this area. It is, therefore, my view—and, I hope, the House's view—that it is appropriate that we insert into this legislation the idea of having 12-monthly reports on the Bali process to the House. Certainly I hope it is an amendment that is considered in its spirit by all.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration and Citizenship</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I thank members for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 in accordance with recommendation 14 of the report of the expert panel on asylum seekers which stated that arrival anywhere in Australia by irregular maritime means should provide individuals with the same status. That is, irregular arrival by sea anywhere in Australia should make a person liable to regional processing arrangements. At the forefront of the panel's reasoning in making this recommendation was the need to reduce any incentive for people to take even greater risks with their lives—such as staying longer on a boat to avoid Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef or some other excised place—in seeking to reach the Australian mainland and avoid being subject to regional processing arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the panel emphasised, and as the government has acknowledged, the recommendations in this report are an integrated package. We have not accepted or rejected each recommendation; we accepted them all as a whole. Therefore, we are moving to implement every single recommendation. This is something that I have freely acknowledged many times publicly and it is indicative of the fact that we are the only party—not those opposite and not the Greens party—implementing all the recommendations of the expert panel's report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, this bill is directed squarely at boat arrivals, but so is the expert panel's report. As members would recall from the emotional but ultimately fruitless parliamentary debate of some months ago, the expert panel was prompted by people getting on boats and dying at sea. Hence the government implemented this as a circuit-breaker to get a breakthrough. We got the recommendations and we have been implementing them. Those arriving by plane are not the ones dying en route to Australia and are not the focus of this bill. Those arriving by plane are not risking their lives to get here. The very clear and universally agreed aim of the policy changes underlined by the expert panel's recommendations is the need to remove the incentive for people to take the dangerous journey by boat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly the expert panel makes a very strong recommendation for this bill, as I say, in order to remove what could be a perverse incentive to stay longer on boats. This bill is not about excising the Australian mainland from the migration zone. The definition of the migration zone is not being amended in this bill. Rather, a person will be subject to regional processing based on their status as an unauthorised maritime arrival—that is, by arriving in Australia, in the migration zone, by sea without a valid visa. This is in contrast to the current situation where an individual is only subject to regional processing if they enter Australia at an excised offshore place such as Christmas Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have freely admitted and acknowledged that people will very obviously take a range of views on this issue—about this issue in particular and about the general issue more broadly. As I have said in other places, if after deeply considering all the issues people reach a different position and their moral compass points a different way, I will acknowledge and respect it. But people who argue entirely for onshore processing must acknowledge that that will continue to provide an incentive to come to Australia by boat. Without taking difficult decisions such as this, it would mean, inevitably, more deaths at sea. That is the simple fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to deal with the contribution of the member for Melbourne. In his speech he said that this government has not implemented extra pathways to Australia. He said, 'If only this government would implement some way for people to get to Australia more safely, if only this government would provide more places for those people in Indonesia, that would be the right thing to do.' The member for Melbourne seems unaware that we are doing exactly that. The member for Melbourne seems unaware or chooses to ignore the fact that this government has increased the humanitarian program to 20,000 places—the biggest increase in the humanitarian program in 30 years. As has been noted publicly this week, that is not a universal position across this chamber anymore. It was for a little while. It is not anymore. This government is committed to increasing the humanitarian program. In fact, we have done so. More visas have been issued offshore as a result of the increase to the humanitarian program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we will not do is focus that increase in the program entirely and exclusively on Indonesia. That would be to say that Australia's entire humanitarian program should be focused on those who can at least get to Indonesia, if not to Australia, because they can afford a people smuggler to get them to Indonesia or can get to Indonesia under their own steam. Our humanitarian program is about much more than that. It is about providing those alternative pathways, but it is also about providing hope to people who could not possibly afford a people smuggler—people in camps in Africa, people in camps in the Middle East, people in camps in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia—and other people who cannot make it to Indonesia. The Greens take a short-sighted approach that says, 'We're focused on Indonesia.' That is ignoring our moral responsibility to those in different parts of the world who deserve at least the chance of resettlement in Australia. So I completely reject the assertions of the honourable member for Melbourne, who just wilfully ignores the fact that this government has increased the humanitarian program to 20,000 places—yes, at some substantial cost to the budget because of the substantial resettlement support that we provide. The member for Melbourne seems to have not noticed this in the public debate in recent weeks, as the Greens regularly ignore things which are inconvenient to their argument. I suggest perhaps they are not alone there in this House occasionally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government continues to implement the panel recommendations and more. Today we saw another transfer of people back to Sri Lanka, people who are not exercising Australia's international obligations. We are swiftly returning them to Sri Lanka. So people who are coming to Australia for economic reasons are clearly being dealt with by our law and being returned to Sri Lanka—something that the Howard government was never able to achieve. Swift returns to Sri Lanka, in some cases within days of arrival, are being done by this government, because we have seen an increase in people arriving in Australia from Sri Lanka and a lot of this is clearly for economic purposes. But what we will not do is ignore our obligations under the refugee convention. We will at least hear the reasons for people's travel to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the opposition would turn boats around on the high seas—in my view, a breach of the refugee convention. We will not do that. But what we are doing is safely returning people to Sri Lanka. We are not conducting difficult and unsafe operations on the high seas but safely returning people by aeroplane to Sri Lanka. We have returned a very considerable number of people in recent weeks and we will continue to do so. We have also seen some voluntary returns, to Sri Lanka in particular but other nations as well—Iran in particular. But Sri Lanka is the nation which has received the most voluntary returns. Since 30 August more than 600 Sri Lankans have returned home, which I think underlines the point that people smugglers are selling false promises about what awaits people in Australia. They are selling the false promise of a fast track to a visa and what we are very clearly doing is giving the lie to that promise, taking action which is swift and which clearly shows the message. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government's policy is clear. We want to resettle more refugees in Australia. We want to give more people the chance of life in Australia. We want to see 20,000 refugees resettled in Australia every year, which would make us the largest resettlement country in the world per capita and the second largest in absolute terms for UNHCR referred refugees. Certainly on some of the measures we are very close to Canada in terms of resettlement. It is this side of the House which is doing that. It is this side of the House which is committed to doing that. It is only this side of the House which is committed to giving more people the chance of life in Australia while also taking the difficult decisions to dissuade people from risking their lives to get to Australia by sea. It is very easy to say that that is not necessary. It is the government which has a responsibility to do so and we will continue to do so.</span>

The bill makes minor amendments to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 to correct referencing inconsistencies and improve the readability of the act. The bill also amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to specialist trainees. It is the government's policy to increase access to high-quality clinical training capacity for all medical professionals by working closely with states and territories, funding additional training capacity and facilitating innovative and flexible training models. The proposed legislation takes an innovative training arrangement that has been available to trainee specialists from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and expands it so that trainee specialists from all recognised medical colleges have access. The legislation permits a trainee specialist from any recognised medical college to conduct a procedure under the direct supervision of a specialist in a private setting and have that service attract a Medicare rebate for the supervising surgeon. The procedure will be considered to have been performed by the supervising surgeon, who will retain the right to any bulk-billed Medicare benefits in relation to the procedure. This further expands the country's training capacity for specialists, at a time when clinical training capacity for all health professionals in our health system is under significant stress, and it does so with no additional cost to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will make changes to section 41C of the Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973, the Medicare act, and these are being progressed to ensure that Medicare Locals and other bodies seeking to use the term 'Medicare' are able to apply for an authorisation to use the term without breaching the Medicare act. Medicare Locals will help to drive improvements in Australia's primary healthcare system. Medicare Locals have been established through a staged implementation process, with all Medicare Locals now having commenced operations, the final ones by 1 July 2012. The government is aware that there are a range of views about the use of the name 'Medicare Local', and I want to thank the member for Lyne for his thoughtful contribution in that regard. I am pleased to advise the House that a national evaluation of Medicare Locals, already planned to start early next year, will consider the degree to which the name 'Medicare Local' is suitable for its purpose. Provisions will be made for the evaluator to specifically look at community acceptance of the name.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill will make changes to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989. The objective of the minor technical amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act is to correct an inaccurate description of how chemicals are kept under control of Customs during transshipment. The proposed amendment allows industry to utilise more short-term storage options, while maintaining health and safety. It does not place any restriction on competition and does not place any additional requirements on business. I would like to acknowledge the support of stakeholders for the proposed amendment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will ensure the name 'Medicare' is protected into the future. This bill seeks to correct another botched implementation by Labor. They created primary healthcare organisations operating under the name 'Medicare Locals', a name which is technically unlawful under Commonwealth legislation. Nothing could better highlight this government's incompetence. Nothing could better highlight the fact that this government was merely after a headline as opposed to a health outcome. Nothing could better highlight the fact that this government has stumbled from one disaster to the next when it comes to the health portfolio. What competent government could enlist the assistance of primary healthcare organisations and insist on them being called Medicare Locals, bearing in mind that the government, in their Medicare Locals, do not provide any Medicare assistance? You cannot go into a Medicare Local office to have your Medicare claim processed. You cannot go into a Medicare Local office to see a doctor or a nurse or to seek medical advice or attention. You cannot go into a Medicare Local office and ask for advice in relation to Medicare matters. Medicare Locals have nothing to do with Medicare whatsoever. Why did this government decide to call them Medicare Locals? Because it thought it could fool the Australian people into believing that somehow this was a network of retail services, which of course it is not. That this government, in the height of its incompetence, would allow the use of the word 'Medicare' in the title of these primary healthcare organisations, knowing that it contravenes federal legislation, just speaks to the absolute continuing incompetence of the Gillard government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:38</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 because it allows the opposition to place on the record the background, the history and the reality behind the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and this current bill as proposed by the government. Let me begin with context. The House will, over the coming days, face two significant issues. One is the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which has been a source of much debate and has been categorically mishandled by the government, in our judgement and in my view in particular. We will also face this complementary legislation with regard to the special account which will allow the government of the day to acquire and take steps to improve infrastructure in such a way that there are no additional buybacks to achieve on a voluntary basis between nought and 450 gigalitres of additional water. It is about giving government an option. It is, in our judgement, about categorically excluding additional buybacks as part of the special account. That is the government's apparently stated position. That is our categorical position, and it is what we will do in government. Those two issues are before the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The context is this. In January 2007, the Howard government laid on the table grand plans for reform of the Murray-Darling Basin in a way which had not been seen since Federation, but we did so from the position that we had to achieve fairness between upstream and downstream users. We also did so on the basis that we would allocate funds with an overwhelming focus on a once-in-a-century replumbing of rural Australia. In reality, that means sharing the benefits between farmers and the environment, between irrigators and the environment, between agriculture and the environment and, above all else, between communities and the environment. Our plan, our vision, our approach, our allocation and our commitment were to do so through upgrading on-farm infrastructure and general agricultural infrastructure in terms of the pipes, the channels, the transport mechanisms, between the river and the farm itself. Those were the two critical areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For five years, much of that work has been shamefully neglected by the government. This plan for a once-in-a-century replumbing which allowed us to produce food through greater efficiency, which allowed us to deliver to rural Australia a grand, once-in-a-century national efficiency dividend, has largely been ignored by the government. At the last minute, they have now apparently rediscovered the essential tenets of what was laid out in 2007 by John Howard, by Malcolm Turnbull and by the coalition. That in turn built on much of the work of John Anderson from an earlier period, something with which I am proud to say I had some very early involvement during the period of 2001 to 2004 and 2004 to 2007 in different ways. But that was always a plan based on funding upgrades of infrastructure, of piping, of channelling and of lining of dams, and improvement of irrigation approaches. Those are the things which we set in place, which we funded, the vast bulk of which has been sat upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That funding has not been used by the government for the purpose for which it was intended. Instead, we have seen a wholesale buyout of farms and farmers, of rural communities. Much of it has been non-strategic. Much of it has been buying for the sake of buying, and much of it has contributed to the great stress in rural Australia which has accompanied the formation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Against that background, at the last minute, at the last second, the government has rediscovered infrastructure—on-farm infrastructure, interfarm infrastructure and now, I am pleased to say, something which we have advocated and I myself have been personally involved in, environmental infrastructure—as a means of making grand and significant savings without harming rural productivity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach to the Murray-Darling Basin and our approach to this legislation is very clear. Other than the remaining 249 gigalitres and other than the fact that all of this adds up to a maximum of 1,500 gigalitres of buyback, the time for buyback is finished. The time for infrastructure investment, for modernising our farms, for giving farmers the opportunity to be efficient and for sharing the benefits, where there is public investment for public benefit, is upon us. It is sad that this government, which had made major commitments at a much earlier time, has failed to deliver. The upgrade of the Menindee Lakes, which has been promised at successive elections and which will no doubt be promised again, is an example of work promised and not delivered. Those promises, Minister, were express, clear, absolute, in writing and undelivered. There is no question about that. This government embarked upon a wholesale buyback, a wholesale buyout of rural capacity, and it is only now that the recognition has arrived that the right way forward is through the once-in-a-century replumbing of rural Australia, which we always intended as the heart, the soul, the essence of any fair Basin Plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made it clear that we will look at this Basin Plan and accept it and support it. I recognise that there are some who may not be in a position to do that because they have their concerns, and I am deeply respectful of that. But as a coalition our view is very clear that this plan has finally, belatedly, after five years, adopted the critical elements which we believe are necessary to ensure that there is long-term sustainability both of our farms and our farming and rural communities and of the river and the downstream communities. We also—this brings me to this legislation—are willing to be supportive, but there are some critical amendments which are fundamental. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go specifically to the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012. This bill establishes a special account to acquire additional environmental water for the Murray-Darling. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, who is at the table, announced this bill in Adelaide, with a promise that it would recover up to an additional 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. They gave a commitment that water would only be recovered in an economically neutral way via 'on farm infrastructure projects'. We intend to hold them to account on that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the plan—the broader Murray-Darling Basin Plan—2,750 gigalitres would be returned to the environment. That is the process which we envisaged, which we imagined, which we began but which we always planned against the constraint of protecting upstream communities and downstream communities and doing it overwhelmingly through funded infrastructure where the benefits were shared. The parliament has now passed a bill to allow that figure to adjust up or down by a total of 710 gigalitres if certain criteria are met, and this particular bill seeks to put aside money to pay for additional water to allow the 2,750 gigalitres to increase by up 450 gigalitres. The bill appropriates $1.77 billion until 2024. Only $55 million is included in the forward estimates. So, as is usually the case, it is a sleight of hand. Three per cent of the required funds appear in the forward estimates, in the budgetary life of this government. The rest are for future governments to find. The government are accountable for three per cent and they leave the bill for others. Yes, they allocate it by law, but it is always another government at another time in another place that has to find the money. So it is effectively a blank cheque they have written, but they have done it again with a sleight of hand—$55 million out of $1.77 billion is allocated during the forward estimates period, during the accountable period for which this government is responsible. That adds up to three per cent. That is what has been actually funded in the life of this government's budgetary cycle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we go forward, we support the use of on farm infrastructure as a genuine means of making progress. We support steps which will not weaken social or economic living standards and will not cause social or economic detriment. The challenge here is that we wish to know whether the physical constraints will be met. There is a small amount of money to try to alter the height of bridges. We have our doubts—deep doubts—as to whether that is legitimate and reasonable and realistic. Having lived through the pink batts program, the green loans program and the phantom credits program, and having seen the citizens assembly and cash for clunkers promised, I know that their record of making grand environmental promises and not delivering is almost perfect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us note this: there are real constraints. Delivering more than 2,750 gigalitres of water to the environment undoubtedly requires removing a number of physical constraints in the system. Whether that is lifting bridges, whether that is moving roads, whether that is easements on private land or whether that is changing water operation rules, the government has to indicate how it realistically believes that can be achieved through the amount which they have allocated. I doubt that they can do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One example is that flows between the Hume dam and the Yarrawonga weir, which I know well from my own history, are limited to a maximum of 25,000 megalitres per day. We are advised that lifting the water recovery target to 3,200 gigalitres would require flows of 40,000 megalitres per day. So, against that background, there are some significant issues for the government to address. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, we want to ensure that there is deep, strong protection against social and economic detriment. The government has said that it would only recover more water in ways that are neutral in social or economic terms, but these commitments are not in the bill. They are not express, they are not clear, they are not absolute and they are not adequate. Our report in the Senate makes that point clear, and, having studied this myself, I also believe that there are critical amendments which we will have to make. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other critical element is about restricting further buybacks. Labor has spent $2 billion on water buybacks, yet only $500 million on infrastructure projects that can deliver water back to the basin—$4 on buybacks for every $1 on infrastructure. Our approach was precisely the opposite—$4 on infrastructure for every $1 on buybacks. They have reversed the order of things for ideological reasons and only now, after five years, have they discovered that the right way forward is to increase productivity rather than reduce production in the Murray-Darling Basin. I am advised that, as at the end of May 2012, the government had spent just 15 per cent of the $4.6 billion allocated toward projects to deliver water into the basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also, as I mentioned at the outset, want to give the example of the Menindee Lakes. And I note that the minister looked quizzical at first, but the government promised $400 million for the Menindee Lakes in 2007. It made another promise in 2010. Five years later, and the best advice we have is that just $21 million has been spent on re-engineering the Menindee Lakes, which have a potential of up to 100 gigalitres a year of savings which could be shared with the river and done so in a way which would reduce the loss of water through evaporation. All of the $21 million has been spent of different consulting and other reports. Not a single drop of water, to the best of our knowledge, to the best of our ability, to the best of our awareness, has actually been saved. After five years and a pledge of $400 million, there has been a failure to deliver real infrastructure and real water savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to foreshadow the coalition's amendments ahead of the steps to be taken during the consideration in detail stage. We will make some critical amendments, and they are in two fundamental areas. The first is that we will seek to remove the ability to use the funds in the special account to purchase water access rights. That is entirely consistent with what the government has pledged and promised, and with what the Prime Minister and the minister have said. The government has argued that this special account is not about water buybacks but is about achieving water recovery through on-farm efficiency upgrades. Indeed, in announcing this special account, the minister at the table stated that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now, the extra 450 gigalitres is acquired through the sorts of on-farm infrastructure projects that we've run to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only problem with that, of course, is that there have been very few real on-farm infrastructure projects, as opposed to what we had always envisaged. The amendment from the coalition will ensure that this commitment to end the buybacks for the remaining additional water is reflected in this legislation. We also expect that the government will resist the pressure from the Senate to make it mandatory. This is a voluntary program that the Senate recommended, headed by one of the government's own senators, be a mandatory program to achieve exactly 450 gigalitres of additional water, not anywhere between nought and 450. I would ask the minister, in good faith, to acknowledge that. The government say that their ability to purchase water rights will only be used when related to improving water efficiency on farms. They are effectively saying 'trust us', even though there is not much trust, given the record to date. We will put that trust to the test of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a second series of amendments which we wish to make. These amendments clarify that any water recovered through this fund is only to be recovered in a way which is neutral or beneficial with regard to socioeconomic outcomes, and we do this through three steps in terms of the package of amendments. Firstly, our amendments will insert into the objects of the bill that neutral or beneficial socioeconomic outcomes must be achieved. Secondly, our amendments will limit the amount of water that can be bought back in total, in globo, in absolute figures, to 1,500 gigalitres across the entire plan, consistent with the government's announced water recovery strategy. I want to particularly pay tribute to the member for Farrer, Susan Ley, for this amendment. She has fought for a 1,500 gigalitre cap, supported by other members of the coalition, namely the members for Murray, for Mallee and for Riverina. However, this 1,500 gigalitre cap, which we seek on total buybacks, is the member for Farrer's work, and she should be acknowledged for that. Thirdly, our amendments will require that the secretary of the department report on how any water recovered achieves a neutral or beneficial socioeconomic outcome in the annual report required under this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be very clear, our intention is to accept this bill and our commitment is to support the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. But our commitment in government, if we are elected and if these amendments are not passed, is to ensure that there is the exclusion of buybacks for any part of the additional 450 gigalitres. Our commitment in government, if elected, will be to ensure that there is a neutral or beneficial socioeconomic outcome from any attempt to achieve the 450 gigalitres or any part of that. Our commitment in government will be to put in place an absolute cap of 1,500 gigalitres on buybacks, consistent with the government's announced water recovery strategy. Those amendments are what we will seek now, and they are absolutely the commitment as to what we will do in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, we have approached this through a position of good faith. The plan which was placed before the parliament yesterday is radically different from what was placed on the table shortly after the election. That is a tribute to the work of many members of the coalition and, to the extent that the government has accepted those elements, that is appreciated. Senator Joyce, Senator Birmingham and the four members whom I have noted previously have all played a critical role in achieving those changes. The plan for Australia going forward should be a once in a century replumbing of rural Australia, not a buy-out of our farms and our farmers which is what we have seen to date. Having said that, our amendments are on the table. They are about protecting upstream communities whilst guaranteeing downstream communities real access to sustainable flows over the coming century. For those reasons we seek not to oppose this bill and we support the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, but we expect that the government will treat our amendments in good faith.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:58</span>):  I take this opportunity to speak in support of the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 that is currently before the House. I understand that yesterday the minister who is in the chamber here tonight tabled the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in this place. The tabling of that plan saw the culmination of a very long, difficult and exhaustive process that began about five years ago when this government came to office in November 2007—a process that has two very important outcomes. Firstly, it provides a high level of certainty for Murray-Darling Basin communities and for the environment within the Murray-Darling Basin area. Secondly, it transfers responsibility for basin communities, and the environment therein, from the states to the federal government. It effectively overcomes 100 years of bickering and disputes between the states, and it was a Labor government that finally brought that together. It was the minister who sits in the House before us tonight who did that. It was not members opposite, as the previous speaker would have you believe, who should get the credit for what is before us tonight. It is the minister who sits at the table who has worked through this process from day one and who has finally delivered something that we can put to the parliament that both is credible and will provide the certainty that I referred to. It is indeed an historic moment for Australia as a whole to have reached this point, and it is an historic moment in terms of water reform within this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having tabled the plan, I understand that it may be disallowed by the parliament if members in this place choose to take that position and move a disallowance motion. We were told by the minister today in question time that the Greens have already lodged a disallowance motion in the Senate. I find that incredibly disappointing. I find it disappointing because if the plan is rejected we then have nothing and we go back to where we started from, and that is the uncertainty that we face until this plan gets through parliament. There will be no certainty for communities within the Murray-Darling Basin, no certainty for the growers and irrigators who rely on the waters from the Murray-Darling system, and no certainty for the environment. I say to members in this place, and to any members in the other place who might be taking note of this debate, surely the plan that is currently before the parliament is better than what we have, because what we have is effectively nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For South Australia, transferring responsibility from the states to the federal government and having a basin-wide plan is important because South Australia, being at the end of the system, is very much reliant on the goodwill of the upstream states. As we have seen in the past, when the water system diminishes so does that goodwill. The basin plan sets a long-term average sustainable diversion limit reduction of 2,750 gigalitres. The government has committed to acquiring an additional 450 gigalitres in permanent environmental water entitlements and an easing of flow restrictions. For South Australia and for the environment that is a much welcomed additional commitment by the federal government because it means a lot for South Australia. For South Australia it means more water for environmental assets, including the iconic wetlands and river red gums along the system within South Australia. For South Australia it means more water for the Lower Lakes. It means lower salinity levels in the Lower Lakes. It means lower salinity levels in the Coorong, particularly the northern lagoon. It means less likelihood of the Murray mouth requiring dredging. It also means about two million tonnes of salt will be flushed out to sea each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a South Australian I visited that part of the river system on several occasions, and I particularly visited at the height of the drought when the local environment was at its worst. There was no water flowing through the mouth and there was a dredging machine operating continuously for about two or three years prior to that, simply to try to keep little bit of water flowing through it. I saw the lakes. There were jetties in the lakes which were actually jetties on sand, because as far as you could walk out it was simply sand—there was no water in the lakes. The people who had moved down there to change their lifestyles and live in that part of the region were living in a pretty dry and barren area. The native vegetation around the place was almost all gone. In addition to that, we saw the emergence of acid sulphate soils and many of the local creatures of the area dying, including the turtles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the perilous state that the lakes system had reached at the height of the drought because we did not have a plan. I have been there since and I can tell members that the situation has changed immensely. It has changed because we have had good rains over the last couple of years, the water has started flowing again, the salt has been flushed out of the lake system and the environment has regenerated. We were told earlier this year, when we went out there, that had the drought continued for a few more months the damage probably would have been irreversible. That is how close we came to what we would refer to as a tipping point. Fortunately, it was reversible and the local environment has regenerated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the changes that the 3,200 gigalitres can bring to that part of South Australia are based on science—science that has been prepared for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and, in turn, peer reviewed by the Goyder Institute for Water Research on behalf the South Australian government. That peer review modelling was enough for the South Australian government to say, 'We will withdraw our proposed High Court action against the plan if we don't get more water'. The South Australian government was originally looking for an even higher figure than that, but the South Australian government was prepared to accept the science, which is the very science that underpins this plan and the plan that the minister is now putting to the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sets out the process and the mechanism by which the additional 450 gigalitres will be secured. The government amendments also make clear that the additional 450 gigalitres is not just an ideal figure put in the bill for the sake of having a figure there but it is a clear target firmly committed to by this government and by the minister. In support of that clear target and commitment, the government is prepared to commit $1.775 million over the next decade, place it into a special account and use it for the purpose of acquiring the additional 450 gigalitres of environmental water that is being sought. I believe that that is as firm a commitment as any government could be expected to make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard the members opposite speaking on this matter, and I understand that not every sector is happy with the proposed plan as it currently stands. But I have also read some of the reports that come from some of the rural communities and some of the environmental communities, and it is interesting that we have a mixed bag. Some people speaking up on behalf of the farming sector believe that this is a pretty fair plan. Similarly, some who speak up on behalf of the environmentalists feel the same. At the same time, there are people at the extreme ends of both of those arguments that argue that 3,200 gigalitres is not the right figure. Some environmentalists argue that it ought to be higher; some farming communities say that it is already too high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that only time will prove exactly who is right. Right now, in the absence of time, we have a responsible plan being put where nothing else exists, and it is a start of a process that is not only based on good science but that will be open to continuous reviews if the need arises. So, as the need arises I am sure that this government or future governments will be able to make minor adjustments to it. As we have seen in other legislation, we have already provided the flexibility of five per cent movement up or down in terms of the sustainable diversion limits of water from each individual area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that the minister is here, I would like to commend him in leading the debate on this issue. It is clear to me that the minister has listened to the communities in the Murray-Darling Basin system as part of his determination of this plan. As a supplementary member of the Winsor inquiry into this issue I also went out and spoke to community members right along that system. And I picked up on what they were saying. And it is clear that the minister has taken note of what they are saying. That is clear because he has done two very critical things. First, he has extended out the time frame, which enables the transition to take place over a longer period, and therefore has less impact on any local communities. Second, he has ensured that the additional 450 gigalitres will be taken from irrigation efficiency measures and not through the purchase of water entitlements. And they were two very clear messages that were being sent out to the committee that I was a part of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But perhaps the most important message that was being sent out to the committee was that people along the entire system wanted to have a degree of certainty. The speaker who preceded me—the opposition spokesman for the environment—was talking about farming communities. I well understand the difficulties that farming communities have experienced over the last decade. I understand because I have been out there, I have seen their farms and I have spoken to the people. Their hardships are very real; there is no question about that at all. But their hardships were brought about, I suspect, for two critical reasons. The first reason was the drought, and as a result of the drought there was insufficient water in the system. Had we had a plan in place 10 years ago, they might have been better off because the water that was in the system would have been better managed and that in turn would have meant that they had more reliability and might have been able to get through the drought a little better than they did. At the height of the drought many farmers had access to zero water. They had no water at all. And if they wanted to grow crops they had to go and buy the water that they needed—and buy it at a very high price. It was a price that, quite frankly, I doubt that many of them could have afforded. Because they got themselves into debt—both because they could not grow produce and because what they did grow came at a very high price—they find themselves today in a really difficult situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason for the hardship is the high Australian dollar. There is no question at all that that is affecting exports, including the exports of the growers along the Murray-Darling system. If we are going to provide them with any kind of support I think the best thing we can do for them is to say to them, 'You can now look to the future with a degree of certainty,' because if they have certainty they can plan accordingly. And if they plan accordingly they are more likely to get through difficult times much better. As I said, at the height of the drought a lot of farmers found it incredibly hard because for a lot of them it was the first time that they had been faced with such severe consequences and such severe situations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now return to where I started in terms of the importance of this legislation to South Australia. For South Australia this is important not only to the people in the Lower Lakes, down at the Coorong and the Murray mouth area, but also to the growers in the South Australian Riverland. They, like growers across Australia, went through hardships. Unlike growers in some parts—not growers in all areas, because I believe there have been very responsible growers right across the system—they made investments in water efficiencies in the late sixties and around 1969. Unlike farmers in some areas, they did not increase their water entitlements; they stuck to their entitlements, so they have done all they can to make the system sustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reliance now is on what happens upstream, because at the end of the day South Australians consume about seven per cent of the total amount of water that is taken out of the system. So, in effect, South Australia's contribution to fixing or breaking the system is much less than it is for others. But for South Australia, at the end of the system, this plan means a lot. It means security for the state in terms of the water supplies we need at the lower end, and it means security for the growers who rely on the waters of the Murray for their living. I commend the plan to the House.</span>

I will now proceed with the division that was called for earlier and deferred in accordance with standing order 133(b). The question is that the amendments moved by the honourable member for Dickson be agreed to.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:40</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the National Gambling Reform Bill 2012. Can I say that, from the outset, the coalition acknowledges that gambling is a major problem for some Australians, and that is why we on this side of the House support measures that will effectively tackle problem gambling and help to address and prevent gambling addiction. But any response to gambling problems must recognise that many Australians gamble responsibly. Indeed, the majority of Australians who have a gamble—whether they gamble on the poker machines or go to a casino or a club or have a wager at the races—gamble responsibly. In addition to that, many Australians also rely on the sector for their jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make it entirely clear that the coalition supports voluntary precommitment, as do all the states in Australia. Labor's approach depends on who they have done a political deal with and, it seems like, on the day of the week. The government's proposed legislative package has a sordid history. It had its origins in the political deal the Prime Minister did with the member for Denison to keep the keys to the Lodge; then there was the betrayal of the member for Denison and now the usual capitulation by the once-proud Labor Party to the Greens. We have seen it all before and, unfortunately for the Australian people, we are seeing it again tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is deeply concerned about the lack of time the government has permitted for proper consultation and review of this legislation. We are concerned because we have seen before the damage that is caused by rushed legislation, the messes left in the wake of ramming bills through the parliament and the inevitable need to go back and fix the problems the government itself created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all else, we add our voice to the calls of many others that legislation of such alleged significance for addressing gambling problems in our communities deserves much greater scrutiny and community consultation. That is why we believe that a more thorough inquiry should have been undertaken, and that is why we have tried in the other place, in the Senate, to have this bill referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that despite all of the complexity, and despite the clear fact that the states and territories will be compelled to play a key role in this new duplication of regulation, the government has steamrolled ahead with no consultation with the other sectors of government. Of even more concern is the fact that the government has wilfully ignored all the warnings from the agencies and organisations who are the experts in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the industry itself, the thousands of business owners and clubs involved in the hospitality sector have not only been ignored; they have been entirely locked out. There can be no clearer example of just what lengths this government will go to in order to cling to political survival and their Green lifeline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills would see a further extension of Commonwealth influence over state and territory jurisdictions. Gambling within Australia, for the past century, has always constitutionally been within state responsibilities. We truly believe that merely creating regulatory duplication and legislating in an area that falls within state responsibilities will do nothing to help problem gamblers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also sought to gloss over what will be a significant impost on clubs and pubs throughout Australia—that is, the cost of the implementation of this legislation. For the smaller venues in rural and regional Australia—areas the Labor government would know nothing about, given that they do not seem to represent any of them—these new laws will have a direct impact on financial viability and, in turn, on employment in many parts of Australia. Manufacturers and operators of machines have also warned of the dangers of widespread noncompliance and about the fact that the government's own time frames are quite simply unachievable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give an example of this, we have had promises and indications that there would be a trial in the ACT. From the very outset, the trial in the ACT has been problematic. Why? First of all, it was because the clubs in the ACT had not signed up to the trial. They had not signed up to the trial because the government had not come to the party in terms of actually providing the detail about what that trial would involve.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ANDREWS:</span>
                    </a>  Sorry, the member for Sturt. I appreciate his rapt attention to my remarks tonight. Regarding the trial in the ACT, if I can come back to the subject, the ACT industry has been warning for months that this was simply unachievable in the time frame that was being proposed by the government. Not only had the compensation arrangements not been determined by the government, the scope of the trial in terms of whether or not clubs just over the border from the ACT—in Queanbeyan—were going to be involved in the trial or not had not been determined. None of that had been determined, yet the government was blithely pushing ahead with the view that this trial could occur in the time frame proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the industry, the people who were the manufacturers and the people who were responsible for modifying the gambling machines in order for a trial to take place, had been saying to us from at least February of this year that the time frame was totally unrealistic and totally unachievable. This is a government that said, 'We are going to do this.' But in fact the reality is that the implementation was certainly unachievable. That has been the so-called mandatory precommitment trial in the ACT. It has been a case of wishful thinking at best on the part of the government and something that has simply been unable to be delivered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past year, I have travelled around Australia; I have visited some of the many thousands of clubs around our great nation. I have visited clubs that form local hubs and community hubs and that are run for the benefit of the community. Whether they are a sporting club, a local community club or a surf lifesaving club, they fund important programs, important activities, local sports and youth events. They fund community initiatives and they provide critical philanthropic support to causes that we know all too well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my message to the Labor Party is to stop fighting the ideological battles of the Greens and to stop attacking the grassroots organisations that actually do good in our community. Where are these organisations? Many of these organisations and clubs can be found in the western suburbs of Sydney, traditional areas of Labor support. They can be found on the North Coast, the mid-coast and the South Coast of New South Wales, which are traditional areas of Labor support. They can be found in the outer suburban areas and the regional areas of Queensland, which are traditional areas of Labor support. Yet this is a party so driven by the Greens that they are implementing legislation that the Greens want, rather than respecting the wishes, the desires and the contributions of their local communities that have traditionally been supporters of the Labor Party throughout Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's obsession with mandatory precommitment means that, if given the opportunity, they could flick the switch and turn it on when this bill is meant to be about voluntary precommitment. You have to ask the question: why is the Commonwealth parliament introducing a bill for voluntary precommitment in the states and territories of Australia? A number of questions come to mind. Firstly, isn't this an area of state and territory regulation? Don't the states and the territories license clubs and poker machines in Australia? Does the Constitution provide, in section 51, for the Commonwealth regulation of this area? The answer is a resounding no. If there is any area that is clearly a state and territory responsibility it is this. So why is the Commonwealth interfering in this area?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, then, you should ask the question every time, 'Is legislation necessary?' The states and the territories are all moving towards implementing schemes of voluntary precommitment. The industry itself is committed to voluntary precommitment. The very object of this bill, the very purpose of this legislation—namely, to introduce voluntary precommitment—is already the subject of the proposals and the movement in the states, the territories and the industry itself. So why do we need the Commonwealth, in an area which is not its legislative responsibility and is not its constitutional domain, to move into voluntary precommitment when the states, the territories and industry are doing it? It is a good question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If legislation is being proposed, there should be this threshold test: why do we need this legislation? I can understand the argument from a Commonwealth perspective that we should introduce legislation if the states are failing to do it, but this is not the case. The states are doing it and the industry is doing it. So why do we need this? The answer is quite obvious: this is a political deal with the Greens in order to continue to prop up a minority government that has always relied, from day one, on a number of members sitting over there on the crossbench. It relied on Andrew Wilkie, the member for Denison, who did a deal with this government, with the Prime Minister who stands at this dispatch box every day, in order to prop up her place in the Lodge after the last election. As soon as she thought she did not need Andrew Wilkie, the member for Denison, to prop up that arrangement she cut him loose. I have to say to the member for Denison: where is the honour? Where is the purpose in what you are supporting here when she cut you loose, and now what are you doing? Scrambling to make a position that even the Prime Minister herself does not believe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that tackling gambling requires a measured response that does not just look at poker machines, like this legislation, but tackles the underlying problem of gambling addiction throughout this nation. Fundamentally, problem gambling can only be tackled by providing problem gamblers with counselling and support services. The coalition is committed to addressing problem gambling, but Labor seems to be obsessed with fighting ideological battles on behalf of the Greens, who continue to prop them up in government. Duplicating regulation and legislating within state and territory responsibilities does nothing to help problem gamblers, and that is why the coalition will oppose this bill.</span>

An article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> last year noted the phenomenon in St Johns Park Bowling Club where at 2.30 on a Sunday morning the club starts handing out $100 notes. In order to win those $100 notes gamblers need to swipe their membership cards at a reward centre and wait. The article went on to talk about other incidents and other factors that ensure that gamblers are unable to take themselves out of the zone and stop and reflect on how much they have spent and decide whether they want to stop playing. It pointed out that the machines in St Johns have an attendant button—a sort of room service so pokie players do not have to leave their machines to get a drink. The practice is banned in Victoria but popular in New South Wales.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Parliamentary Library <span style="font-style:italic;">FlagPost</span> article by Amanda Biggs noted that the prevalence of problem gambling is highest in low socioeconomic areas of Australia. It noted, for example, that in Greater Dandenong the average weekly income is $426 and pokie losses are $1,110 per adult. By contrast, Boroondara has an average income of $836 a week and average losses of $153 an adult. So this is very much a social justice issue. This is an issue where those of us who care about the most disadvantaged in Australia are compelled to act.</span>

As a representative of the ACT, I could not help thinking: is this the same member for Menzies who introduced a private member's bill to override the rights of the territories on the issue of euthanasia? I think it might be. I think it might be the very same member for Menzies. So, when it suits him, he is happy to come into this place and use federal authority to override other jurisdictions, but, on an issue that he does not think is appropriate, he will not do that. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think in this case it is appropriate to have a national approach. It is a national approach that is grounded in behavioural economics. The great thing about precommitment is that no-one is forced to do anything. You are simply asked to set your limit. That limit that you set can be as high or as low as you want it to be. All we are doing with mandatory precommitment is allowing people to keep the promises that they make to themselves. We are allowing people to set a limit and to have the club assist them in sticking to that limit. We know—as the stories I read out this evening illustrated so powerfully—that people get in the zone. They walk into a club or pub intending to spend no more than $200, and they walk out scratching their head wondering where the $500 went. They chase their losses. They lose track of time. They lose perspective on how much they are willing to gamble. All mandatory precommitment does is ensure that people set that number and that the clubs help them stick to it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in the ACT, a trial of mandatory precommitment will be taking place. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, has set up a Trial Oversight Committee that includes representatives from ClubsACT, the Tradies, the ACT Council of Social Service, the ACT Club Managers Association, United Voice, the Australian Institute of Family Studies and the ACT and Australian governments. That committee has been welcomed by participants in this debate. The CEO of ClubsACT, Jeff House, has said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst there is a large body of work that needs to be completed before the trial can commence, the establishment of this Oversight Committee is a key step in the timeline which will allow us to make some initial progress on completing that body of work. I look forward to continuing to work with Minister Macklin and her department.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That commitment to evidence based policymaking is a hallmark of this government.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to something that you often hear from those opposite—that, because Queanbeyan clubs are not affected by mandatory precommitment, such a trial would automatically fail. The thing about this criticism is that it fundamentally misunderstands what mandatory precommitment does. With mandatory precommitment, the government does not set a cap on what you can bet; it asks you to set your own cap. Those opposite suggest that people will flee to Queanbeyan in order to avoid the cap. You do not need to do that. If you think at the outset that you want a higher limit, you set that higher limit yourself. That is the thing about mandatory precommitment. We are helping you to keep the promise that you make to yourself. If you say that you want to stop when you spend $200, we help you to stop when you hit $200. So people are not going to flee to Queanbeyan as a result of this. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is going to happen is that we are going to help people break out of that zone in which they end up spending more than they intended to, go beyond their discretionary income and start spending money that was intended for food, groceries and the kids. You hear some of the most horrendous stories around the impact of problem gambling. One that sticks in my mind is of a little boy who says: 'Dad, could we get a pokie machine at home so Mum can stay at home with us and gamble here?' Those sorts of stories about families that are torn apart by the impact of problem gambling are stories that ought to impel us in this House to act.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that is before the House will ensure that all gaming machines are part of a state-wide precommitment system, and that they display electronic warnings, by 2016—recognising that small venues will need longer implementation time lines. New machines, manufactured or imported, from the end of 2013 will be capable of supporting precommitment. We are placing a limit of $250on ATM withdrawals. And we are making sure that these changes are implemented in conjunction with stakeholders. There will be a Productivity Commission review in 2014 that will assess the progress of the measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am often surprised when those opposite say that we need more evidence on this, because we have a substantial body of evidence, the most important of which is the Productivity Commission's report on problem gambling. What we need to do now is to take the steps to implement that report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased too that we are going to see an Australian Gambling Research Centre that will be run as part of the Australian Institute of Family Studies. Under the leadership of Alan Hayes, the Australian Institute of Family Studies has become a premier policymaking body across social and economic policy. It will be an important part of making sure that we assess the ACT trial and that we continue to evaluate what we are doing in this area. The government's reforms are grounded in the notion of what Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler call 'libertarian paternalism'—that is, we ought not to impose on people any more regulation than is necessary. The thing about libertarian paternalism is that those opposite ought to like this because it is libertarian, because you set the limit yourself. If you want that limit to be $10,000 a month, that is the limit you can set. If you want it to be $200 a month, that is what you set. The paternalism comes from something that you impose on yourself. The paternalism is your ability to say: 'I've got a self-control problem. Don't let me go past what the family's discretionary budget allows. Don't let me spend more than I want to, when I get into the zone at three o'clock in the morning with drinks coming to me and without the perspective of where gambling ought to be in my life.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of Gary Hatcliffe that I told at the outset is one that all of us in this place should bear in mind. Mr Hatcliffe is aware of his challenges. He is aware of his own self-control problem. He is aware that it is only through mandatory precommitment that he will be able to go into a club and enjoy a drink with his mates without again getting caught in the zone.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:08</span>):  I rise tonight to oppose the National Gambling Reform Bill 2012 and cognate bills, this insidious legislation that will deliver no more than what is already out there. Only this Labor government, supported by the member for Denison, would believe that introducing another layer of bureaucratic regulation will cure an addiction. It won't. It is the same as saying to an alcoholic, 'We'll limit you to one drink a day, and that will cure your addiction.' It does not work that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has dealt with people with addictions understands one thing: it is education, information and intervention that address addiction. Only a fool would believe that someone with a serious gambling problem would voluntarily put forward a limit on themselves on how much they will spend. Only a fool would believe that that would restrict them to this one form of gambling, because when they have hit their limit they will then move home to the computer, go on the internet and gamble that way, or they will go to the track and bet on the horses. They might slip down to the SP or down to the TAB. You see, this is incomplete.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a dirty deal that was done to get government. This was a deal that was put to the back blocks and then, when they needed the member for Denison's vote, resurrected again. In fact, it was the minister who said back in May that voluntary precommitment would not work. But here we have this hypocritical move where the legislation has come forward. I just have to wonder: which bill is it that they need the vote of the member for Denison to achieve, for which they have sold out an industry? They are prepared to sell out an industry such as the clubs and hotels to the tune of $1 billion—that is what the cost of this will be—for a vote. That is an expensive little vote—expensive for other people. By the way, it amounts to around a $120 million cost for the clubs and pubs in my electorate of Paterson. It is $120 million in my electorate and $1 billion across Australia that will not be spent upgrading facilities, employing more people—</span>

                    </a>  And that is the critical one, my friend: supporting the charities in the community. It is the football team and all those little sporting events. When somebody has cancer and they need to do a fundraiser, the pubs jump in. They put on the day or the afternoon and they raise the money because they care about their customers and their community. This is an uneven-handed approach.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat in this House when the government wanted to address another form of addiction: binge drinking. They said, 'What we've got to do is get rid of the alcopops by whacking up the tax. If we put up the tax, it'll stop the binge drinking.' They raised $300 million. I cannot remember the last time I saw an ad on the TV, heard one on the radio or read something in the paper on binge drinking from that $300 million that went into consolidated revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They were a government that had a problem with binge spending, which they tried to address by taxing what they thought was binge drinking. By the way, ask any publican how the sales of 750-millilitre bottles of spirits and one-litre Cokes are going. All of a sudden, in that situation, kids that had been drinking a set amount of alcohol per drink were now drinking unregulated mixes of alcohol.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about a gambling addiction; this is a spending addiction, because the government also want to introduce two levies. They want to introduce a federal pokies tax to set up a gambling research centre, and they want to replicate a tax that is being collected by the states. I have long said—and I have said to the hotels and to the clubs—that more needs to be done to have people on the ground doing the work that the Salvos and Vinnies are out there doing now, intervening on a one-on-one basis, identifying the problem and working with people. More needs to be done to use the current systems of voluntary precommitment that exist within these pubs and clubs. This is heavy handed. This is a backdoor way to raise more pokie tax at a federal level, setting up another layer of bureaucracy and penalising those with the skin in the game who are out there working for their community, building businesses and employing people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has introduced a mandatory precommitment trial in the ACT. That trial has not been completed. Where is the matrix of evaluation or the benefits to the community? How many people signed up? How many people actually hit the limit that they put on there?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, this is a rush and bust in a deal that was done for another reason. Our Prime Minister might not remember what she signed when she was a lawyer, but I bet she remembers the deal she signed with the member for Denison, a deal which she broke and which she has now had to resurrect. This Prime Minister did this deal, broke it and put it to the backburner. I say to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities that he probably has a smile on his face because it is probably his bill that he has had to get the member across the line to support, which is why this bill has come back on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that worries me is the limit and location placed on ATMs within venues. Obviously those that decide this legislation have no understanding of what happens in regional and rural country areas in particular, where the ATM in the pub or the club might actually be the bank for the town. Putting a limit on them will affect people's ability to draw cash out to go and buy groceries or petrol or spend as they need to. Importantly for the businesses involved, it has been found that around 70 per cent of money that has been withdrawn from these ATMs is actually spent on food and beverages in those facilities. So putting these caps on will have a negative effect on businesses in the regions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry, in a letter written to the minister by Gaming Technologies Association, has put to the government that what it wants to do with the introduction of these machines will not be able to be completed. A letter dated 22 November by Gaming Technologies Association to the Minster for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs states: 'We write in response to the release of the National Gambling Reform Bill 2012 and the public hearings held last week by the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform. Having had the opportunity to consider and analyse the bill and the evidence presented at the hearing, we write to advise you that the requirements of the bill cannot be met. The bill requires that all new gaming machines must be precommitment capable by 31 December 2013. The definition of "precommitment capable" has been left to regulations, about which formal consultation has not begun.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have put a time line in but they have not said what is required in the regulations. They have said they are going to produce a whole new bureaucracy and there are going to be two levies—not one but two. But there is no costing, nothing set out in the forward estimates, nothing in the explanatory memorandum. The industry does not know how it is going to be taxed by this government. Across Australia, gambling licence fees and taxes are collected by the state governments. That is what needs to remain and those state governments must take responsibility in working with industry to address issues such as problem gambling. Putting it back down to the state government level, they can use some of the taxes they already collect to invest in intervention and education services. The idea of collecting whole new taxes to satisfy a vote required in this parliament from the member for Denison for this hung government, at a cost of over a billion dollars to the industry, is ridiculous to say the least. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gambling can be a problem—it can be a very big problem—and so can alcoholism. They both have effects on the family; they both have effects on the community. But this bill is a voluntary precommitment. There are not too many gambling addicts who are going to line up to set a limit. The issue here, and the one that worries me, is that this precommitment must be linked to a state based data system. I think that is part of the nanny state, and it is a back door entry to mandatory precommitment. I cannot see it as being acceptable. The clubs and the pubs have spoken to members opposite. Indeed, in your role as member for Robertson, Madam Deputy Speaker, I know they have been in touch with you. They are taking this matter very seriously. At the end of the day there is not going to be a lot of upside that is not already being delivered, because there already is voluntary precommitment. But there is going to be a massive cost impact on this industry, and that is unfair.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not intend to delay the House any further. I have made my point. We will oppose this legislation. We will oppose it vehemently. We believe that those that are investing and providing jobs and opportunity in the community deserve to be supported. They cannot be taxed twice on their poker machines—by a state government and a federal government. They cannot have it explained to them that this is about providing good when they are already providing voluntary precommitment. This is just another level of bureaucracy that will not address an addiction one iota; it will not make one measurable difference. It is a shame this government has had to sell out an industry for the sake of a vote.</span>

That will facilitate members who feel that it is important to make a contribution on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill.

In fact, there are about 300,000 people who live on the Central Coast and there are about 340,000 people who are members of clubs in the region. So, obviously, there are quite a few of us who are members of more than one club. That shows that on the Central Coast we have the highest per capita membership of clubs in Australia. Clubs are part of our community. They play a role in sport, in education and in helping out in the community, and they have done so for some time. Unfortunately, they also facilitate and, to a great extent, rely on gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difficult issue that we have before this parliament is how we deal with the people who find it difficult to deal with their addiction to gambling. Over the last couple of years, there has been a great deal of debate in this parliament about what is appropriate, how we should be dealing with it and what measures need to be adopted. In terms of the contributions so far, and I imagine as they continue, there is some right on both sides about this. I agree with some of the coalition members that this is an issue that should be correctly dealt with by state governments, and that is where this naturally falls. But that in itself does not mean that we should not do anything, and there are competing things that need to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My personal view is that we need to be looking at what measures we can take so that clubs and hotels that rely on gambling for their revenue have the time and opportunity to change their business models. It is going to take some time for them to move away from that. Ideally, the best way to do that would be to start reducing the number of poker machines, which is something that is entirely within the purview of state governments. We do not have the power in this parliament to deal with those matters. So, we have to look at how we do deal with this issue and how we deal with people who have a gambling problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation looks at voluntary precommitment by people who identify themselves as having a gambling problem. There are clearly some issues with that, and the most obvious one is—at what stage will someone decide that their problem is serious enough that they will put themselves forward and voluntarily admit that they have a gambling problem. The experience of the industry and people I know personally is that, unfortunately, usually by the time they are prepared to voluntarily say that they have a problem, they have already lost the house, they have already displayed the problems of gambling addition to their children, and there is not much left. It is usually when someone has reached rock bottom that they get to the stage of asking for help. We need to look at whether voluntary precommitment is an appropriate measure to deal with these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was talking to Paul Barnett last week. He is the CEO of the largest club on the Central Coast, the Mingara Recreation Club. They have some 45,000 members and look after over 200 sporting, health and education and welfare groups to whom they contribute over $2 million. While I was quick to praise the work that Mingara does in the community, I also pointed out to Paul that in 10 or 15 years time we cannot have this same conversation about his club doing good work but relying largely on gambling for money; something needs to be done. Mingara is one of those clubs that is prepared to do more than many other institutions that look at gambling. For example, they are already doing an intervention trial at the club with the Salvation Army who are there full-time. It is being monitored and they are seeing how the intervention works. They already have voluntary precommitment on their machines, so they have taken some steps. We then started to talk about some other clubs that have more difficulty, because this is always going to be an issue of weighing up the merits of the potential impact on the club by imposing a form of regulation, as opposed to doing nothing and the cost that that may have for the community. We were able to talk about the Norah Head Bowling Club, which is a small club in my electorate that is having trouble raising the money for resurfacing the bowling green. They have made an application to council for $100,000 which is the cost of that resurfacing. They have estimated that the precommitment technology will cost them five or six times that amount, and they are saying, 'We cannot afford to do our bowling green, which is what we are about; how are we going to be able to do that?' Those are legitimate issues that clubs should be, and are, raising. At the end of the day they have to be balanced against the alternative of, 'Is there a greater good in making sure that there is some intervention there?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those reasons I was looking at moving amendments in relation to the timing of these issues. I understand that the member for New England, who is in the chamber, is going to move such an amendment and it is an amendment that I would support in that it gives a little extra time to make sure that these clubs can balance their expenditure and the costs of bringing this in, and that they are prepared to do that. That is an amendment that I understand the member for New England will be moving and, if he does, it is one that I will support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have some concerns in relation to the timelines for the changeover of the technology for the ATMs. I have seen the government's amendments in relation to that and they certainly meet the concerns I have. They are looking at a one-year period of that coming in as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another concern that I was looking at moving an amendment to involved the cap on the supervisory levy. I am happy to see that the government will be moving amendments in relation to that as well. They are sensible amendments. It is important that the cap be part of the legislation and shown as that, rather than purely being left for the regulations. That is a good move and it is something that I will support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are difficult issues to balance. We all have stories and know about the dangers, the costs and the way in which gambling can rip families and communities apart. The choice that we have in this legislation, particularly in this parliament, is whether we are ever going to be able to get something through that does something to set us on a path for making sure that there is some assistance for this, or whether we are going to continue to argue, disagree, try to make this a political issue of pointscoring and make it an issue that is beyond resolution. I hold the view that we are better to get something, which is why the amendments that I have indicated that the member for New England is going to be putting and the government is going to be putting are amendments that I will be supporting. If I had been able to get support there were more amendments that I think should have been put but, quite simply, I cannot get that support from the crossbenchers or either of the major parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are left with some legislation that is designed to help and assist people who have such a serious problem that governments should intervene to be part of that solution. At the end of having a long think about how and what I should do about this I decided that every member should say that the conclusion that they can reach is that we are better off doing a small amount of good, even if it is not ideal, than to leave this totally alone. I imagine that there are many members like my crossbench colleague in front of me, who would much prefer that a very different approach had been taken. I think we owe it to the Australian community to say that we are putting down a marker here. We are making some changes. They are important changes and they indicate that there is something that this parliament is prepared to do to assist problem gamblers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those reasons I will be supporting the amendments to be moved by the member for New England and the amendments that the government has. If I had been able to get more support there would be other amendments. In the absence of that, I will be supporting the legislation, hopefully, as amended by the very sensible amendments that have been put forward so far.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:36</span>):  The Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 is another ill-conceived, poorly drafted, slapdash piece of legislation rushed into the House. If this was simply some administrative measure for some obscure practice it would not matter so much. But this is about the Murray-Darling Basin. It is going to be a critical part of a plan that has been now lodged as law in this House but is subject to disallowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular piece of legislation is critical to the future of the more than two million people who raise families, grow food and fibre, play, recreate, and wish to have generation after generation working hard there for Australia. The business of this bill underpins the economy of the basin communities and it is about the environment. The explanatory memorandum for this bill does not faithfully echo or mirror the contents. In his second reading speech the minister tried to outline the contents of the bill but what he said was quite different, when you compare it with the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a supplementary member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia when it deals with Murray-Darling Basin issues, and in reviewing the bill last week and this week we had to ask the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to interpret key parts of the bill for us so we knew exactly what it was driving at—the matters were so obscure and so badly drafted.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is this bill all about? What is it attempting to do? Why is it with us? Why has it been rushed into the House? Why did it suddenly appear after the announcement by the Prime Minister at Goolwa in South Australia just a couple of weeks ago? On 29 June 2012, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council commissioned the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to respond to the calls by the South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill to: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">… </span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">complete a ‘relaxed-constraints’ model scenario with a Basin-wide reduction in diversions of 3200 GL/y. The purpose of this scenario is to explore the flow regime changes and potential environmental benefits that would result if some major existing river operating constraints in the southern connected system were relaxed.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That quote was from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority hydrological modelling paper of October 2012. This bill is a consequence of that modelling undertaken at the request of the South Australian Premier. In fact, this bill provides the funding for the acquisition of the additional 450 gigalitres of water the Premier asked for. It is meant to achieve certain outcomes by the removal of the natural constraints that exist in the river.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are these constraints? They include things like the naturally narrow parts of the river, low bridges, levies, dams and storages of fixed volumes. There are roads, railway lines, towns and private farmland. There are all sorts of constraints, and this bill is all about how they can be removed in order to get that extra water pushed down the river to supposedly help with the environmental condition of some environmental assets which are listed amongst examples in the bill itself. That is quite an unusual situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not surprised at all that the previous speaker on this bill—the member for Makin; a South Australian member—was so excited about this bill, because it is all about South Australia. I love South Australia. I am sure everyone in Australia appreciates some of the good things that happen there, but the fact is that the basin includes Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. There are ecosystem assets, Ramsar listed sites and other wetlands throughout that basin. This is about more than keeping the mouth of the Murray open nine years out of 10. This has to be about more than increasing the depth of water at the mouth of the River Murray. It has to be about more than increasing the depth of water in the Lower Lakes. But we are told that these are the reasons why the extra 450 gigalitres of water has to be pushed down the rivers—the Murray in particular and the other major tributaries that are interconnected in the southern part of the basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Basin Authority was nervous about this, and they make it clear in their paper on the hydrological modelling of the relaxation of operational constraints. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The removal of some of these constraints may lead to increased flow peaks further downstream, which may create nuisance flooding on privately held land. If this were to be pursued in reality (rather than in modelled scenarios), it is likely that governments would approach this by negotiation of easements. Assessing the downstream implications of managing higher flow rates from a flooding perspective will require detailed hydrodynamic modelling of the river system, and was not within the scope of this work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am afraid we do not have detailed hydrological modelling of what this massive increase in the volume of water would do to the communities and ecosystems that would be flooded deliberately and in a calculated way. So despite that statement—that pleading statement—from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, here we are with this bill being debated tonight. We are to add another 450 gigalitres on top of the 2,750 remaining gigalitres to be found for the environment, according to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are we going to do about this? It is incredible that despite the absence of detailed hydrological modelling we are supposed to simply suck it up. It is quite unrealistic to expect that the $1.7 billion—the additional money—which is to be appropriated, will cover the costs of the range of projects including acquisition of flood easements, provision of access works—for example, raising bridges and culverts—changing watering regimes and increased outlet capacity on major dams and storages. That is what that money is supposed to do. It is also supposed to compensate all of those who will find themselves in the pathway of these man-made and additional floods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a hearing on Friday on the impacts of this bill and there were pleadings from those in the southern part of the basin in particular who will be flooded as a consequence of these extra gigalitres. Mrs Jan Beer, who lives around Seymour on the upper Goulburn said, under the sworn conditions of a parliamentary hearing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am very concerned that federal politicians are about to vote on a bill allowing increased environmental flows, with no constraints, down the Goulburn River system, when absolutely no studies or investigations of any consequence have taken place to know whether this is even possible without flooding freehold landowners and businesses on a very regular basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That flooding would occur every 2½ years or every four years out of 10. This would create far-reaching implications such as changing the natural flooding region of the Goulburn tributaries. I believe that Prime Minister Gillard and Minister Burke are dreaming. They are in fantasy land. The proposal to send increased environmental flows down the Goulburn River under the relaxed constraints policy—to deliver 40,000 megalitres a day at McCoys bridge for an average duration of four days every 2½ years—and not exceed minor flood level, simply cannot be done. I repeat: it cannot be done without creating floods well in excess of minor flood levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to explain further the horrific consequences for those in the Goulburn valley. Flooding is not just a problem of loss of livestock, loss of livelihood, loss of housing and loss of infrastructure. In our very flat part of the world, particularly in my electorate of Murray, flooding lies on and in the landscape for months if not years. The floods that occurred naturally some two years ago are still seen in our landscape in the form of low-lying areas under inundation. That causes salinity problems, it causes significant issues with blue-green algae and, ultimately, it is a problem for weeds and a problem for loss of biodiversity. Red gums in particular and box trees do not like their feet wet for long periods of time. So this is also an environmental hazard. It would be a serious problem for us if this bill were in fact carried through as it proposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The practical implication of constraints removal are real and come with various costs. They are demonstrated, for example, at McCoy Bridge. This was evidence given by the Victorian Farmers Federation at another Senate inquiry just very recently. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is nonsense to say that you can push 40,000 mega litres a day passed McCoy Bridge—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that is one of the outcomes we are told to expect—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a serious business. What democratically elected government of a developed country would deliberately set about flooding farmland, infrastructure and towns, causing environmental damage, for an outcome that they refer to in the act as greater depth of the channel of the flow of the water out to sea at the end of the Murray and for deeper water in some of those lakes?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know about the myths and legends to do with not touching any of the engineered barrages and other infrastructure that currently does not allow the estuarine conditions to influence the mouth of the Murray in South Australia. We know that this is a sacred cow. We are not supposed to talk about it out loud. The realities are if you actually apply engineering common sense to support the Lower Lakes and let the natural Murray River flood flows into them then you will achieve better outcomes without having to flood the upper reaches or the middle reaches of the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition amendments, which our shadow minister pre-empted at the beginning of this debate, stressed that the bill also fails to make it absolutely clear that any water found would not simply come from non-strategic general water buyback. We know from Minister Burke's remarks that he now understands the damage done, first by Minister Penny Wong and then from his own time as minister, with non-strategic water buybacks. We now have stranded assets and we have higher costs for irrigators tipping some of them out of the business. This bill, we are told, is not meant to take more water for this environmental flow out of irrigators' pockets, but it is not clear in the bill at all. The amendments of the coalition would try to make that clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make something else absolutely clear. As far as the people of northern Victoria are concerned, the source of the 450 extra gigalitres is a problem, but it is the impacts of the deliberate, calculated, man-made flooding that will wipe out their futures. That extra water will also not add to the environmental amenity or the sustainability of the Murray River, the Goulburn River, the Murrumbidgee River and the other tributaries that are to be given much greater flows in order to push that extra water down the river. I could quote many more local people, like Mr Ian Lobban, who also gave evidence last Friday to a Senate committee. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have employed a certified practising valuer to look at the impact that this will have on properties. The figures to hand so far have indicated quite clearly that properties are already devalued by one-third, and that is a considerable loss of asset value. In a lot of cases it is people's superannuation. In our vicinity of the river we estimate that the compensation would be in the vicinity of $53 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He is talking about the compensation if those man-made floods were made to occur at the timing that the bill implies. This is a serious problem for our Murray-Darling Basin. It is bad enough that we have the Murray-Darling Basin Plan now as law if we cannot in fact have it disallowed. That bill is deeply flawed. It is a bill that does not rest on decent modelling. It does not rest on good science. It is not a bill that has a triple bottom line principle attached to it. It does not deliver environmental, social, community or economic outcomes in equal measure. The plan is deeply flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As most people know in this place, I intend to try to disallow the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I also object to this bill. This bill is a nonsense. It is an absurdity. It destroys the environment at the same time as it absolutely destroys the futures of people who have to anticipate a man-made flood pushed down the river every couple of years, with their bridges raised so the water can get under them. What is the point of raising the bridges if the land all around is inundated, with dams and storages apparently made bigger so that more water can be captured and pushed down the streams so that the mouth of the Murray is deeper? It is a nonsense. This bill is another example of a government that is incompetent or simply does not care.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:51</span>):  It will be no surprise that I support the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012. This bill does have a triple bottom line, and I will explain that to the House. Each and every community throughout the Murray-Darling Basin and beyond will see in this debate whether their MP supports the triple bottom line—the win-win-win scenario so often sought in this issue but so infrequently achieved. We have here such an outcome on offer—an outcome which will achieve the three objectives of protecting the Murray-Darling environment, maintaining economic development and industry and sustaining communities dependent on a healthy river system. This bill will, with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, deliver that triple bottom line—and it is affordable. So, there is no excuse for not supporting this bill. Only those who oppose reform for opposition's sake or spite will oppose this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the first point—the environment—this bill delivers water which is absolutely needed to reach those parts of our Murray-Darling environment that are typically dependent on larger floods to keep them alive; those wetlands and forests which are central to the health of the greater river system and which are not catered for in any shape or form by the mooted Murray-Darling Basin Plan's 2,750 gigalitre compromise. The additional 450 gigalitres, when added to the 2,750 gigalitres expected to be within the plan, represents a win for the environment and the health of this tremendously important river basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the second point—economic activity—this bill will use water sourced from water savings. This is not water currently being used by farmers or industry but water that is currently being lost to the system—wasted, blown, squandered, evaporated et cetera. Water currently lost to both farms and the river will be saved by federal infrastructure spends and only half of the water saved will be returned to the environment. The farms get to keep the rest. The farmers win, the environment wins and everyone, everything, is better off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the third point, with farmers increasing their effective water supply, communities will be able to better sustain their local economies and the social vitality of their regions. As I said, this is the epitome of the triple bottom line and that result is realised in this bill. Why would anyone want to oppose the bill?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The subject matter contained in this bill was made public by the Prime Minister on her recent visit to South Australia. Some from Victoria and New South Wales will ask, 'Why South Australia?' A number of the key Murray-Darling icon sites that we have heard so much about are in South Australia and each of them has been battling to get, at best, some prospect of recovery from the degradation of the millennium drought. These sites include the Lower Lakes, the Coorong and the Murray mouth. These are collectively an icon site as determined by the Liberal-National Party under the 2004 National Water Initiative. The National Water Initiative is held up by those opposite as being evidence of the Howard government having regard for our river systems. Yet we hear today a view different from that. In the same breath as they applaud the National Water Initiative, members of the opposition coalition, as we have just heard, dismiss the significance of these assets and the claim for enough of the water of the Murray-Darling Basin to keep them in a good state of health. Members opposite say one thing but mean another. The opposition say they uphold the principles of the National Water Initiative, so they really should support the objectives of the National Water Initiative—to protect these icon sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another icon site which, under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan as negotiated between the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the states, would not have a hope of surviving—the Chowilla Floodplain, which straddles the Victoria-South Australia border. This is another icon site which the opposition's favourite National Water Initiative held up for saving but which the opposition now want to see dead. The Chowilla Floodplain is a large area which is more elevated from the River Murray's water level than many wetlands. It takes a flood to get water up and over the banks and across the floodplain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite its best efforts, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority was not able to include this icon site as a beneficiary of its proposed 2,750 gigalitre compromise plan. The particular problem with Chowilla is that there is so much salt beneath the soil. Without watering from flood, this salt rises through the soil and enters the root zone, killing the forests and a range of other vegetation in the area. The salt rises and enters the topsoil, and from there it enters the streams and eventually the Murray itself. Without watering to keep the salt deep in the ground, we end up with a wasteland of death and salt that will enter and kill the river system. Chowilla needs to be watered not just for its own health but for the health of the wider environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the compromised plan's 2,750 gigalitres is not enough to water this icon site. It would die. This leads to the purpose of this bill. The additional 450 gigalitres, added to the 2,750 gigalitres, will give the Murray-Darling Basin Authority the weight to water the Chowilla Floodplain and force the salt down, saving not only the floodplain itself with the benefits that brings but also the river system, in which salt is a constant problem requiring constant attention and effort to remove. Without this bill, Chowilla dies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just a South Australian issue, as the icon site spans the border shared with Victoria. This is not just an issue for South Australia and Victoria, as saving this stretch of the river and beyond is required by national law—it is an issue for all of us and action is required by law. If members of the coalition stand by the intent of the National Water Initiative, if they stand by the intent of the Water Act as proposed by the Howard government, I would like them to stand up and tell the Australian people whether or not they support the National Water Initiative as a whole, or just the river's icon sites in the eastern states. I would like them to stand up in this place and inform the Australian public that they support John Howard's plan for the Murray-Darling Basin as it pertains to New South Wales alone, or that they support John Howard's national plan for Victoria only. This bill amends the Water Act 2007 to provide a secure funding stream to enable up to an additional 450 gigalitres of water to be recovered for the environment to ease or remove constraints and to deliver environmental water without having a negative impact on the social or economic future of the communities of the Murray-Darling Basin. The bill complements the Water Amendment (Long-term Average Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2012, introduced into the parliament in September 2012. That bill facilitates the adjustment of the long-term sustainable diversion limit under the Basin Plan within clearly set limits and with a clearly defined process to provide transparency to this parliament and the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amounts credited to the account may be debited for purposes including: improving the water efficiency of infrastructure, such as on-farm irrigation efficiency programs; improving or modifying infrastructure that constrains the delivery of environmental water in order to ease or remove those constraints, increasing the capacity of dams and storages to deliver environmental water, and entering into easements or agreements; purchasing water access rights and making payments in relation to projects whose aim is to further the objects of this bill; and, of course, addressing any detrimental social or economic impact on the wellbeing of any community in the Murray-Darling Basin that is associated with a project as mentioned above so as to offset any such impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of the proposed funding will be directed towards continuing and increasing existing programs, especially the On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program. The proposed funds will also enable increased environmental water to be delivered to wetlands by easing or removing constraints—for example, increasing the outflows from storage dams, raising a bridge and improving other infrastructure, and, importantly, providing for flood easements or agreements with landholders. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:01</span>):  As I rise to speak on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012, I hold in my hand the proof committee <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, which runs to 33 pages,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>of the hearing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, which inquired into the bill, on Tuesday, 20 November 2012. I inform the House that the member for New England, who is the chair of that committee; the ALP member for Bendigo; the Liberal member for Murray; and I as the Nationals member for Riverina were in attendance at that hearing and we took evidence from a number of witnesses, following the submissions that were sent in to us, to discuss this very important bill. Certainly, people took a lot of time on their submissions to the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was referred to the Regional Australia committee on 1 November. The reason for the referral was that the bill commits future parliaments to appropriating $1.77 billion. This is an unusual approach which deserved scrutiny by the committee, given its impact on the budget—and we know how important the budget is. We know how important it is for the future of Australia and we certainly know how important it is to the future of Labor in government, which at this point in time has not delivered a budget in surplus since 1989. The committee received 16 submissions and undertook a public hearing, as I said, on 20 November. The submissions were tabled and we took evidence from a number of people at that hearing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To my way of thinking, the fact that tonight we have put aside the adjournment debate because the Leader of the House has opted to exhaust the list of speakers on this bill makes a mockery, really, of what the Regional Australia committee members were trying to achieve. We read the submissions, we listened to the evidence at that hearing and we had a meeting just this afternoon to discuss our recommendations. We have had a series of meetings since the hearing. We have discussed it in this parliament amongst ourselves. We have exchanged telephone calls. We have done all that to come to a set of three recommendations, and the wording of those recommendations was the subject of considerable debate. We had agreed that, in the morning, we would finalise the actual wording and report back to the parliament, for the benefit of members, the standing committee's recommendations, which would affect this bill. But tonight we are exhausting the speakers list and tomorrow, the Leader of the Government tells me, we will vote on it. So members will vote on the bill with all the speakers having spoken on it but without the benefit of knowing what the Standing Committee on Regional Australia's recommendations are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After all that—the 16 submissions that were made by people in good faith, and the evidence that was given in good faith last week in Sydney by environmental groups, farming groups and irrigators—I wonder: what was the point of it? What was the point of it when tonight we are being told to hurry up our speeches and to get all this debate out of the way? For what? The members cannot take a vote without the informed recommendations of the Regional Australia committee. The Independent member for New England keeps the Labor government in power, but what must he think? His committee have spent hours and hours on this inquiry and have deliberated on the bill, and taxpayer money was spent on all of us to travel to Sydney to hear the evidence—for what? We heard the evidence and we made recommendations, and those recommendations will be, what, just tabled in parliament? I cannot see for what purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What should have happened is that there should have been enough time to table the recommendations. Members on both sides of the House would have benefited from being able to read the recommendations, and we would have been able to vote on the bill based on those recommendations. It is all lip-service, as is typical of this government. Had it not been for the passion and pride shown by those who live in the Coleambally and Murrumbidgee irrigation areas at the original meeting with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, the public rally on 14 October 2010, this whole water debate would have headed in a different direction, because it was at that meeting that 7,000 locals told the MDBA that they were not going to watch their communities be destroyed by a bad guide to a draft of the plan without a proper environmental watering plan and without proper scientific validation. Had it not been for those 7,000 people turning up and telling the MDBA that they needed to go back and rethink this, the minister for regional Australia and the minister for water would not have charged the Independent member for New England with the responsibility of heading the House Standing Committee on Regional Australia's look into the MDBA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did that and we produced a fine report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Of drought and flooding rains: inquiry into the impact of the</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan</span>, which itself produced 21 really worthwhile recommendations. It talked about buyback. It talked about the patchwork economy that we are in, but also about the 'Swiss cheese effect' of which the member for New England constantly reminded members in this House. It talked about the need for water savings infrastructure to be put in on farm, and for environmental works and measures to ensure that the water recovery was such that it did not have an impact on those regional communities which grow fibre and food to feed our nation and, indeed, other nations as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, we produced a really good report. It was produced in May 2011. Yet it took until the last sitting day of last year for the water minister to come into this place and actually acknowledge the fact that that report had been delivered. I do truly believe that that only happened after I implored the minister for regional Australia that this should be so. Yet, still, those 21 recommendations have not been followed through.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the three recommendations that our committee has made—which are being worked on as we speak and will be finalised in the morning—we made them for what? The members will not have the benefit of those informed submissions, the benefit of that informed hearing that we had in Sydney, and the benefit of those people who took the time and trouble to actually give us evidence—and that is the environmental groups, too—and tell us what they thought about this particular bill, which is now going to be voted on in the morning after the speakers list has been exhausted tonight. Well, that is a disgrace. It makes a mockery of the democracy we are supposed to be upholding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within hours of that meeting ending at Griffith, as I say, the member for New England was given charge of it and the Standing Committee on Regional Australia was set up. And we have done some great work. We went right around—we met in 12 regional centres in four states, with the largest attendance, apart from the hearing in Griffith on 25 January 2011, being 70 at Deniliquin on the previous day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Griffith and the people I serve are understandably concerned. Only last week I told some locals in Griffith that, had the Prime Minister, on 26 October when she made the big announcement in Goolwa, in good faith come to Griffith and said: 'I am going to set aside, as the Prime Minister of this country, a special account of water for South Australia, but I am going to do it just through works and measures. I am going to do it with a special fund that I'm going to set aside. It's going to cost $1.77 billion. I have not actually worked out how I am going to fund that. I know how you people work hard, and I acknowledge the fact that your area of Griffith is celebrating its centenary of irrigation. So, after this meeting in Griffith, I am going to go to Goolwa and announce this special fund,' I think the people of Griffith might have thought, 'Well, you know, the water's going to come out of works and measures—it's not going to come from further buyback; it's going to be coming from a special water account fund,' I think they might have accepted it. I think they might have thought, 'The Prime Minister has come here in good faith; we should listen to her; we should go along with what she says.' But no—absolutely playing the politics, the Prime Minister went to South Australia and said: 'I've saved the ailing Murray! I've done that.' She had the minister for water there, and they both took credit for saving the ailing Murray.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you that some of the river red gums in my part of the world are actually dying, drowning, through too much water. We heard Senator Sarah Hanson-Young going on about the river red gums dying through a lack of water. Well, I would like to know where they are dying, because many of the river red gums and many of the trees have been underwater for so long, due to the last two floods that we have had in the Riverina, that they have actually got too much water. I would love to know how the government is planning to put more water down the system when—and we heard the member for Murray talk about the low-lying areas in her electorate—there are parts of my electorate which have been underwater since March, and the people of Darlington Point are fearing that, with the amount of water that we are proposing to put down the river, they could be permanently underwater. That simply is not good enough in a country which says that it is going to look after its people, particularly its regional people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been put forward, and I have signed a disallowance motion with the member for Murray. I stand by doing that. But, as I say, all Australians want a healthy river system. We cannot survive without this happening. Regional cities and towns along the rivers also know we desperately need a Basin Plan with a focus not solely on environmental outcomes but also with economic and social implications taken into consideration. And we do not have that at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister needs to know that no region has been more interested in, passionate about and vocal in the Basin Plan deliberations than my electorate of the Riverina. This is because the Riverina people have the most to lose if too much productive water—that which is used to grow food and fibre—is lost to the local area through buybacks. And I am so pleased that the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, this morning made his strongest statement yet that buyback in a Basin Plan under a future coalition government—and, God willing, that will happen next year—would be capped at 1,500 gigalitres, because that will mean that only 249 gigalitres are still to be recovered through buybacks. Over the years, I think the irrigation communities can wear that. Certainly we cannot take buybacks totally off the table because there are some irrigation farmers who want to sell their water. But too often in the past we have seen the other side of politics talking about buying water from willing sellers when they have actually been debt-pressured sellers. They really did not want to sell their water, but they had to because they were pressured by banks and because the Labor government, the biggest irrigator in the country, had gone into the marketplace and was paying over the odds for water. Why wouldn't an irrigator want to sell his or her water if they were due to retire, their kids did not want to take up the farm and there is money being offered to do it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, the Burrinjuck and Blowering dams, which produce a lot of hydroelectricity and hold a lot of irrigation productive water, are almost chock-a-block full of water. If we put too much more environmental water into the system, there is not going to be any air space; the dams are full as it is. Unfortunately, when we experience floods, as we have for the past couple of years, we then experience the typical environmental flows going into an already flooded Murrumbidgee Valley, which is just what we do not need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, in her 3 May 2012 speech to the Global Foundation summit in Melbourne, spoke of strengthening irrigation. Her more recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the Asian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">entury</span> white paper also acknowledged the huge role Australia has to fulfil regarding the global food task in the years ahead. I commend the Prime Minister for making those statements, because they are true. But she knows as well as anyone that Australia is best placed geographically, economically and agriculturally, with our agricultural industry already well established, to more than meet the growing food demand in Asia. But we cannot do it if we do not give our farmers productive water and we cannot do if we set up special accounts for South Australia. Why isn't there a special account for the Riverina? It has already had 368 gigalitres bought out of it, more than any other place in the basin. It is just totally unfair. My people will not keep copping this, let me tell you. I would like to see the Prime Minister come to Griffith and explain to them the Basin Plan and acknowledge the great job that they do on behalf of this nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="YT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:16</span>):  It is a great pleasure to follow the member for Riverina on this Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012. This reform of the Murray and the Darling river systems has gone back a long time in history. It is not something that only this government has been dealing with. In fact, I well recall John Anderson, the former Deputy Prime Minister and the former member for Gwydir, introducing the National Water Initiative, which was instrumental in starting a very credible process that not only was designed to deal with reform of water and ensure environmental flows within the Murray-Darling Basin system but also acknowledged that we have got to look after the communities where there is a water buyback or a loss of allocation and what that might mean to some of the regional economies along the Murray-Darling system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, I put a submission in to the initial inquiry by this government. One of the points I raised was that the Murray and the Darling are two ecologically different systems. The Murray is in southern Australia and it comes from more of a Mediterranean type climate. A lot of the water comes from winter rainfall patterns and it also comes from a lot of melting snow. I represent the seat of Maranoa, which has the entire Condamine-Balonne river system, the Warrego River system and the Paroo River system within its boundaries. They are all part of what we call the Murray-Darling Basin catchment area. I also have within my electorate the border rivers of the Macintyre, the Weir and the Moonie. The Macintyre is one that I share with my good friend Mark Coulton, the member for Parkes.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BRUCE SCOTT:</span>
                    </a>  Indeed, as the member for Bowman says—but it extends further back. It goes right back to the headwaters of the Macintyre system and the Severn system, which comes right up into the back of Stanthorpe. I know that at Stanthorpe, for the last 20 years, they have been searching for ways to be able to get more water to secure the horticultural production that is so important not only to the food source in Australia but also for the export effort that goes into the products that are produced in the Stanthorpe and the Southern Downs Regional Council area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a very real concern that, whilst a large part of the bill that we have before the House—and the works and measures and the proposed buybacks of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—has much support from this side of the House and many of my producers, there are still very real concerns that there is not science backing up the issue of the quantum of water in relation to buybacks nor is there any research or regional impact study that has been done on where that water is proposed to be bought from. That is a very real concern. In the Lower Balonne region in my electorate, I know that the government want to buy back some 100 gigalitres. They have already bought 35 gigalitres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Riverina said, there are farmers who will sell water for all sorts of purposes. We understand that, but what we must understand is that when water is purchased from a region there can be a regional impact on the economy of that area. There has not been the research done to satisfy me nor many of my constituents, whether it is concerning the Macintyre, the border rivers, the Condamine or the Balonne river systems in my electorate. In fact, they are telling me in the Lower Balonne that, if 100 gigalitres is purchased, it will equate to 25 per cent of the total allocation in that part of the Condamine-Balonne river system. They say they can live with the 35 gigalitres that has already been purchased and at this point it is not having any impact on the regional economy. But they tell me that if the government does buy up to 100 gigalitres—in other words, the other 65 gigalitres—it will inevitably have an impact on the regional economy of that part of the Condamine-Balonne river system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also point out at this juncture that in Queensland we have been through an exhaustive process for the last 10 to 15 years in relation to water allocation management plans and the resource operational plans that have been done by state governments. In the Condamine-Balonne river system, 15 per cent of the allocations were given back to the environment as part of that process without compensation. They moved from the older type allocation systems to an events based process of allocation—the 'event' meaning the time of the year and the flow in the river, which determined how much water you would be able to extract at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in my community and many of my irrigators are exhausted at this process that has gone on for so long. It creates a great deal of uncertainty in the communities. It does not give confidence to business to invest in the region. What they are saying to me in relation to buybacks is they want a cap on the buybacks, that there will be no more buybacks without the science being presented to the community so they can understand. They are prepared to look at good science, as they did with the ROPs and the WAMP allocation process, where they moved to an events based allocation rather than the older type where they just had an allocation from the river systems. So they want to see the science that underpins the buybacks. They want to see more work done and they do support the works and measures money, because out of efficiency you can get a win-win situation. You can get water for the environment. As a result of that, you can also make the use of that water more efficient, which gives both a dividend to the farmer and a benefit to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have little time tonight, and I am disappointed that the government want to see this going through here tonight. As outlined by the member for Riverina, there has been a House Standing Committee on Regional Australia inquiry going on and we have not seen the report tabled in this place, which we should have seen before this final bill was presented for consideration by members on both sides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Border Rivers Food and Fibre group have said to me—and they have said it to the state ministers on both sides of the border—that they still believe that the Basin Plan remains unacceptable in its current form. I have outlined some of the concerns that they have. They see that, as I said in my original submission, the northern part of the Murray-Darling system—in other words, the Darling system—should be considered separately from the Murray system. I outlined earlier in my remarks tonight the reasons why. They believe there should be a completely separate Basin Plan. I reflect those comments on behalf of Border Rivers Food and Fibre. Before any further buybacks are conducted, they want to see the science that underpins why that water is needed, where it will be delivered and where it will be bought from within the system. These are all very, very real concerns that Border Rivers Food and Fibre have, whether it is the Macintyre River system, the Condamine-Balonne or even the Warrego system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was out in the Warrego only 10 days ago, talking to the irrigators. There is very limited irrigation there at the moment. It is a very arid area but there is limited irrigation, particularly for high-value crops such as grapes and melons and some organic production of cereal grains. When we went through the water allocation management plans for the Warrego some seven or eight years ago, 8,000 megalitres was given back to the environment without any compensation for the impact that the loss of that water from the Warrego would have on the economic activity in the Warrego business areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that the producers in my electorate will work with a good plan. They still believe the science does not underpin the 1,500 gigalitres that the government wants to buy. They are concerned that there is no assessment of the regional impact, the cost of the buyback and what it would mean to some of those communities if they lost that volume of water in those areas. That should be done before any buyback occurs so it can be explained to the community and a package of measures put in place to ensure that there is no loss of economic activity in that part of the basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say tonight that I am disappointed that this government has decided that they want to see this bill passed tonight, in the last sitting week of this year—almost rammed through this place. It is such an important issue. It has gone on for many years—in fact, decades. In Queensland we have been going through this at a state level and now at the federal level for 10 to 15 years. Farmers do want to be part of the solution. They want to work for an outcome that is sustainable and will mean greater security for their business operations and also no loss of economic activity in their business areas.</span>

This is an issue which has plagued our country since Federation. This is one of the last acts in a too-long debate to fix a mistake of the Federation. This issue should never have been left to the state governments to handle because this is an issue that will always divide the states, but particularly it will always divide water catchment areas. We have just heard another member talk with passion and belief about his water catchment areas and the people in them he represents. We have heard representatives from other water catchment areas this evening representing irrigation districts. We will hear more, I am sure, during this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I remind those in the House that this plan, when it eventually passes the parliament in the coming days, will undoubtedly have an effect on different economies throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. I also remind the House, the member for Maranoa and others who have spoken that some of those irrigation districts did not get a choice. That is often forgotten. There seems to be some unique distinction between the irrigation districts that get a choice about how they adjust structurally to a change in the economy and those where it is forced upon them, where all of a sudden the water has just dried up. The fact is that the history of this debate is long because it is splintered. The reason that we have differences of views on this side of the House, particularly, is that we have representatives from throughout the basin, which those on the other side do not have, and the communities will never, ever come to an agreement on this issue. It does not matter whether you are a South Australian, a Victorian, a New South Welshman or a Queenslander; what really matters is if you are from one irrigation district or another. I grew up in Mildura, which is in Victoria, in the Sunraysia irrigation district. I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that those in Mildura when I was growing up used to look down the river at people in the electorate of Indi and say: 'Those people misuse water. Those people are inefficient users of water.' They would also say that people in the electorate of Farrer misused water. Equally, people in my electorate, at the end of the system, on the Lower Lakes, point all the way up the system and say, 'They all misuse water.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Wentworth, who was the water minister when this process began—nearly six years ago, on Australia Day 2007—under Prime Minister John Howard, often said that, no matter where you were in the basin, you would hear the words: 'Those people upstream misuse water,' and, 'Be darned with the people downstream.' When you are on the Lower Lakes in South Australia, there are not too many people downstream to not worry about. There are plenty of people upstream you can blame, and they often are blamed—very often unfairly. But, at the end of the day, this is a responsibility that should be with a federal independent authority. That was the policy that was announced in January 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not surprised that the member for Maranoa says that he has had contact from constituents today who have said that they do not agree with this plan. I am not surprised by that at all. I am sure the member for Riverina had those contacts right up to the moment he spoke, and I respect that. But you will never get agreement. What the people in my electorate think is a good plan will not be thought of as a good plan in the electorates of Maranoa, Indi or Riverina. The reason this issue is 120 years old is that we cannot come to an agreement. We have to hand this to a group of people who look at the best available science. And again I disagree with the member for Maranoa: there is lots of science available. It might be disagreed with by different people—different stakeholders and different irrigation districts—but there is plenty of science available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This plan is a negotiated settlement, undoubtedly. I have got some time for the minister and the effort that he has put in, and particularly for the chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. I acknowledge the contribution of someone from the other side of politics. When he was appointed, I was suspicious about that appointment, I must say, but nonetheless I think he has done a terrific job in engaging with those communities that will be affected. But the idea that any minister—whether it be the member for Wentworth when he first started this plan, or the current minister, or any minister since Federation—could somehow bring these disparate interests together and get complete agreement is really dancing in fairyland. It really is. Inevitably, we need a system of management which is outside this place, which is outside the state governments, particularly, and which is outside the irrigation districts—because ultimately we will never get agreement.</span>
                </p>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  Please don't worry. Just give your speech. I'm not fussed. Don't lose the flow of your thought. It's not worth it!</span>

                    </a>  The minister in question time today raised a point which I could not agree with more, and that was when he pointed out the utter, complete and disgraceful hypocrisy of the Australian Greens. If nothing else proves that that group of people are in it for nothing other than to be a protest party, then this bill and this plan prove it. The disgraceful behaviour of the Australian Greens, particularly when representing South Australia, is something that they should have on their tombstone as a political organisation. The senator from South Australia who is the water spokesperson for the Australian Greens cannot see that, after 120 years and after nearly six years of this debate in this parliament, this is the opportunity for South Australia to adopt a plan and for this parliament to adopt a plan for the first time since Federation to correct the mistake of Federation. That they would rather play cheap, partisan politics to try and differentiate themselves in South Australia from the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia is shameful. It is a disgrace. It will stay on their tombstone as a political party forever, in my view. And I will make sure that my electorate knows very well that the only people in this parliament, the only self-interested organisation in this parliament, not representing their own electorates with the passions of their own irrigation districts on their side, who tried to stop this from becoming law, were the Australian Greens and, shamefully, a senator from South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disgrace that they have taken the position that they have taken, purely for politics, purely to try and differentiate themselves so that next year the very slim hope that that senator has of holding onto her position in the Senate will somehow be enhanced by this position that she has taken and her party has taken today. I say to this House: it will diminish the Australian Greens in South Australia. It will diminish them greatly, because any right-minded South Australian will know that the campaign that the Premier of South Australia has played over the last 12 months has been about politics. This bill is in part about politics, undoubtedly. I say that, but this bill really is about aims in five or six years time, and this is not really the big debate. The big debate is to ensure that we get, for the first time since Federation, an independent national authority to lay out a plan for the management of the basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe in the reform of the Murray-Darling Basin. I always have. I grew up in the Murray-Darling Basin. My parents still live in Mildura, in the middle of the Murray-Darling Basin. I represent people along the Lower Lakes who have been affected in the most devastating way. Down on the Lower Lakes, they have been used—and I am sure the minister will acknowledge this—over many years as political props in this debate. There are people like Henry Jones, who I have the utmost respect for, who has fought for this since 1983, when he stood at the Lower Lakes as they silted up for the first time. Mind you, Madam Speaker, the water allocations increased exponentially after that drought, when we did not realise that there might have been a problem and the system was telling us that there might have been a problem. Henry Jones has fought every day of his life since that time. He is a fisherman on the Lower Lakes. He did not want to spend his life fighting for this, but he has. He should be and he will be acknowledged, I am sure. There are people like Kym McHugh, the Mayor of Alexandrina Council, the council whose district is along Lower Lakes, who saw the devastation of his community during 2006, 2007 and 2008, when you could walk out most of the way through the Lower Lakes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Droughts will happen, and they will come again. But the issue with the last drought—and this cannot be denied—was that the system went into the drought stressed. It went into the drought with a lack of water in it to cope with what in the end was a more significant event than anyone predicted. I believe that these reforms and the reforms that were started in 2001 by the Howard government, working with the states to put water back into the system to address the overallocation crisis, will ensure that, the next time a significant drying event occurs, the system is able to manage in a much better way than it did last time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, we are making a judgement here on which environmental assets we decide can survive, because we want to continue to produce the food and fibre from the basin. Of course we do. My producers in my area want to continue to produce. They want access to water. They do not want those five years where they could not get a drop of water, where that structural change that the member for Maranoa was talking about just before, which has been debated in his area now, was forced upon them, where they woke up one morning and they had to drag the pumps out that extra 10 metres to the further part of the Lower Lakes to desperately try and get their legal water entitlement, which we have heard so much about from so many other members. No-one asked them if that was okay. But somehow, as irrigators, they do not seem to be as important to some people in this debate as others. Of course, that highlights why we need this reform, why I support this reform in the strongest possible terms. I started my first speech in this place on this reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sick of the politics of this debate. I am sick of having to speak on this issue every couple of months. I look forward to the moment when we get through a year without having to talk about the Murray-Darling Basin, when we can address the issues and ensure that the food producers, who are so important to our country and to our future, who stand at the doorway of such great opportunities, are able to get on with certainty, knowing what their water entitlements will be into the future. That is why the urgency of this is important. That is why this parliament should deal with this bill. That is why the parliament should endorse in the strongest possible terms this plan, because it was a process which was started in January 2007; it is a process which has taken far too long to implement. But it is here, it is before us and it is time for us to act. It is time for us to deliver this plan. We will play the politics as we may, as members on the other side have done tonight and as some on our side have done, no doubt. In the end, for the good of the system, to ensure the sustainability of our food-producing areas not just today but tomorrow, I say to this parliament: once and for all, let's get on with this reform to the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is undoubtedly a difficult issue. It is very hard for many people in this place. But that just sums up why, in the end, we need this reform. We need it desperately. We need it to pass the parliament tonight so that we can get on with ensuring the certainty that is required by irrigation districts throughout the Murray-Darling Basin, ensuring the sustainability of the basin into the future. That is why I thoroughly endorse the plan before the parliament. I argue to the House that this bill should be passed. Even though it is not the most important piece of legislation relating to the basin, I would still say that this bill should pass as proposed and in conjunction with the plan that should be endorsed before we leave this place this week.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:42</span>):  I am pleased to speak tonight on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012. This bill is separate from the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which of course is not a piece of legislation before this House but a disallowable instrument. But this bill is intricately connected with the plan and, in talking about this bill, I will of course pick up some remarks about the plan itself. It has been a process that has been exhaustive for everyone in the basin. I want to talk about the lived experience of my constituents in the electorate of Farrer, which represents most of the Murray River in New South Wales and most of the Darling River in New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start by saying that on the weekend, as I sometimes do, I flew my small plane—licensed and dangerous—out west from Albury airport. I used to be an aerial mustering pilot, so I do not fly very high off the ground. I looked out and saw the magnificent patchwork of farmland, irrigated agriculture, rice paddocks, cereal and horticulture lining the Murray River on my left as I travelled further west. On the right, towards Hay and the Murrumbidgee and further towards the western division of New South Wales, which is also in my electorate, I saw country which can only be described as 12- to 13-inch rainfall scrub country. If it were not for irrigation, all of western New South Wales would look like that; it would not support the towns and the communities that it does and it would not have the vibrancy and the life-giving experiences that we participate in each and every day as members of that community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I came to this place 10 years ago very much arguing for the rights of the irrigator farmers in my electorate. I came to understand that it was about much more than agriculture, important though the contribution of that is to the nation's economy; it was about the communities and about life on our greatest river system. It was, we believed—and, some days, I still believe—a life very much threatened by what is in front of us with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a process which has exhausted and drained so many people that I represent—the irrigation corporations, the representatives from community groups, the people who try to help young people into jobs when jobs are scarce and the people who survived almost 10 years of drought, and what an awful experience that was. That has nothing to do with anything other than Australia's climate, but it highlights what life deals up for us in the bush and rural Australia. Here we are almost at the end of the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are difficult decisions to make when you belong to a party that represents all of Australia. I am a very proud member of the Liberal Party, and I know that, as Liberals, we represent very diverse constituencies and a lot of different points of view. That is one of the strengths that we as a party have and it is one of the things that has always attracted me to the party. The challenge in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan process is to bring these different interests together. Sometimes I vigorously disagree with my colleagues. Sometimes they drive me crazy. When the subject is water and the colleagues are in South Australia they often drive me crazy—and I am sure I do them as well, because each of us comes to this place with the interests of our constituents at heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For us to walk away at the last hurdle, at the eleventh hour, I do not believe is an option. Today I spoke to many of the people who have been on this journey with me. I asked them, 'Would you like to see the plan chucked out or would you like to see it passed with minimum damage? What types of changes might we make on your behalf'—I was pretty sure I knew how they felt, but I wanted to ask them firsthand—' that could make this process easier for you?' I did not speak to everybody, but some in the Murray Group of Concerned Communities. I spoke to RAMROC, which is a group of mayors and councillors in rural New South Wales. I spoke to SunRice, representing rice growers in western New South Wales. I spoke to many other individuals whose opinions I respect, ranging from the catchment management authorities to individuals. Nobody said to me that they wanted us to walk away from this at the last hurdle. The response was that that would be almost too much to bear. I understand that. That is why I am still here and still fighting for the things that I believe we can achieve within this process with a government that I think in many respects has failed the constituents that I represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will never accept this plan's poor science and its poor modelling. We will continue to fight for the priority to be about people and infrastructure, and not the buyback of water. But this piece of legislation, which is a crazy—if I may say so—bolted-on addition to what had been quite an exhaustive Basin Plan process, makes no sense to the people of the New South Wales Murray and Darling. I want to highlight some of the reasons why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes no sense because it talks about relaxing constraints as if constraints can be just waved away. It allocates $200 million to remove constraints. It describes the flows in the Murray and Darling river system that would result if we removed constraints. If I could pick on the Darling, it talks about flows of 14,000 to 18,000 megs a day in the Lower Darling. To achieve those flows you would actually have to channelise the Darling. You could not have it looking like the river it is now. Maybe we could have—ridiculous though it sounds—concrete structures out there to build channels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many years ago we did a project on the Great Darling Anabranch which piped the Anabranch to the Darling and restored, I think, about 47 gigalitres to the environment and cost about $57 million. That project has been waved away in this process because the Anabranch can just be cut off and the water can continue down the Darling. That makes no sense to me and it certainly does not to the people who live there. The minister has talked about constraints, meaning perhaps lifting bridges. Sounds easy! I think, in the Wakool Shire in my electorate—and the minister has visited the Wakool Shire; I give him credit for the visits he has made to my electorate—there are about 43 bridges. Many of them were re-done; they were old timber bridges. Under the previous government, we allocated an awful lot of money to repairing those bridges so they were safe for cars and trucks. In terms of relaxing constraints, what this would actually mean is that every single one of those 40-odd bridges would be raised to cope with a higher flow. Can anyone in this parliament imagine how—in a fiscally constrained environment post the next election, no matter who is in government—we might refuse cancer drugs, hospital treatment, education, benefits to people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, but have infrastructure activity that was to raise 40 perfectly good bridges in order to increase the flow underneath them? It is patently crazy. There is no sense at all in talking about something that cannot possibly be achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to place on record now some remarks from southern Riverina irrigators in my electorate, and they would like me to say this. The government is acquiring water for the environment without ever having done an analysis on how proposed volumes could be safely delivered. The Basin Plan is based on a model that assumes man-made, or even natural, system constraints can be removed or overcome without any real understanding of what these constraints actually are. For example, the relationship of the Cadell Tilt Barmah choke on the Murray River flows in summer and during winter flow events—to work out a constraints management strategy over a future 12-month period after decisions are made on the Basin Plan is unacceptable. There are significant data gaps in social and economic studies that have accompanied development of the Basin Plan. In short, the full cost of the Basin Plan far exceeds the $10 billion to $12 billion that has so far been identified. There has been no evaluation of costs associated with reduced productivity in Australia's food bowl, nor with delivery of environmental flows. I just want to bring that sense of the craziness of relaxing constraints and allocating $200 million to do that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area between Lake Hume and Yarrawonga, efforts were made to negate the third-party impacts and increase the flow some years ago to 25,000 megalitres a day. Under this proposal, in this legislation, that flow would increase to 40,000 megalitres a day. That would flood homes. It would flood properties. It would change the character of the people who use the river for amenity—for camping, fishing, holidays. It would simply turn it into a fast-flowing channel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the minister is serious about this then he should direct his department to do some serious analysis on this and bring some confidence to our communities. That is why we have moved amendments to this bill that will reflect our grave concerns about there being no socioeconomic evaluation of what it means to relax constraints. We will move amendments that will legislate the commitments that have already been made by the government, because the minister has said many times that he does not intend to resort to a market buyback. If he considers our amendments, he should accept them, because they would actually legislate what he has pretty well stated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also move an amendment that says that expenditure on farm infrastructure works cannot be used for buybacks, and the total amount of buybacks will be capped at 1,500 gigalitres. That means that the gap that exists between the water that is being bought back now and 2,100 gigalitres, which is a baseline figure that people will, reluctantly, as a second-best solution, accept, is all that can be bought in a market buyback. We will cap the total amount of buybacks at 1,500 gigalitres and we will require that actions to remove constraints and those needed to achieve this potential 450 gigalitres recovered under this account must satisfy an improved or a neutral socioeconomic test—in other words, no socioeconomic disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are sensible amendments. So we really are putting it to this government and this minister to consider them. If the statements that he made at the Press Club in good faith to the constituents that I represent about their futures mean anything, then he will agree to our amendments. We accept that this plan is a flawed process. There will be more that I can say about the plan, perhaps, in a future debate. This is not the plan that the coalition would have ever brought to this parliament. There are enormous challenges, including the environmental watering plan, what happens in the relationship between the states and the federal government, where the fixed charges for water end up, who pays, what the cost will be, what the regulation impact statement will be and how to formalise the savings. There is a plethora of work that has simply not been done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has not filled any of us with confidence. We have been let down by the authority time and time again. It has never had a focus that has meant anything to farmers or agriculture. It has never done any socioeconomic studies, although it has ticked the various boxes to say that it has. It has failed the basic test of inspiring confidence in the communities that it has worked with, because it has not actually worked with the communities at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is bad. Our amendments need to stand to neutralise it—to make it bearable. I will hold this government to account for the things they do in relation to Basin Plan processes in my electorate for the foreseeable future. This is not something that is easy for any of us on this side of the House. These are difficult decisions but I do accept that to go back and start again is simply untenable. But I will be here at the table. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for New England is not here but visited large parts of my electorate—as did I and other members of this place—during an inquiry which actually made recommendations that were agreed to by all sides of the House. But the government has ignored many of those recommendations. I would like to hear the member for New England vote in favour of our amendments, because the member for New England understands this stuff very well, and people trusted him when he travelled through my area. They are very much looking to him now to make some statements about this legislation and this Basin Plan process that restores their faith in this parliament. </span>

                    <a href="00AMU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MIRABELLA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:57</span>):  We do live in interesting times! I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 because, in all likelihood, it will be the last opportunity for me to speak on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in this parliament. I would like to begin by commending my neighbour the member for Farrer, who has been engaged and exercised about this issue for as long as I have known her as a member in this House. She has, like so many others, been put in a position to make a very difficult decision. She has had to balance up both sides of the debate and the options available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we have had an in-depth analysis and discussion because we have members of parliament who have gained the trust of people in basin electorates. We represent basin electorates. It is an area of policy that is fraught with difficulty, as was related by previous speakers, particularly the member for Mayo, because we seek to find agreement between four states. Each of these states has competing interests and each is seeking the best possible outcome, naturally, for its own jurisdiction. On top of that, this issue requires us to find an appropriate balance between the impact on regional communities and the impact on the environment. Under those circumstances, it is no wonder that the debate has been raging for such a long time and that it is not an easy debate. This is not the end of the debate. This is a important part in the process, but there are many unanswered questions. It is often much harder to implement a policy successfully than to pass a bill in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By definition, it was always going to be a more difficult debate for this side of the House, the coalition. That is because we represent Australians across a diversity of electorates, whether they be in irrigation districts, including in the basin, or in inner city areas, particularly in Adelaide. We actually represent and care about those very diverse constituencies. While most of those on the other side have sat back and been, frankly, quite bored by the discussion on this very important issue, have shown little interest and have, at times, been quite silent, coalition members and senators, particularly from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, have engaged, many of us for a long time, in painstaking discussions and negotiations to reach the point that we find ourselves at today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know and appreciate that some members in this place, colleagues of mine, have been looking deep within themselves as they have considered their positions on the final plan. I know that it is not an easy decision that many of them have taken. I respect their decisions as private members. At the same time, I would also like them and others to consider the alternative. There is a political reality here. There is the reality that people want some progress. It is true that they do not have faith that this government can deliver the practical outcomes that are intended in the legislation. It is true that they have no faith that this government will find the money to be able to deliver what this legislation is intended to. But they do want to see some progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another problem. It is obvious that the Labor Party will pass this plan one way or another. Their intentions are quite clear. If they do not pass it with the support of the coalition, they will take what has been the usual course in this highly dysfunctional and irregular parliament and pass it with the support of those fringe-dwellers of the Australian political landscape, the Greens. Invariably that will mean bowing to their demands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not suggesting that this plan is perfect by any means. There are still many questions that are unanswered. But what I can say is that the plan that Minister Burke tabled on Monday is vastly better than the draft plan that was released in October 2010. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate every single community, those thousands of people across the basin, that stood up and had their voices heard and that were not going to accept an appalling draft that was deficient in its analysis and that took a broad-brush approach. It was an absolute disaster. But for those communities standing up and scaring the bejesus out of this government we would not have had many of the changes along the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make this point very clear to my constituents in north-east Victoria, because there have been significant concessions made in my electorate in the north-east of Victoria of Indi. I want to take a few moments to outline some of these concessions. There are three main river systems in my electorate that are subject to the outcomes of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan: the Ovens River, which stretches from Mount Hotham to Bundalong through some of the richest agricultural land in the country; the Kiewa River, which runs from Mount Bogong in the high country through Dederang and Tangambalanga until it reaches the Murray just east of Albury; and the Broken River, which runs from Mansfield through Benalla and joins the Murray at Shepparton. These river systems support a significant agricultural industry in my electorate and are obviously vital for the ongoing viability of the many small rural communities that are scattered throughout the north-east. The original guide to the draft Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which was released in October 2010, proposed extraordinarily savage cuts to irrigation entitlements in each of these three river systems. All three rivers were targeted at the extreme upper range of SDL reductions. Forty-five per cent cuts were proposed in the Ovens River, the Kiewa River and the Broken River but the practical implication for irrigation was much worse than that. The government's first draft was incredibly sloppy in many respects, but in this case they had actually applied the reduction targets to the overall interceptions in each river system. Town water supply takes up a significant proportion of the overall diversions in the Ovens and Kiewa. So when you actually apply a reduction target to the overall diversions you have to either limit town supply or make a dramatic raid on irrigation entitlements. So the Ovens and Kiewa both faced cuts to irrigation entitlements in excess of 70 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put questions to the MDBA following the release of the first guide and even they admitted that the proposals would result in 'perverse outcomes' and even flagged the possibility of limiting town water supply. It was another mess. In those first six months following the release of the guide, I worked very hard in my endeavours to right these perverse outcomes and to get the government to listen to the case of north-east Victoria. I attended public consultation meetings that were chaired by the MDBA and I invited the chair of the authority at the time, Mike Taylor—a very good man, I might add—to meet with farmers and business people in my electorate office. I took a delegation of farmers and local government representations to meet with Minister Burke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I made submissions to both parliamentary inquiries and to the MDBA, and I gave evidence at a public hearing of one of those inquiries. I am pleased to say that those efforts were not wasted; they were not in vain. To the basin authority's credit, they listened to the case that we put and they made appropriate changes to the following draft. All subsequent plans have proposed zero cuts to watercourse diversions in each of the three river systems. Furthermore, no cuts have been flagged for a major underground water recess in the Wangaratta and alpine regions. This is important because, as I made clear in my submissions to those inquiries, the strength of the north-east is that water is used closest to its source. It is its point of differentiation with many other districts in the basin. We do have the distinction, I suppose, and the honour of providing about 40 per cent of the water that feeds into the system. As a consequence, farms in Indi are some of the most efficient users of water in the nation because they use water closest to the source. The usual loss of water in transportation is not the case in Indi but that relative efficient use of water is a debate for another day, which I am sure will be another long debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I am not suggesting by any means that this is a perfect plan. I mentioned before that I still have questions that have not been answered. I am particularly concerned about the potential ramifications of the recently announced relaxed constraints, which brings me to the core of the bill currently before the House. Where is the economic modelling to show the true cost of the impact of these relaxed constraints? It is not there. That is why I do not believe this government can actually deliver. This bill is intended to recover an additional 450 gigalitres through further investments in farm infrastructure and efficiency programs. But delivering this additional water would require the government to relax constraints. What this essentially means is that the water authority will be given the authority to manipulate major flood events along key sections of the Murray-Darling Basin instead of the minor flood events that it would previously have had the authority to give to do. To give you an example of this, the current maximum flow between the Hume Weir and the Yarrawonga Weir—water that passes right through my electorate—is 25,000 megalitres per day. Under the relaxed constraints scenario, this would increase to 40,000 megalitres. Similarly, the maximum flow down the Goulburn River in the southern part of my electorate would increase from 12,000 megalitres to 15,000 megalitres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are obvious concerns about this. The government has commissioned modelling on the environmental benefits of removing these constraints, but at no point has it examined the true cost of removing these constraints. I am talking about not just the financial cost but also the social implications. These increased flows could potentially flood private, freehold and agricultural land. Land along the Yea River downstream of Lake Eildon and the Goulburn River flats and the southern parts of my electorate would be at risk. Land between the Hume Weir and Yarrawonga Weir would face a similar threat. In the absence of proper modelling that considers the social and economic consequences of these relaxed constraints, it is very difficult to determine exactly what impact these changes would have on parts of my electorate and on other key parts of the basin. So it is absolutely essential that this modelling is done before these so-called restraints are relaxed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition amendment will require that water only be recovered in a way that does not cause economic or social detriment. It does this in three ways. It inserts objectives of the bill that neutral or beneficial socioeconomic outcomes must be achieved. It limits the amount of water that can be bought back to 15,000 gigalitres, consistent with the government's announced water recovery strategy. It requires the secretary of the department to report on how any water recovered achieves a neutral or beneficial socioeconomic outcome in the annual report required under this bill. This is a very important amendment. It also ensures that the additional 450 gigalitres cannot be sought through any buyback mechanism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister himself recently said, 'Now the extra 450 gigalitres is acquired through the sorts of on-farm infrastructure projects that we have run to date.' This amendment, in effect, gives weight to his words. So if the minister is fair dinkum he should not have any problem in supporting this particular amendment. It was the Howard government that started this plan, and it will only be an Abbott government that can manage the budget to fully implement this plan by 2019. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TRUSS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">23:12</span>):  The Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 establishes a special account to acquire additional environmental water for the Murray-Darling system, up to 450 gigalitres. There has been no science to support this extra 450 gigalitres. There does not seem to be any basic plan that has led to this figure having been chosen. It is simply, as everyone acknowledges, to appease the South Australian Labor government. But what people need to acknowledge and remember in South Australia is that this bill will also hurt the farmers of South Australia. They will also pay something of the price that will be inflicted upon the rural sector as a result of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's Murray-Darling plan has been welcomed by no-one but the minister and his own colleagues. The minister with his smiling face boasting about his great achievement, typical of Labor's overblown rhetoric, has not impressed too many people. His friends the Greens, with whom Labor are in a coalition government, are seeking to disallow the plan. The hardcore environmentalists, of course, do not want any human to live on the water of the basin, so they will never be satisfied. The states are opposed to it for different reasons. Irrigators, who have already given 3,000 to 4,000 gigalitres up for environmental flows over the years—much of it without any compensation—are unhappy. The communities are opposed. I attended some of the angry rallies that occurred during earlier iterations of this plan, and watched those reports being burnt. Those communities, whilst their anger has been a little more muted this time, are simply exhausted and are not really up to having more rallies. But they are still concerned about the impact of proposed water buybacks on the future economic viability of their communities. Already these communities have paid a high price. The whole basin has paid a price. There is shattered confidence, lost productivity and degraded towns. The result of all of this uncertainty, the result of Labor's continual whittling away of the water resources available to the communities, is a significant economic effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's commitment to recover this water in ways that do not weaken social and economic outcomes in the Murray-Darling is wishy-washy at best. The opposition is therefore proposing constructive amendments to clarify and bolster this commitment into something that the 2.1 million Australians who call the basin home can have some faith in. Despite the assurances by the government that there is nothing in this bill that requires the government to recover water with any deference to social or economic considerations at all, this government have form. They claim that there will be no regional impact on communities, but they have taken the lazy way of delivering water for the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin in the past, resorting always to buybacks. The potential to use engineering solutions is acknowledged, but very little has actually been done—they have taken the lazy way. There is a genuine concern in the community, because of the weakness of this legislation, that the government intend to take the lazy way yet again—simply resorting to buybacks. It is a great concern of basin communities. Earlier versions of the draft Basin Plan have tried to sell them up the river, and they can be forgiven for having a disturbing sense of deja vu.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once, previously, the minister told the parliament that there would be no more buybacks, but there was an advertisement in the newspaper two days later. The government gave lip service to the notion that water would only be recovered in an economically neutral way, via on-farm infrastructure projects. But those promises have been worthless in the past. And this legislation must not allow, by incompetence or malicious design, any wriggle room. If the government is fair dinkum about providing this extra 450 gigalitres without hurting communities, then let's make sure this bill makes that commitment crystal clear. No-one trusts the basin authority to manage the water wisely or sympathetically. The minister was once the agriculture minister, but many farmers and others feel that, since he has become the environment minister, he has forgotten his former constituency. The fishermen feel that they have been sold out. The foresters have been sold out. And now farmers and irrigators are concerned that, once again, they will be the losers as a result of this plan. In question time he boasts about the plan, and he boasts about water for the environment, but there has been nothing said about sympathy for the farmers who will have to pay this cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is important that the legislation is clear. The government have said that they do not propose to resort to buybacks, but they are not prepared to have that put in the legislation. Is it any wonder, therefore, that people are concerned? The coalition's amendment requiring that water only be recovered in a way that does not cause economic or social detriment is a fair and reasonable change that can give river communities the confidence they desperately need that they will not be railroaded down the track. Our measured amendment to this bill suggests that any reduction in the long-term average sustainable diversion limit for the water resources of a particular water resource plan area may only be achieved through the purchase of water access rights if the purchase of these rights will not cause apparent social or economic detriment to the district in the Murray-Darling Basin from which the water is retrieved. So we are not talking about a total ban; we just want to be sure that there will not be economic detriment to communities as a result of these purchases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill allows for the funds in the special account to be used to purchase water access rights. The fact that the government is not willing to accept our amendments demonstrates that they do intend to achieve the water they want in the traditional Labor lazy way—just through buybacks. More water buybacks are the last thing that irrigators in communities of the Murray-Darling Basin need. They have already poured significant waters into the river system over the years, much without compensation. Buybacks have left infrastructure stranded, they have increased distribution costs and they have seriously damaged many irrigation communities. Any further water savings must come from engineering and infrastructure works to deliver water to the river that does not come at the expense of farmers and their communities and that does not create social or economic detriment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Engineering and management solutions are able to deliver the water required for the environment. I was chairman of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council when the Living Murray Initiative was developed. That was a 500-gigalitre initiative to provide water for key environmental science. There were no buybacks for the Living Murray Initiative. The living Murray initiative proved that it was possible to make engineering savings that could deliver water for the environment. But in particular it also established that it was possible to manage relatively limited amounts of water to achieve substantial environmental benefits. You can manage environmental water, just as you can manage water for use in industry and in irrigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That, in my view, was the greatest achievement of the Living Murray Initiative. Yes, it was an extraordinary effort to get the states to agree with the Commonwealth to undertake a measure of that nature. I acknowledged at the time the cooperation I received from ministers of the opposite political persuasion to make that happen. But the real breakthrough was that there was an acceptance that we would manage the environmental water and that, indeed, it could be used to water more than one wetland in the same year. It could ensure that a breeding cycle of birds could be completed before the area dried up. If, in fact, it was completed, then you could move the water to water some red gums or whatever might be further downstream. You only really had to go back and do that same wetting of an area every five years or so to maintain and, indeed, increase the bird stocks. So it is possible to do this sort of thing. We can put in lined channels, pipelines and low-volume irrigators. There are all sorts of innovative projects that are being proposed. We simply have to get on with it and do it. Sadly, the disappointment of recent times has been that that has not happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Prime Minister made her promise in Adelaide on 26 October 2012 which led to this bill, she said that the government would recover an additional 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. The government gave a commitment that water would only be recovered in an economically neutral way via on-farm infrastructure projects. But, unfortunately, this bill walks away from that commitment. It does not entrench that principle in the legislation. Unfortunately the Prime Minister has broken promises in the past and, when the promise is not included in the legislation, suspicions are naturally raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have a proposal for an amendment that would change the bill from recovering up to 450 gigalitres to requiring 450 gigalitres to be recovered. This is typical of the Greens strategy of closing down whole industries by stealth. They are never satisfied. Once they have one piece, they want a bit more and then they keep on going. If you do not agree with me, ask me to repeat the story of the regional forest plans and the marine parks. Certainly the Murray-Darling water plan is not likely to be any different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Farmers' Federation and the New South Wales Irrigators' Council support amendments to this bill. They want to restrict the use of funds to water efficiency projects to require that the 2,750 gigalitres must be acquired before any new money is spent from this account. The future coalition government is determined to deliver genuine security to Murray-Darling Basin communities. The coalition, in government, will amend the water recovery strategy to cap buybacks at 1,500 gigalitres. Around 1,250 gigalitres has already been purchased, already way above what was originally proposed for buybacks. Our commitment in no way undermines our support for the requirement for the plan to deliver an additional 2,750 gigalitres of environmental flows. It is a guarantee that the coalition will work with the states to deliver on the infrastructure. Environmental works and measures targets have been set by the existing water recovery strategy to deliver the required water above 1,500 gigalitres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear: if our amendments moved today are unsuccessful, we commit to making them law as a priority should we win the next election. Our amendments deliver the government's stated intent for this legislation but without a new round of pain, hardship, tears and despair. These commitments include actions to remove constraints and those needed to achieve up to 450 gigalitres recovered under the special account to satisfy a neutral-or-better socioeconomic test. The bill seeks to put aside money to pay for additional water and works to allow the 2,750 gigalitres to increase to 3,200 gigalitres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Delivering more than 2,750 gigalitres of water back to the environment requires removing substantial physical constraints in the system and some of these constraints are natural—narrow channels et cetera. Nature cannot take the volume of water under this plan that is supposed to be pushed down the river, so it will be necessary to spend a lot of money. For example, flows between the Hume Dam and the Yarrawonga Weir are limited to a maximum of 25,000 megalitres a day. Lifting the water recovery target to 3,200 gigalitres would require flows of 40,000 megalitres per day in this area, and doing so would require the government to purchase easements over 10,000 hectares of land to be flooded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill appropriates $1.77 billion until 2024 towards the special account, yet only $55 million of this amount is included in the forward estimates. The coalition is trying to play a constructive role in getting the best possible plan for the basin communities. Our commitment to cap the buyback at 1,500 gigalitres will provide confidence for those who depend on the system and on its water resources. We will improve the Basin Plan. We support the basin communities. We support the basin's economy and we are determined to also protect the basin's environment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I would like to acknowledge the outstanding achievements of the Gold Coast Master Rowers at the recent Pan Pacific Masters Games rowing regatta that was held on 3 and 4 November on the Gold Coast. They achieved an outstanding result, leaving the event with 40 medals—which was more than any other club participating at the games. The club actually finished the regatta with a final medal tally of 14 gold, 15 silver and 11 bronze medals, and there was only one other team that managed to leave the regatta with more gold medals. It was a fantastic achievement and each of the rowers from the club who took part in that event should be proud of their results. I know that I certainly am proud on their behalf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Originally founded in 2004, the Gold Coast Master Rowers Club has been based at the Varsity Lakes Sports House for over three years and has more than 40 registered members from a variety of age groups, although many of the active rowers are over 40 years old. The club actively supports and promotes rowing as a sport and supports the rowing activities of students from nearby Varsity College as well as community members who want to keep fit and healthy or want to develop their rowing skills for competition. I was fortunate last year to have attended the opening of the club's new boatshed, and it is wonderful to see the club's members excelling in the face of fierce competition. The boatshed is actually located adjacent to the water, as you would imagine, behind the Varsity Lakes Sports House, which was recently established and is doing a great job fostering sports activities and developing those in the local area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dale Salmon, who is the sports and recreation coordinator of Varsity Lakes Community Ltd is actually part of the McPherson Local Sporting Champions Committee, along with Ron Workman OAM, the chairman of Currumbin RSL, Dr Danny O'Brien, from Gold Coast Surf City Inc., and Alf Duval, who is a former Olympic rower. We met recently to discuss nominations for scholarships and we decided that the most worthwhile recipients this time were Ellie Pobar for soccer; Jade Horcicka for soccer; Jack Hulyer for golf; Ellie Papalexiou for soccer; Rebecca Kay for golf; Alexander Crnokrak for tennis; Simioluwa Thomsen-Ajayi for track and field events; Cory Beaman for track and field; Dextar Muskens for surf riding; Krystle McKenzie for basketball; and Joanne Parker, representing the Gold Coast under 16 girls Waves basketball team. The under-16 girls Waves Gold Coast team won the team award for this most recent round of scholarships. I congratulate all the recipients.</span>

The purpose of the visit was to advance that agenda and the association that we have had with Italian infrastructure companies and also have meetings about the air services agreement between Australia and Italy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trip also involved a visit to the city of Giovinazzo. Giovinazzo is a port city on the Adriatic Coast in the region of Apulia. It has a population of some 20,000 and is a seaside destination for Italian tourists, with its own local fishing industry. In 1989 Leichhardt in my electorate of Grayndler formed a twin city relationship with Giovinazzo in recognition of the large number of migrants from the city and other parts of the region of Apulia who have settled in the Leichhardt area. I am also half Apulian and was very pleased to be able to represent my electorate in Giovinazzo. It was an extraordinary Italian welcome. The mayor and all of the council turned up, as well as what appeared at times to be most of the city of Giovinazzo, to show us around. Meetings were held at the town hall and at the local community centre where school children had three walls covered with their drawings showing their feelings about Australia. Kangaroos, koalas, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House featured prominently in those drawings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The local band played the Australian national anthem as well as the Italian national anthem at Piazza Leichhardt, which is a magnificent piazza in Giovinazzo. There were many people there, all of whom seemed to have a relative in or a connection to Australia. It was indeed a very proud moment. I note that Leichhardt has established the Giovinazzo Grove within Leichhardt Park that overlooks Iron Cove. It was a great moment and I thank the mayor, Tommaso Depalma, and other dignitaries including the carabinieri commander, municipal police commander and others who participated, including the Giovinazzo Municipal Orchestral Band, for the fine welcome. Our muliculturalism was celebrated with this event and it was indeed a proud moment and a celebration of the connection between Australia and Italy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I rise to highlight my ongoing concerns at the lack of funding to support a much-needed redevelopment of facilities at the Latrobe Regional Hospital in my electorate. By way of background, the LRH board applied to the Commonwealth for $65 million under the Health and Hospitals Fund Regional Priority Round. I acknowledge the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and I appreciate her correspondence earlier this year when she advised me that applications totalling more than $3.4 billion were received for the programs, obviously exceeding the $475 million that was available at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also been advised by correspondence from the department that LRH was eligible but, due to the strong demand in this round of funding, not all projects would proceed. Unfortunately, that leaves the Latrobe Regional Hospital in a difficult situation in that I have heard that the state and federal governments have both recognised that the need is there and the project is regarded as essential for the community but there is not a readily available source of funding or future rounds at this stage. I do recognise the difficulties the government is facing. I also recognise the difficulties the coalition is facing in this regard because of difficult budget conditions. Both sides of the House will face challenges in developing their future policies for regional hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, I encourage both sides to recognise that, while the closure of this particular program was expected, there are a number of hospitals located throughout regional Australia that are now searching for avenues of funding to support such critical developments and associated capital works. Naturally, I am very keen to see the Latrobe Regional Hospital project proceed in the future because I believe it will provide improved care for residents in Latrobe Valley and the broader Gippsland region. It is a critical project for the future of my region, with far-reaching health, social and economic benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, we will need a future round to allow regional hospitals to undertake much-needed upgrades in partnership with state governments. The LRH staff and board do a tremendous job in quite difficult circumstances at the moment. The board chair, Kellie O'Callaghan and her team, both the paid staff and the volunteers, are working hard to meet the region's future health needs. They have been very diligent in their efforts to raise funds. The auxiliary's work is quite extraordinary, with a fundraising ball each year which raises tens of thousands of dollars, a fun run and a lot of other activities in which the community can demonstrate its support for Latrobe Regional Hospital. But the scale of the funding we are talking about is beyond the capacity of a community in terms of its own fundraising activities. Unfortunately, we have the situation with LRH where the growth in demand has outpaced the existing facilities, and a major upgrade is required to meet both the current demand and the future needs of the Latrobe Valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be fair to the government, this is not intended as an attack on it, because my region has benefited from more than $20 million to the Gippsland Cancer Care Centre, and work is about to start on that project. On Friday I attended the official opening of the Gippsland Rotary Centenary House, which benefited from $1.5 million from the government. At that ceremony I paid credit to the government and to the minister in her absence for the bipartisan support that this project has received. Unfortunately, more needs to be done, and I encourage the government to work in partnership with state governments and the coalition in securing funding for future upgrades of regional hospitals, both in Gippsland and throughout Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Australia has always been characterised as having a vibrant multicultural people from all parts of the world. From time to time they have come here in different ways. In particular, there is one group in my electorate which I consider of great importance; the Vietnamese people, who have enriched Australia after a very difficult war in their own country and who have risked their lives fleeing repression from the Vietnamese government after that war ended. We know that Australia was very generous and accepted many thousands of Vietnamese people. They have made an enormous contribution to Australia and to Australia's way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as then, when Australia took a stand on human rights and on supporting the people of Vietnam, Australia today maintains that support. We do it through a range of mechanisms here in Australia for Vietnamese Australians and also back in Vietnam when issues of human rights are raised. I inform the House and people from all over the world that, unfortunately, it still is a concern that there are many human rights breaches in Vietnam. That is sad. It is sad for what, potentially, is a great country with great people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My local Vietnamese community and Vietnamese people right across Australia have not forgotten their homeland and continue to work to help free their family members, their friends and fellow Vietnamese people. Last Saturday I had the privilege of joining with my Vietnamese friends to sign the Million Hearts, One Voice Campaign petition where the aim is to gather 100,000 signatures to highlight the issues and problems that are happening in Vietnam, particularly with the arrest of dissidents for such crimes as writing songs, having an opinion or a view, belonging to a particular religion, having faith, wanting to have freedom of media, wanting to have expression of religion and other things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, in relation to matters of human rights we ought always to speak up for and on behalf of those who do not have a voice. That is what this Million Hearts, One Voice petition is about. The petition is addressed to the head of the United Nations Human Rights Council as well as to the human rights spokesperson and foreign affairs ministers of the EU, the European parliament, and a number of nations including Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. It is important that there will always be people in Australia and in those countries that I have mentioned which are prepared to stand up and speak for those without a voice. This is a global petition. It is 100,000 signatures. In fact there are many more than 100,000 signatures from Australia. To focus this issue on 10 December, which is international Human Rights Day, I encourage all Australians to continue to support our great community, the Vietnamese people and the new Vietnamese Australians.</span>

But to buy this house I had to tighten our belt and be careful with every cent I earn and then we just scrap in and get by each week. Every bit of my income has been calculated in to the purchase of the house, food and our basic needs. We don't have a flat screen TV or a new car or new trendy clothes. In the near future I may even have to ask for help from Community Services this to me is something I wished I would never have to do. Have you ever had to ask for help from the Salvation Army? Do you know what it's like? So when I received a call from Centrelink telling me about the changes and that I will lose $85:00 per week from my payment I cried.... I cried over the phone to the Centrelink lady, $85:00 is a lot to lose it was a shock and has caused me great stress since... I will now be forced to work another day and force my children to return home another afternoon after school alone...if I cannot get extra work it will be the kids that suffer in more ways that I can list here today.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  A few weeks ago I met with a passionate young man from my electorate, Will Bennett. Will, along with 80 other young Australians, travelled to South Australia in September for the Repower Port Augusta campaign. The group walked over 300 kilometres from Port Augusta to Adelaide. This two-week journey highlighted the campaign's proposal to develop six solar thermal plants and 95 wind turbines. Throughout the walk, the 80 Australians stopped through small towns and spoke with local farmers, business owners and many families about their views on the future of power supply for Port Augusta.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pleasing to see young local people across my electorate engage in such activities, and I hope that many others will follow Will's lead and speak up on issues that are important to them. Will said the walk was an amazing experience. He has been involved in a variety of campaigns over recent years highlighting the importance of environmental policies. Will said that this was the first time he felt that the outcome could directly impact on climate change. He went on to say that although the walk was physically challenging, 'It was the people we were walking with and the locals we met on the way that made that worth while.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is something that has been at the forefront of the government's agenda. Only last week I visited a Ballarat based business, Ceramet, who received funding through the Automotive New Markets Program. That funding is enabling this automotive component manufacturer, which is increasing its employment, to diversify its developing to build a product to work with large-scale solar farms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last weekend we saw the announcement by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation board of their new chief executive, Oliver Yates. The CEFC, along with the carbon price, the renewable energy target and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, will see approximately $100 billion in investment in the renewables sector over the next 40 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we also saw the release of the International Energy Agency's in-depth review, which commended Australia for its commitment to the development of carbon capture and storage, the level of transparency in the carbon pricing mechanism, and the commitment to releasing an energy white paper every four years. Also released recently was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Major electricity generation projects</span> November 2012 report by the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics, which showed that more than two-thirds of major electricity projects in advanced development are renewable-energy based.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put on the record my strong support for the renewable energy target, 20 per cent of electricity supply coming from renewable energy by 2020. I know that the final report of the review is due with the government by the end of the year, and there was significant interest and contribution when the initial discussion paper was released back in October. I reiterate my support for it. I think the renewable energy target alongside the carbon price, the work of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency are all needed together to tackle the issue of climate change.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MATHESON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  Today marks four weeks until Christmas Day, so I take this opportunity to mention some of the fantastic things happening in Macarthur to celebrate Christmas and support others this holiday season. I have had a fantastic response for this year's Christmas for the Troops campaign. Locals have dropped boxes of items into my office to send to Australian troops serving overseas. Students from St Thomas More Catholic Parish Primary School in Ruse have particularly been generous, sending more than 60 packages to our servicemen and women. Christmas can be a very sad time for those spending it away from loved ones, so it is great to see so many people supporting this cause. Our local media has done a fantastic job promoting that program. They even collected items themselves to send overseas. I thank them all for their coverage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to home, those doing it tough this Christmas will benefit from programs run by Lifeline Macarthur. The charity is raising money to fund these programs by giftwrapping in the centres across my electorate for two weeks leading up to Christmas. I hope locals doing their shopping will stop by to have their presents wrapped by the lovely Lifeline volunteers. All the money raised will help the charity support those less fortunate in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Christmas is always an exciting time of the year in Macarthur with many events for local families to attend. These events are organised by volunteers from the business community, chambers of commerce, local councils, churches and schools to bring people from all over Macarthur together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Narellan Chamber of Commerce, Narellan Town Centre, Lifehouse Church Camden and the Rotary club of Narellan put together a committee to kick off the celebrations on 3 November for the Christmas in Narellan festival. Hundreds of locals attended the carols, the entertainment and the lighting of the Christmas tree at Narellan Town Centre. The Camden Chamber of Commerce hosted Light Up Camden on 17 November, which was also a big hit, with thousands flocking to the town for rides, stalls, fireworks and entertainment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents will come together for the Campbelltown City Christmas Carols this Saturday at the Campbelltown Arts Centre, and The Oaks has its Christmas night set for next Friday. On 8 December Warragamba will host its carols in the park with a concert band, puppet show, performances by local schools and a barbecue provided by the Rural Fire Service. On 16 December a finalist from the Channel 9 hit TV series <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voice</span>, Emma Birdsall, will perform at Lifehouse Church Camden's Christmas celebration. Former Cronulla football star Jason Stevens and his wife, Bec, will also be there to celebrate the true meaning of Christmas with local families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In total, there will be more than 25 events across Macarthur between now and 25 December for local families to enjoy. Today I would like to thank all of the local committees, churches, schools, chambers and councils that have organised all of these fantastic events in Macarthur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These volunteers have worked so hard to make it possible for my community to come together at Christmas time and that is a wonderful thing to see. We are very lucky to have such wonderful volunteers, a supportive business community and dedicated churches in Macarthur to organise these events so that people of all ages, cultures and backgrounds can come together to celebrate the true meaning of Christmas—the birth of Jesus. I hope that these celebrations continue for many years to come and I wish everyone in my community a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to wish all my parliamentary colleagues a very happy Christmas and a safe new year with their family and friends.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  On 16 October this year I held a breakfast meeting with a small but passionate group of local social entrepreneurs: Bradley Carron-Arthur, Courtney Slone, Katrina Marson, Melanie Poole, Tony Shields and Ben Moody. The aim of the breakfast was to bring together these social entrepreneurs to share their stories, experiences and their ideas for solving some of the challenges they face. I hope in the future they can act as a brains trust for one another and for other budding social entrepreneurs. Their projects range from coordinating volunteers and boosting mental health awareness to improving Australia's international development efforts. I would like to thank them for their ideas and their efforts to assist those in need and for helping to build social capital. Social entrepreneurs are people who take an idea and with passion and persistence bring to fruition enterprises that assist those in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbes</span> magazine celebrated the work of social entrepreneurs by having the first top 30 social entrepreneurs list. Helen Coster of <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbes</span> magazine wrote that social entrepreneurs 'unlike millions of us who recognise some kind of a problem, feel a pang of hopelessness and move on' set about fixing the problems they see in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One great example of social entrepreneurship in my electorate is the Ben Donohue Run and Walk for Fun. Now in its eighth year, the Ben Donohue Run and Walk for Fun is one of the largest fun runs in the region. On 4 November 'team Leigh' joined a record 2,400 people for the six-kilometre circuit around Lake Ginninderra. This year we were pleased to help the run and walk raise over $55,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its inception, the Ben Donohue Run and Walk for Fun has donated over $350,000 to its nominated charities: the Council Support Council, Ronald McDonald House Canberra and Make a Wish Australia. It has greatly helped families affected by cancer through the most difficult time and brought hope and joy to the lives of seriously ill children. I pay tribute to Ben's extraordinary parents Peter and Robin Donohue, who organised the first event just months after Ben's passing. They really are social entrepreneurs who exemplify what can be achieved by those who set about fixing the problems they see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I recognise the members of team Leigh who joined me on the Ben Donohue fun run: Kate Reid, Liesel Hickman, Shane Drumgold, Nathan Lambert, Gus Little, Emily Murray, Michael and Paul Hiscox, Alice Wade, Michael Petterson, Kurt Steel, Alice Crawford, Ethan Moody, Shobaz Kandola, David Mathews, Victor Violante, Megan Ponder, Brenton Sloane and the indefatigable Claire Daly from my office, who recruited and organised this year's splendid team.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  Numerous members of this House have risen in support of the proposed National Disability Insurance Scheme and I would like to recommit, as I have to Ryan residents, to its implementation. I recently attended two DisabiliTEAs in October, in Chapel Hill and Mitchelton, where constituents reaffirmed their support for the NDIS and more importantly wanted to ensure that the scheme is not taken off the national agenda. I particularly want to thank Linda Cartmill and Help Enterprises hospitality training centre respectively for arranging these events and for their dedication to the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many members in recent weeks have been receiving correspondence from constituents sharing their stories about either themselves or family members living with a disability. I have received emails about how tough it is to have a wife with polio or a child with cerebral palsy, autism or speech-language impairment to name just some examples. One of these families is Karyn and Gerard Reardon of Toowong in my electorate. Their son Flyn has a rare chromosome mutation disorder with symptomatic effects similar to trisomy-21 or Turner's syndrome. Flyn has only been able to see the variety of specialists required since birth—paediatric physiotherapists, speech pathologists and occupational therapists—because his parents are fortunate enough to earn incomes adequate to provide for their child. The only other person in the world with a similar chromosomal mutation lives in Norway. Karyn tells me that they are supported extremely well by the Norwegian government. The services they can access are scattered across federal and state programs or through state education. This creates confusion for Karyn and Gerard, and means that Australians children with disabilities do not receive the support they deserve. Similarly, parents at the Glenleighden School, which caters for children with primary language disorder, are constantly asking for support from the federal government and being rejected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At present Australians with disabilities face a very frightening situation that, when they turn 65, the access they have to appropriate support through a home and community care package will be reduced. This is because funding and management of the HACC package changes from their state government to the federal Department of Health and Ageing and there is not necessarily consistency between the two. This problem further illustrates that no two states provide the same services if you have a disability. If you cross a state border there is no certainty about whether you will be better or worse off. This highlights the crucial importance of the NDIS being a national program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has maintained its support for the NDIS and it is important that we all work together to get this right. The coalition has proposed the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee chaired by both sides of politics to oversee its implementation. This would not only provide a mechanism for bipartisanship but also serve as a forum where questions of design, implementation, timetable, eligibility and a funding model could be raised and worked through. To date the Prime Minister has rejected our proposal and, disappointingly, in the Senate in June the government and the Greens voted against the establishment of the committee. Unfortunately to date there has been little detail provided by the government as to how individuals will be assessed, who will be eligible and what support services will be provided. We have talked the talk for long enough and now is the time for some real action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Last Thursday, 22 November, I had the pleasure of hosting a local school principals forum on Labor's national plan for school improvement with the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the Hon. Peter Garrett. The forum was held at Ringwood Secondary College, a highly regarded school in the local area that has a great name not only in the local community but in many suburbs surrounding the area. In particular the forum discussed the need for increases in recurrent funding for schools and the issues that principals have with the current funding system. Importantly, principals from all school sectors attended not only to listen to the minister but to ask questions and put forward their points of view. We also had six middle-school students from Ringwood secondary who were invited to sit in on the forum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, on 24 May, I was visited here in Canberra by a delegation of concerned teachers and parents from my electorate who wanted to talk about recurrent funding and the opportunities that arose from the recommendations of the Gonski report, which was handed down earlier this year. At that meeting, I met with the delegation which consisted of the principal of Ringwood Secondary College, Michael Phillips, a teacher from Rangeview Primary School Faye Natoli and others to hear directly about the problems our local schools have with recurrent funding systems. From the primary teachers I heard about art and PE budgets that are so small that they run out almost as soon as the year has started and about a severe limitation on funding for programs such as literacy recovery. From the parents I heard about the lack of funding for maintenance and for school programs. In many ways they were on the same page as the teachers. From Michael Phillips, the secondary principal, I heard that there was not enough funding for learning support programs and that English-as-a-second-language programs for refugee students did not have enough funding to deliver the results that were really needed. Of course, schools always make do with less, but that does not mean that the best is always done with less. Last week's Ringwood forum discussed needs based funding—topics such as loadings for Indigeneity, disability and students with low SES levels and support for students with English as a second language, amongst many other subjects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal Labor government has invested over $16 billion in building new school buildings to make our schools better places to learn through the Building the Education Revolution program. But it is now time to change how the federal government funds schools, and I eagerly await the introduction later this week of the legislation that will achieve this change inside our schools, because I think what has been done in the last few years for the outside of so many schools is a great thing. Time and again, throughout my electorate of Deakin, schools are wonderfully impressed with what has been done with the BER money. But, as they quite rightly say, 'We've now got a great building and we want to be able to achieve inside what has been achieved outside.' I certainly support them in that and I know so many people in the community do. It is a great change. It will be tough dealing with the states, but I am sure we will get there and it will be a great effort for everyone involved. Our kids will be better off for many years to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration and Citizenship</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  It is my pleasure to sum up this debate and to thank all honourable members for their contribution. However, I do have to correct a number of falsehoods and fallacies peddled by the honourable members who spoke opposite. Despite the contribution of several of their speakers, this bill does not, as those opposite would have you believe, create a new requirement on business, create any further obligations on business or create any red tape for business that does not currently already exist. What this bill does do is amend the Migration Act to create a graduated series of tiers for infringement notices, non-fault civil penalty provisions and non-aggravated and aggravated criminal offences—the employer sanctions provisions. This is all about providing the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with the necessary tools to make sure that people who are working illegally and employers who are hiring illegally can be dealt with under the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This set of measures was recommended to the Howard government many years ago, and it was rejected by the Howard government. This government commissioned Mr Stephen Howells to review the act, and he made a series of recommendations which this bill reflects. The Howells review is a very good one, and although the bill is about to pass I would nevertheless recommend it to those honourable members who have not read it—which I suspect is most honourable members opposite, because if they had read it then they would not have made the silly contributions that they made in this debate. The Howells review goes through the very serious issues of illegal work in Australia. It goes through some of the links to organised crime. It goes through some of the exploitation and underpayment of workers that occurs. Illegal work in Australia is a serious issue. It is very true that it is a very small minority of employees and employers who engage in this, but nevertheless it is serious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opposition which talks tough when it comes to so-called illegal immigration and which goes out there and beats its chest when it suits it about certain forms of migration, but where you have frankly much larger numbers of employees working illegally, whether they be visa overstayers or people working in breach of visa conditions, the opposition is struck dumb. More than being struck dumb, it wilfully opposes this legislation, trying to stop the government and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship having the ability to successfully prosecute employers who wilfully ignore their responsibilities. Checking to see if somebody is a legal worker in Australia is not an onerous responsibility. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship has the VEVO system, which works well and enables employers to check quite easily whether somebody is entitled to work in this country. Yet this opposition stands to oppose a bill which makes hiring illegal workers and exploiting illegal workers more difficult for employers by making it easier to prosecute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stress: there is not one extra requirement on employers, not one piece of red tape, not one process that employers have to go through. 'Just follow the law and don't hire people illegally.' That is what the law currently says. That is what the law said yesterday. It is what the law will say tomorrow. It is what the law will say after this bill passes the Senate. Yet, we see this opposition opposing this legislation which is hypocrisy at its worst. They are happy to issue press releases on a daily basis about illegal migration to Australia, but when it actually comes to an opportunity to do something about people working illegally in Australia—illegal migrants who are working in breach of their visa conditions or after their visa has expired—they choose to do nothing. And they choose to do worse than nothing: they choose to oppose the government's bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first announced this, the shadow immigration minister said, 'The government will have no problems with us on this bill.' Something changed on the way to Parliament House. I am not sure what changed, but what I am sure of is their position is illogical and hypocritical, and it underlines their cheap and opportunistic approach to all these matters and their complete refusal to engage in matters of substance.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  It is my pleasure to rise to talk on the Customs Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2012. I want to note at the outset that I am a very strong supporter of free trade. I think that whenever we have the chance to conclude an agreement with one of our friends or neighbours it is cause for this parliament to celebrate and endorse, because it provides not only plenty of opportunities both for our businesses and our services but also reciprocity for the services and businesses of the country with which we are pursuing the agreement. My enthusiasm for free trade is shared by all of my coalition colleagues. We are pleased about the more liberal access to each other's goods that the Australia free trade agreement will facilitate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of two-way goods and services, Malaysia is Australia's third largest trading partner in ASEAN and our 10th largest trading partner overall. The Australia-Malaysia economic relationship is a very significant one both for us and for the Malaysians as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in 2010-12 total merchandise trade between Australia and Malaysian was worth $14.2 billion, with Australian exports of $5 billion and imports of $9.1 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement comes at a time when total two-way services trade in 2011-12 was $3 billion, with Australian exports of $1.6 billion and imports of $1.3 billion. The agreement builds on the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement and allows for significant gains for services and investment through access to increased foreign ownership in key service sectors where Australia has proven capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's relationship with Malaysia has been long and productive. Initially, it dates back to the 19th century, when Malays participated in the pearling industry in Australia's northern waters. Australians fought alongside Malays in the 1941-42 Malayan campaign in World War II and assisted the newly independent Malaysia in the 1960s during the period of confrontation with Indonesia. Australia was also involved during the time of Malayan independence from Great Britain in 1957. Former Governor-General of Australia Sir William McKell helped draft the Malaysian constitution, and subsequently Australia also proudly sponsored Malaysia to join the United Nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Malaysian troops in more modern times have served alongside Australian Defence Force personnel in East Timor. Since that time, Australia and Malaysia have enjoyed an enduring and developing trading relationship, which I will speak about in some detail later on. Consultations regarding the free trade agreement with Malaysia have been underway since May 2005, when former Howard government trade minister Mark Vaile commenced negotiations with our Malaysian counterparts.</span>

                    </a>  In future, I should probably note where I am up to when we are interrupted by a division! So if I am repeating myself, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, please feel free to intervene.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I was just saying that as a coalition we are proud of the conclusion of this agreement with Malaysia because the negotiations for it were started under the previous, Howard government. Indeed, it was the then Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, who commenced these negotiations, in May 2005. The agreement was concluded by this government on 22 May, when it was signed in Kuala Lumpur, with the aim that the agreement would enter into force on 1 January next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's major merchandise exports to Malaysia include crude petroleum, copper, coal and aluminium. Australia is also one of the major providers of educational services to Malaysia. Malaysia is a major exporter of crude petroleum to Australia, as well as monitors, projectors, televisions, computers and telecommunications equipment and parts. Under this agreement, both countries will cut tariffs on a wide range of goods as well as make administration for trade simpler by addressing other barriers to trade. Australia will eliminate all tariffs on goods from Malaysia from day one. Malaysia will not go quite as far—they will eliminate tariffs on 97.6 per cent of goods imported from Australia from day one and that will rise to 99 per cent of goods imported from Australia from 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many prominent Australian industries are set to benefit from this new trade arrangement with Malaysia, including the Australian dairy industry. I know this will interest the member for Forrest. The Australian dairy industry's current exports to Malaysia are valued at $260 million per year. A liberalised licensing arrangement will allow larger volumes of milk to be exported and, for the first time, the opportunity to export high-value drinking milk in retail packs. As I said, I know the member for Forrest, with Western Australia's close proximity to Malaysia, will be interested in exploring the opportunities that are available to her constituents from this free trade agreement. In Dairy Australia's annual report for 2011-12 it was stated that as dairy products increasingly become part of the consumer's diet in Malaysia demand will only grow stronger, and Australia is well placed to meet this growing need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian automotive industry will also see an elimination of all tariffs from large cars and nearly all tariffs on automotive parts imported from Malaysia, with the elimination of all tariffs on small cars from 2016. Malaysia will immediately exempt Australian cars from its global limit on imports. The Australian wine industry will receive a guarantee of the best tariff treatment from Malaysia under the new agreement. Mr Steve Guy from Wine Australia said there were 136 individual Australian wine exporters to that market last year, which sends the message that maybe the small wine producers in Australia can find a niche in Malaysia. Given the proximity of Malaysia to Australia, and the overall preference for more expensive red wines, it makes it an attractive market for smaller producers strengthened further by this agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agricultural industry believes this agreement is a step in the right direction. Currently, Malaysia is Australia's fourth-largest sugar market and fifth-largest wheat export market. National Farmers Federation Vice President Duncan Fraser said the Malaysian market is worth about $1 billion in Australian agricultural exports and that these commodities can be boosted through the free trade agreement. Notably, there will be open access arrangements from 2023 for the rice industry, with all tariffs to be eliminated by 2026. This is a significant development for the Australian rice industry, which has traditionally struggled to get a foothold in Asian markets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other industries that stand to benefit include plastics, processed foods, chemicals and a wide range of manufactured products where all tariffs will be eliminated immediately. Also, tariffs on 96.4 per cent of steel and iron exports to Malaysia will be eliminated by 2016, then 99 per cent by 2017 and 100 per cent by 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To complete the domestic implementation of the agreement in Australia, it requires the amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the Customs Regulation Act 1926 and the enactment of a new customs regulation for the product-specific rules that are annex 2 of the agreement. On that note I now turn to the content of the two bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Customs Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2012 amends the Customs Act 1901 to outline the rules contained in the Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement. These rules are essential for determining whether imported goods from Malaysia are eligible for preferential rates of customs duty in accordance with the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These new rules are similar to other FTA arrangements and include definitions about when goods can be considered wholly obtained or produced, when goods are produced entirely from originating materials, and when goods are produced from non-originating materials only or from non-originating materials and originating materials. It includes a definition about what counts as a consignment and when goods are either accessories, spare parts, tools, or instructional or other informational materials imported with goods.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Customs Tariff Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2012 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 by providing free rates of customs duty for goods that are Malaysian originating goods in accordance with the new division 1H of part VIII of the Customs Act, by amending schedule 4 of the Customs Act to maintain customs duty rates for certain Malaysian originating goods in accordance with the applicable concessional item, and by inserting a new schedule 9 in the Customs Tariff Act to maintain excise equivalent rates of duty on certain alcohol, tobacco and petroleum products. These rates are equivalent to the rates of excise duty payable on the aforementioned goods when locally manufactured.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bilateral trade relationship between Australia and Malaysia has reached a significant cornerstone with the signing of this FTA. The agreement will help to diversify the trading relationship by opening up access to markets on both sides. This agreement will strengthen economic links between our two countries, and consumers in both countries will reap the benefits of liberalisation as prices go up and choices go up. The coalition welcomes the opportunity to renew our bilateral relationship with Malaysia. We therefore support the passage of these bills, and we look forward to them enhancing what is an already very strong economic relationship. We are pleased to see it come to fruition in the implementation of these bills, which will see the FTA implemented from 1 January next year.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Trade</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to be speaking in support of the Customs Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and the cognate bill. MAFTA is a very high-quality free trade agreement. It reflects the deep commitment of both Australia and Malaysia to trade liberalisation. It adds a new dimension to our bilateral relationship, and it is a tangible recognition of the strength of our existing trading relationship. It also builds on the agreement we already have with Malaysia through our FTA with the ASEAN countries and New Zealand. In the broader sense, it contributes to the future we share in our dynamic region in the Asian century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement is an early demonstration of Australia's commitment to the Asian century as we enter a new phase of deeper and broader engagement. The Minister for Trade and Competitiveness signed MAFTA on behalf of the Australian government on 22 May 2012 in Kuala Lumpur, along with his Malaysian counterpart, Mustapa Mohamed, Minister of International Trade and Industry. Negotiations started in May 2005 but were put on hold at the end of 2006 to allow both sides to focus on concluding the agreement establishing the ASEAN Australia-New Zealand free trade area. After the signing of the AANZFTA, our bilateral negotiations recommenced in 2009 and concluded in March 2012. This was following the instruction of Prime Minister Gillard and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib to work to conclude MAFTA negotiations within a year in March 2011. On entry into force, MAFTA would open new avenues for Australian goods and service exports. Like all of Australia's high-quality FTAs, MAFTA would open new opportunities for business, trade, job creation and economic ties between our countries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Malaysia is one of Australia's most important economic partners and regional neighbours. It is Australia's third largest trading partner in ASEAN and 10th largest trading partner overall, with bilateral trade worth $16 billion in 2011. And Australia has a diverse range of trade and investment interests in Malaysia, including in agriculture, manufacturing, resources, education, telecommunications and financial services. Around 3,500 Australian companies export to Malaysia each year, and Austrade estimates there are around 250 Australian companies represented in Malaysia. Indeed, Malaysia is an export orientated economy, with a plan to achieve developed economy status by 2020. Malaysia's trade with Australia has almost doubled in the past decade, growing at an average rate of 8.2 per cent year on year, and Malaysia is one of the region's most dynamic economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The entry into force of the AANZFTA in 2010 was a boost to our already close bilateral trade relationship. MAFTA would strengthen further our relationship and would be an asset to both our countries as we continue to negotiate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Australian and Malaysian business is well placed to benefit from the vigorous economic growth in both countries. Of course, MAFTA would provide for commercially meaningful improvements to Australia's market access to Malaysia and new trade disciplines that build on Malaysia's commitments under the AANZFTA. From MAFTA's entry into force, tariff-free access would apply to 97.6 per cent of 2009 to 2011 average imports into Malaysia from Australia, increasing to 98.9 per cent in 2016 and 99 per cent in 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Important outcomes for the automotive industry include the elimination of all tariffs on large cars and virtually all tariffs on auto parts on entry into force of the agreement, with tariffs on smaller cars eliminated by 2016 and removal of quantitive restrictions on motor vehicle imports from Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be tariff-free treatment for 94.6 per cent of recent iron and steel imports into Malaysia from Australia by 2016 rising to 99.9 per cent by 2017 and 100 per cent by 2020. There will be elimination of virtually all tariffs from entry into force on plastics, chemicals, a range of processed foods and manufactured products. Australian milk exporters will have access to additional quota and access for higher-value retail products. Australian rice exporters will have open access from 2023 and complete elimination of all tariffs by 2026.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">MAFTA has business-friendly rules of origin positions including a mechanism to allow goods exported from Australia to claim MAFTA tariff treatment solely on the basis of a declaration of origin by the exporter. For a wide range of service sectors, Australian entities will be able to acquire majority ownership in companies supplying services in Malaysia. This would include 70 per cent ownership in higher education services provided by privately funded institutions increasing to 100 per cent by 2015, and 70 per cent ownership in a range of other very important education services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment banking, telecommunications and direct insurance providers will be able to hold 70 per cent ownership. In addition accounting, auditing, book keeping services and management consulting service providers will be allowed to have 100 per cent ownership in Malaysia. MAFTA also provides the right to majority ownership for mining related services, taxation services, tourism and travel related services, and research and development services as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that MAFTA will make it a lot easier for Australians to do business in Malaysia. More Australian business executives and senior managers will be permitted to work in Malaysia and they will be able to stay for longer periods. It will also benefit families by improving access to visas for spouses and dependants of Australians working in Malaysia as well. MAFTA would also provide stronger protection for our intellectual property rights and establish a framework for mutual recognition of qualification and licensing requirements for professionals and also to facilitate electronic commerce as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">MAFTA has identified five priority areas for economic and technical cooperation. Projects in these areas would build on existing links and strengthen bilateral relations between a range of Malaysian and Australian organisations. In return, Australia would lock in faster tariff-free entry for Malaysian goods into Australia provided for under the AANZFTA, putting Malaysia on a par with Singapore. MAFTA would bring forward Australia's AANZFTA commitment to eliminate all our tariffs on entry into force now rather than in 2020 under the AANZFTA. This would accelerate tariff elimination for products such as automotive vehicles, textiles and clothing, and some manufactured goods as well. Malaysia is not a major supplier of these products within the Australian market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would make some limited AANZFTA-plus service commitments. Specifically, Malaysian investment in private hospital services would be covered by our obligations under MAFTA. Malaysian investors will be allowed to fully own research and development services, technical testing and analysis services, and some of the preceding works that occur at construction sites as well. Importantly, MAFTA does not include provision for investor-state dispute settlement. Overall, there would be little if any negative impact for Australian industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement is primarily about opening the markets and that is the main force behind it. But it will also do more than that. Australia has agreed to provide a three-year package of up to 21 short- and long-term scholarships, fellowships, awards and exchanges to support Malaysia's economic reform efforts. This complements existing exchanges between Australia and Malaysia on public sector and economic governance, including through the Endeavour Awards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreement will also provide for mutually beneficial economic and technical cooperation covering automotive, agricultural, tourism, clean coal technology and electronic commerce industries. An important element of this improved cooperation has already been achieved with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Australia's autoCRC and the Malaysian automotive institute. This memorandum of understanding is a first step in the greater collaboration between the Malaysian and Australian automotive industries that the agreement should promote. It will strengthen the economic relationship and reinforce what is already a very solid bilateral relationship as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon entry into force, MAFTA will reflect Australia's very close bilateral trade and economic, political and strategic relationship with Malaysia, and will enhance Australia's engagement in the region as we work together with Malaysia on issues of mutual interest. It will be an important part of the network of free trade agreements within our region that Australia is pursuing to advance our trade interests in the Asian century. The scale and pace of Asia's transformation has profound implications for Australia and for our bilateral and multilateral relationships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, Australia's objective in pursuing FTAs is to increase the prosperity of all Australians. We achieve this through negotiating genuinely liberalising agreements that eliminate or substantially reduce barriers to trade for the mutual benefit of the parties. I think everyone would agree that MAFTA meets this objective very well. Trade liberalisation under MAFTA could be expected to increase two-way trade between Australia and Malaysia, and boost real GDP for both our countries. Australians should welcome this agreement. MAFTA will deepen an effective economic integration between Australia and Malaysia. It will leave Australia well positioned and, in some cases, even better positioned in the Malaysian market as one of Malaysia's closest trading partners in ASEAN. The government is keen to ensure this groundbreaking agreement can enter into force as soon as it is possible to allow Australians to benefit from the improved opportunities for two-way trade and investment between our two countries. I commend this agreement. I also commend this legislation to the parliament and the many opportunities that it provides.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2012. I support the comments of the member for Stirling, and the member for Forrest, who I understand will also be speaking on this bill. This agreement was signed in May this year, but it is worth noting that its origins go back to the previous Howard government where the process was started in May 2005. It has been a seven-year journey to get us to where we are today. Also, from personal experience, I am very glad to see this bill before the parliament and to speak on it today. Before I entered parliament, I had the opportunity to travel to Malaysia and participate in trade exhibitions in Kuala Lumpur. I was involved in several successful contracts to export goods from Australia, particularly from the electorate of Hughes, to Malaysia. In dealing with Malaysians, I have found them to be very tough negotiators but at the same time very fair. It is great to see this bill before the parliament today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to note how our exporters and how our businesses have been working a lot with Malaysia over the last decade. While the government introduced its white paper on Asia earlier this year—and we actually thought the government had only just discovered Asia—over the last decade we have seen two-way trade between Australia and Malaysia increase by more than 100 per cent. According to Austrade, at the moment there are about 3½ thousand Australian companies exporting to Malaysia each year and Austrade estimates that there are around 250 Australian companies with some form of representation in Malaysia. Our businesses have been out there, engaging with Malaysia and increasing the two-way trade. However, although we have seen an increase in our trade with Malaysia over the last decade, we currently have a large trade imbalance. At the moment, Malaysia is our 10th largest trading partner, only behind China, Japan, the US, Singapore, the UK, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Thailand and Germany. However, last year we imported $9.9 billion worth of goods and services from Malaysia, but we are only exporting $6.1 billion worth of goods to Malaysia. We do have a fairly large trade imbalance with Malaysia at the moment. We also have an imbalance with our investments with Malaysia. While Malaysian investments in Australia last year totalled $14 billion, Australian investments in Malaysia for the last year totalled only $5.7 billion. So we have a fair way to go to catch up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the particular trade between Australia and Malaysia for 2011, most of the Australian goods that we exported to Malaysia were crude petroleum, which was worth $760 million; copper, $648 million; coal, $344 million; and wheat, $303 million. They were major exports. In our services sector to Malaysia last year education related travel was a total of $759 million—quite significant amounts of money. For our imports from Malaysia, crude petroleum is currently one of our major imports at over $3 billion. We are also importing $646 million worth of monitors, projectors and televisions from Malaysia. Another $556 million worth of computers are imported from Malaysia, and a further $378 million of refined petroleum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the details of this bill, we should firstly note that even before this bill came in, much of the merchandise trade between Australia and Malaysia already takes place at either zero or very low tariffs. When the scoping study was undertaken, one of the things that was noticed about the impediments to our trade between Australia and Malaysia, was that Malaysia not only has tariffs but also has further barriers with non-tariff measures such as import licensing and quotas, which restrict our exports to Malaysia, especially in agricultural products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This free trade agreement will see the elimination of 94.8 per cent of Malaysia's tariff lines for exports of Australian goods to Malaysia. That will increase to 98.6 per cent by 2016. In return, Australia will simply eliminate all tariffs on Malaysian goods. We will also benefit by Malaysia removing the quantitative restrictions on their car imports, and they will increase tariff quotas on a number of agricultural products. We are looking for more sales of our agricultural products, especially liquid milk and rice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, here in Australia, when we negotiate these free trade agreements—which everyone on the coalition side is in agreement with—we must remember that there are some impediments to our two-way trade and things that will put our nation at a competitive disadvantage. Malaysia, our 10th largest trading partner, does not have a carbon tax, so where we are putting a carbon tax on goods produced in Australia and we have a free trade agreement with Malaysia it will simply transfer the production of those goods from Australia, where that tax is paid, to Malaysia, where that tax is not paid. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, our economic relationship with Malaysia is very strong. This bill should strengthen it and lead to further strong ties between our two countries.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  International trade is the lifeblood of the Australian economy, and nobody knows this as much as a Western Australian like myself. We have an economy of around $217 billion, of which exports of goods and products make up $121 billion, or 55 per cent. With only 10 per cent of the nation's population, Western Australia generates 16 per cent of Australia's economy and 46 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports. Malaysia is a vital part of the WA trade scene. After all, we are closer geographically than the eastern states and we see Malaysia as a key market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of Australia's key exports into Malaysia, including petroleum, copper, coal and wheat, come from Western Australia. These four products account for nearly half of our exports to Malaysia. With a population of over 28 million, Malaysia represents a significant opportunity for Australian produce and, I hope, particularly for Western Australian produce and those producers in my electorate in the south-west. It is an opportunity that should be developed. Currently, our merchandise exports to Malaysia are valued at $5 billion and we import product worth $9 billion from Malaysia. So the trade balance is currently weighted in favour of our partners, which really should give us significant scope to move in this new agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also remain slightly behind in services trade between the two nations, which includes bilateral trade in the education and travel markets. There is also a significant level of investment by each nation in each other. Malaysia's investment in Australia stood at nearly $14 billion in 2011 and Australia held nearly $6 billion worth of Malaysian investments. From all of this we can see the importance of Malaysia to Australia in general and Western Australia in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this process, however, it is important to take a moment to consider the wider impact of trade agreements on the Australian economy. Australia has been a long-term proponent of loosening the restrictive trade practices we see throughout the world, and we were a driving force in the Doha round of trade talks and remain active in UN trade negotiations. Naturally we do this with an acknowledgement of vested interest. We are an exporting nation, after all. Unfortunately, we have not always been able to bring the world with us in what we are trying to achieve. Many countries remain protective, particularly of their primary industries—and, from someone in the agricultural sector, it is something that has certainly been an issue for agriculture and primary production in this nation—and they do restrict attempts at trade liberalisation for primary production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a significant problem for Australia given that primary production comprises such a large part of our exports. Minerals and petroleum account for nearly half of the exports, but we should note that, according to the Western Australian Department of Mines and Energy, Western Australia produces 68 per cent of the country's mineral and energy exports. We should also be aware that agricultural product exports are worth nearly $30 billion, or 10 per cent of total Australian exports. And we know that it was our agricultural exports that kept Australia out of technical recession during the period of the global financial crisis—something that was underestimated and undervalued. Therefore, fair and equitable access to food markets around the world is of paramount importance to Australian trade. It is also of critical importance to the incomes of food producers and manufacturers in this country, despite the resistance of countries that seek to protect their own agricultural producers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was this need that drove Australia to Doha in an attempt to continue to push market deregulation. There is, however, no greater acknowledgement of the lack of equity in trade than the failure of the world to deliver on the Doha round of world trade talks. This process has now been acknowledged as having produced nothing concrete in a decade of discussions and a lot of talk that has cost a lot of money—millions of dollars. Even World Trade Organisation Director General Pascal Lamy is on record as saying that the process of trade liberalisation and equalisation is failing. Last year he stated that the political gap between member states is 'not bridgeable'. In addition, EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht told European lawmakers that there was no reason to be optimistic that the negotiations could be concluded successfully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, this process is failing because the market is currently neither free nor fair in a lot of instances and too many nations have an obvious self-interest in protectionism to allow for an outcome that provides trade liberalisation across a larger number of countries. No foreign developed nation has been or is likely to be willing to sacrifice their own industries or their own farmers in the name of free trade because, in most nations, that probably would be political suicide. And no developing nation has been or is likely to be willing to slow the growth of wealth accumulation for their citizens in order to raise the standard of living in other countries—because this is what it means in practical terms to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while international trade is a free market by definition, it requires national self-sacrifice, and that is what we have seen in Australia—a lot of sacrifice. This price is too high for many nations of the world. That is why there has been a shift in world trade policy from broad encompassing trade agreements—the so-called multilateral agreements—to the current focus on bilateral agreements between individual nations, such as the one that we are considering today. This shift was probably inevitable, if we recognise and acknowledge national interest as a major influence, and this could well continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is probably pertinent at this point to consider the impact on global economic trends on the likely future of international trade agreements. There is little doubt that a number of developed nations around the world are facing impending financial crisis, and this will impact on the process. Sovereign nations with massive debt levels and no short- to medium-term capacity to reach budget surplus positions stand at the edge of a fiscal abyss, and the current trend of increasing debt and printing more money—the so-called quantitative easing—will not hide forever the insolvent position some countries may well find themselves in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike Labor, the coalition does not follow the economic strategy of ignoring debt now and allowing future generations to pay it off. Delaying the pain, as we know, may be just a short-term political fix but it is long-term economic suicide and structural debt and deficit. The short-term politics, however, continue to be a paramount driving force and there are more uncertain times ahead in the world. It means that easy markets will be hard to find in the near future and countries are likely to tighten rather than loosen their trade restrictions. As I said earlier, agriculture has been and probably will continue to be a sticking point in many free trade agreements. I know that historically primary producers in this country have often felt as though they were essentially traded away in that process. This international marketplace in Australia produces, without question—and I am very proud of what we produce in this country, as one of those producers—some of the world's best-quality and most efficiently produced agricultural and food products and high-quality manufactured goods, and we will always struggle to compete on price alone in that environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an opportunity in this free trade agreement with Malaysia for many products that come out of my electorate: orange juice, wine, beef, lamb, horticulture, high-value products and a range of niche products. Many countries, as we know, provide advantages for their industries that include low-input labour costs and low levels of compliance with government regulations. These in turn provide cost advantages to their products, and we know about the additional cost of the carbon tax. I see the member for Wannon sitting here. He and I both share a great concern about the dairy industry and its capacity to compete with the increased cost of a carbon tax on every litre of milk you will cool on your farm—and there are nine billion litres of those on farms having to be cooled—let alone your other inputs. Local producers are inundated with compliance on costing issues, like the carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In such a world marketplace, bilateral trade agreements are going to be essential. It is also going to be essential, however, to monitor and manage free trade agreements to ensure that the outcomes are delivered and that both parties receive the benefits that were planned. There remains in Australia perhaps a lack of follow-up after the signing of trade covenants. Trade agreements need to be held accountable for the outcomes that they deliver. The current proposal comes at a cost to the Australian budget of $80 million, which to some may not sound like a lot of money in the entire $370 billion annual budget, but essentially every dollar really does need to be properly accounted for. We do know about the current level of debt and deficit and we do need to make sure that every single dollar is accounted for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement, like all our trade agreements, does need to be analysed and real intangible benefits need to be demonstrated as having returned to the Australian economy. On that basis I am desperately hoping that this Malaysia free trade agreement brings real benefits not just to the broader economy but also that flow through to the grassroots level to those who are producing—particularly in the primary production areas—so that they actually achieve some tangible benefit from this particular agreement.</span>

The bills do this by setting out when goods can be regarded as of Malaysian origin, to take advantage of the free-trade provisions. Australian exporters and producers are able to access preferential treatment under the free trade agreement when sending goods to Malaysia. The agreement, which was signed on 22 May this year by the minister for trade and his Malaysian counterpart, Mr Mustapha Mohamed, recognises the importance of Malaysia as a market for Australia. The agreement also diversifies our trade relationship by opening Malaysia's services sector to Australian companies. </span>

We know that the Victoria Cross is awarded for conspicuous bravery, some daring or pre-eminent act of valour, self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy. In the 2010 battle of Derapet in Uruzgan province—yet another battle where Australian soldiers were significantly outnumbered—we saw Daniel, as part of Delta Company, 6th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, do exactly what the Victoria Cross acknowledges. </span>

I think that is what it is going to happen with this particular story. Not only is it a true Australian story; it is actually one that deserves by its very nature, by the actions of Daniel and others in Delta Company, to be told again and again—not least because of the courageous actions of Corporal Keighran and his comrades but also because of the inherently Australian circumstances in which Daniel was made aware that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, Daniel had been transferred to the active reserves, who are affectionately known as 'chockos'. He was in a new career and was someone who, to his workmates, seemed to be a quiet, ordinary bloke, working with them 12 hours a day in an underground goldmine in the Kalgoorlie Boulder goldfields of Western Australia. That is where he was. He is someone who, by his own admission, does not like to talk about himself. So no-one knew what Daniel had done. This is the man who is described by his driller workmates at La Mancha's Frog's Leg underground goldmine—and you might recognise this description—as unassuming, an average bloke, laid back, humble, a good bloke and an absolute champion. They are all descriptions that have been made of Daniel. And that is what most of us would think: 'This is a quiet, unassuming, seemingly ordinary man working in an underground mine.' But he has done extraordinary things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then at the time he gets a call to a meeting at Kalgoorlie airport during a work break—down the mine and now we are off to the airport. This is where it is such a great Australian story, not only what happened in the battle of Derapet but this. I can only imagine the reaction of the patrons at Angies Bar and Kiosk at the outback airport terminal when Lieutenant General David Morrison delivered the letter on approval by the Queen from Government House to Dan. It is also quintessentially Australian that Daniel's wife Kathryn knew nothing about his actions or his bravery at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, you might think—and there might be a movie made about this one day, where Kathryn will see what happened at Derapet—Kathryn was not impressed. It reminds me of the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">A Town Like Alice</span>. You remember how that movie started? This I think is the script for another movie. She was not really impressed. You can see the movie starting with Kathryn and Dan going to the airport and then we will see the battle unfolding after that. I should be a movie producer. Kathryn was not really impressed when she first heard exactly what he had done at Derapet. She was not impressed, I suspect, with the risks he had taken and probably not impressed that she knew nothing about it. She did not know about his actions or his bravery either. Again typically Australian, when asked how Daniel had taken the fuss and publicity surrounding the Victoria Cross, Kathryn said she expected him to be back behind the wheel of his truck: 'We have to pay the bills.' There are some pretty good Australian comments in that one. I want to read the citation into the record. This is what the Victoria Cross citation says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">FOR the most conspicuous acts of gallantry and extreme devotion to duty in action in circumstances of great peril at Derapet, Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan as part of Mentoring Task Force One on Operation Slipper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Corporal Daniel Alan Keighran deployed to Afghanistan in February 2010 with the 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 24 August 2010 he was a member of a partnered fighting patrol with soldiers of the Afghan National Army's 1st Kandak, 4th Brigade, 205th (Hero) Corps which was engaged by a numerically superior and coordinated enemy attack from multiple firing points in three separate locations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The attack was initiated by a high volume of sustained and accurate machine-gun and small arms fire which pinned down the combined Australian and Afghan patrol and caused a loss of momentum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the early stages of the attack, and upon realising that the forward elements of the patrol needed effective fire support, Corporal Keighran and another patrol member moved under sustained and accurate enemy fire to an exposed ridgeline to identify enemy locations and direct the return fire of both Australian and Afghan machine guns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On reaching this position and with complete disregard for his own wellbeing, Corporal Keighran deliberately drew enemy fire by leaving the limited cover he had and moved over the ridgeline in order to positively identify targets for the machine gunners of the combined patrol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After identifying some of the enemy firing positions, Corporal Keighran, under persistent enemy fire, continued to lead and mentor his team and move around the ridge to both direct the fire of the Afghan and Australian machine gunners and to move them to more effective firing positions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As the intensity of enemy fire grew, Corporal Keighran returned to the crest of the ridgeline to identify targets and adjust the fire of Australian light armoured vehicles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">His actions resulted in the effective suppression of enemy firing points, which assisted in turning the fight in the favour of the combined patrol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Moving to a new position, Corporal Keighran deliberately and repeatedly again exposed himself to heavy enemy fire to assist in target identification and the marking of the forward line of troops for fire support elements whilst simultaneously engaging the enemy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Realising that the new position provided a better location for the patrol's joint fire controller, Corporal Keighran moved over 100 metres across exposed parts of the ridgeline, attracting a high volume of accurate enemy fire, to locate and move the fire controller to the new position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He then rose from cover again to expose his position on four successive occasions, each movement drawing more intense fire than the last, in order to assist in the identification of a further three enemy firing points that were subsequently engaged by fire support elements. During one of these occasions, when his patrol sustained an Australian casualty, Corporal Keighran with complete disregard for his own safety, left his position of cover on the ridgeline to deliberately draw fire away from the team treating the casualty. Corporal Keighran remained exposed and under heavy fire while traversing the ridgeline, in order to direct suppressing fire and then assist in the clearance of the landing zone to enable evacuation of the casualty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Corporal Keighran's acts of the most conspicuous gallantry to repeatedly expose himself to accurate and intense enemy fire, thereby placing himself in grave danger, ultimately enabled the identification and suppression of enemy firing positions by both Australian and Afghan fire support elements. These deliberate acts of exceptional courage in circumstances of great peril were instrumental in permitting the withdrawal of the combined Australian and Afghan patrol with no further casualties. His valour is in keeping with the finest traditions of the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That description, whilst extensive, explains very graphically exactly what Daniel did. We do know that Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, who was killed in this battle, was one of Daniel's mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this event, Daniel has been nicknamed Prince Harry. I suspect it is something to do with the red hair and something to do with the exploits. Having been to Afghanistan and to Uruzgan province, and having seen the conditions that our Defence members work and operate in, and knowing exactly what Daniel did and how he did it, I think he is a very worthy recipient of the Victoria Cross. We measure the value and worth of our Australian Defence Forces not only because of their good work on the ground in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world but because of the fact that when they come home, they act like ordinary blokes. Daniel fit right back into his community and went back to work, with nobody having any idea of what he had gone through. I think that is a measure of the man. I am very proud of what Daniel achieved and the fact that he has been awarded the Victoria Cross.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I want to thank the previous speaker for her contribution and for outlining the heroism and great gallantry of Corporal Daniel Keighran, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia on 1 November this year. I am honoured to say that I was present—it was a great privilege—when he was at the investiture for his VC. We know that he was awarded this distinguished, highest of military honours by demonstrating the most conspicuous gallantry and extreme devotion to duty in 2010 at Derapet in Uruzgan province in Afghanistan. His was an act which demonstrated again the commitment of our men and women deployed overseas as well as here at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Keighran grew up in Nambour in Queensland and enlisted in the Army in December 2000. He completed his initial training at the School of Infantry. He was based in 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, based at Enoggera Barracks in Brisbane. During his military career, Corporal Keighran was deployed to Malaysia, East Timor, Iraq and, most recently, Afghanistan. That was the deployment for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is the 99th Australian to be rewarded the Victoria Cross. It should be noted, importantly, that he is distinguished by the fact that he is the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment to receive this magnificent honour. A member of Delta Company from the 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, Corporal Keighran has continued the proud and distinguished history of those men. Delta Company is most famously remembered for fighting in the Battle of Long Tan during the Vietnam War, so it has a proud record. Having visited Afghanistan on several occasions I, like others, have witnessed the bravery, sacrifice and professionalism that our young sailors, soldiers and air men and women demonstrate on a daily basis. Like many other battalions deployed in Afghanistan the 6th Battalion suffered several casualties, sadly some fatal, during 2010. Despite this they endured and they achieved for us. They demonstrated numerous acts of bravery and enormous devotion to duty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 24 August 2010 the valour demonstrated by Corporal Daniel Keighran was so courageous, bold and selfless that his actions earned him Australia's highest military honour. As we know from other contributions on that day Corporal Keighran and his patrol came under fire from a numerically superior enemy in Derapet. Under intense fire, the combined Australian and Afghan patrol was forced into a defensive position causing a loss of momentum and initiative. Corporal Keighran acted decisively and deliberately by repeatedly exposing himself to heavy enemy fire. His actions enabled the remainder of his patrol to regain the tactical initiative and coordinate their collective firepower to force the enemy from the battlefield.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The success of this engagement can be attributed directly to the bravery of Corporal Keighran. A typically humble Australian, a humble country lad, Corporal Keighran chose not to burden his wife, Kathryn, with the story of his actions until the weeks preceding his investiture at Government House. I was talking to the Chief of Army, Lieutenant-General Morrison, who retold his trip to Kalgoorlie when he went there to inform Corporal Keighran that his award had been approved by the Queen. That was when he was forced to tell his wife the story. Explaining this, Daniel said: 'It wasn't that I couldn't talk about it, it's just that what happened over there is for me and for the boys. But she knows now and she wasn't too impressed at first.' Can you imagine why? Aren't those words telling? That demonstrates very clearly one of the key attributes of Australian fighting men and women. They see themselves as part of a team, part of a group, where individuals are not singled out in the way in which we do appropriately single out such brave men and women. Clearly, at that point at least, he did not want to be seen to be doing something different or enormous; he was doing his job with his mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This story is not without sorrow because on this dreadful day Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney lost his life in that same battle. I well recall the previous motions of condolence made in reference to the death of Lance Corporal MacKinney in 2010. His death deeply affected and will continue to affect his family, his mates in the Defence Force, the Defence Force generally and the wider community. As his citation describes, Corporal Keighran's bravery significantly contributed to the medical evacuation of his mate Jared to Tarin Kot. From his citation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Corporal Keighran remained exposed and under heavy fire while traversing the ridgeline, in order to direct suppressing fire and then assist in the clearance of the landing zone to enable the evacuation of the casualty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The young gentleman here is a man who has been to war. As I have said before in this place, it is relatively easy for us in the serenity of these surrounds to talk about war. The fact is we have not experienced it. To understand precisely what confronted Corporal Keighran in those moments can only be for those who have had that experience. We wonder at their valour, we wonder at their selflessness and we wonder at their bravery and their commitment to one another. As with generations past, the current generation of men and women in the Defence Force are members of an extremely honourable profession. They deserve our adulation for the work they do for us. They serve their nation with distinction and forever place duty ahead of their own personal safety. That is amplified magnificently by the heroism of Corporal Keighran. It is because we have such men and women like Corporal Keighran, prepared to sacrifice so much of themselves, that Australians enjoy the freedoms we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an unofficial but moving tribute to the importance of the Victoria Cross that all members of the Defence Force salute a Victoria Cross winner, from the Chief of the Defence Force right through to the ranks. Perhaps the most telling moment of the investiture was when the Chief of the Defence Force fronted up to Corporal Keighran; Corporal Keighran stood and the Chief of the Defence Force saluted him. A very moving occasion. I work closely with the Defence Force, and I know the value they place on a salute. To see our foremost military officer, the CDF, offer a salute to a corporal, is a remarkable and moving moment. This mark of respect recognises the extreme courage and valour of those few men who have demonstrated their bravery under the most telling of circumstances and been awarded a Victoria Cross.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really difficult for us who have not been there to understand the circumstances that may have confronted this brave man on that day. I see a weapon and I shake. To have one pointed at me and to have a group of people firing at me, to be under heavy fire—I am not sure what I would do. But this man, trained as he was, a competent, confident professional, was able to achieve something magnificent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, on behalf of a grateful nation, I am pleased to join the members of the Australian Defence Force in saluting Australia's latest Victoria Cross winner, Corporal Daniel Keighran.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I rise tonight to support the speeches given by the member for Lingiari and the member for Forrest. Those two speeches are the only two I have heard on this motion, but I commend both speakers for the way that they have spoken about an Australian hero: Daniel Keighran, our latest VC winner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not go into the detail that both those previous speakers have gone into, but I will add a couple of points. The first is that, to me, what Daniel Keighran showed above all else was true leadership, in that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for his mates. I do not think you can get stronger leadership than that. It was done in a humbling way; it was done in a self-effacing way; it was done in a way where he just did what he thought was right and what he thought any Australian should do in the same circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What he did was put his life at risk. It is quite clear from the descriptions of the battle that he did that, and he did it on more than one occasion. He also did it to try to save the life of his mate. He was prepared to risk his life, to put his life on the line, to save the life of his mate who lay injured, wounded and dying on the battlefield. That is leadership. Having done all that, there was no skiting, no returning to Australia to be a hero and boasting to his mates, and telling everyone how great he was; it was return to Australia and carry on with his life. As far as he was concerned, what he had done was what anyone else should do in that situation. Whether they would or not is the big question. The reason he has received the VC, I think, is the answer to that question. He showed unique qualities in what he did on that battlefield and he deserves to be recognised and rewarded for that. As the previous speaker mentioned, he deserves to have the head of the Army salute him for what he did that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extraordinary to look at other VC winners and see what they have done. When I heard of Corporal Keighran's story, it reminded me of the VC winner from my electorate, Ted Kenna, who next year will be commemorated in Hamilton with the unveiling of a statue in his honour. Ted Kenna was awarded the VC and his citation states: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Near Wewak, New Guinea, when fire from a Japanese bunker was holding up the company's advance, Private Kenna stood up in full view of the enemy less than 50 yards away and engaged the bunker, firing his Bren gun from the hip. The enemy returned the fire and bullets actually passed between Private Kenna's arms and body. He remained completely exposed and went on firing until his magazine was exhausted, when he continued with a rifle. As a result of his gallantry the bunker was taken without further loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, we see a VC winner who was prepared to put his life on the line to protect his fellow mates. I cannot wait for the unveiling of the statue for Ted Kenna. I place on record my thanks to the local RSL for pushing ahead with the initiative. I congratulate the state government for putting in a contribution, some $25,000 to help with this statue. I mention in a very non-political way to the member for Lingiari that the local RSL has written to the federal government seeking a contribution. I would like them to give a contribution. I think that this statue and what the VC winner has done deserves the federal government to also play its part. The community is doing the same. The local Rotary club has launched a framed picture of Ted Kenna, which local community members can buy for $500. The community has been doing its bit and purchasing these commemorative photos. It would be fantastic if the federal government could support the community, the local RSL and the state government and make its contribution as well. There is a reason that the federal government should think about that. I would like to leave the chamber with a poem written by Arthur Haskell, in June 2011, called <span style="font-style:italic;">True Valo</span><span style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span>. It was written for what Ted Kenna did, but it could also have quite easily been written for our latest VC winner, Daniel Keighran.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="217266" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  I rise today to express the gratitude of the Ryan electorate to Corporal Daniel Keighran and to congratulate him on receiving the high honour of the Victoria Cross for Australia. While this honour has been bestowed on him for a number of acts of bravery in the Battle of Derapet, there is one act in particular which resonates in the hearts of the residents of Ryan. Many speakers before me have highlighted the details of the battle and Corporal Keighran's bravery, but today I wish to focus on the corporal's efforts to save a soldier from our own Ryan military family: Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. Corporal Keighran chose to risk his life to draw insurgent fire away from soldiers treating the wounded lance corporal. Although, tragically, Lance Corporal MacKinney did not make it, we are grateful for Corporal Keighran's brave efforts to help his fellow soldier, who was a husband, father, son and brother and a member of the Gallipoli Barracks community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1856, the Victoria Cross has been awarded to servicemen who have shown gallantry in action, through self-sacrifice and extreme devotion to duty in the face of the enemy. Australia has a deep respect for and pride in the Victoria Cross, with 99 Australian recipients in the award's history. Our Australian War Memorial has 61 of these medals on display, in what is the largest publicly held collection in the world. This award has deep meaning and significance for our nation. It is fitting that Corporal Keighran, who has exemplified the qualities recognised by the Victoria Cross, be the 99th Australian recipient. The corporal follows in the footsteps of a fellow Queenslander, Keith Payne VC, OAM, who is the last living Australia recipient of the original Victoria Cross before the change to the Victoria Cross for Australia in 1991.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Gallipoli Barracks in my electorate and also being a military mother, I am proud of the achievements of all of our soldiers who consistently show honour and dedication to the service of our nation. During this parliamentary term, we have mourned the loss of many Australian heroes. Today we are able to celebrate the courage of a young man who fought alongside some of those we have lost and who, despite the grief and trauma of losing his colleagues, was able to persevere with the vital work being done in Afghanistan. Corporal Keighran has continued to serve Australia with pride and dedication. He will remain a strong role model for young Australians. His qualities of comradeship, duty and honour in extraordinary circumstances have been recognised with this prestigious award.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our mission in Afghanistan has at times been controversial in its purpose and its duration. However, the work of Australian forces is unquestionably of vital importance to ensuring freedom and security for the Afghan people. Corporal Keighran fought for this liberty and peace against the insurgents, and he has made a significant contribution to the Australian mission and to the lives of many people in Afghanistan. It is with great respect and admiration for the acts of bravery of Corporal Keighran in assisting Lance Corporal MacKinney, and for the corporal's contribution to the overall effort in Afghanistan, that I congratulate Corporal Keighran on his high honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that Lance Corporal MacKinney's family—including his wife, Beckie, daughter, Annabell and son, Noah—and the Gallipoli Barracks community are grateful for the efforts of Corporal Keighran. He has shown tremendous strength of character through his unwavering mateship in protecting his fellow Australians and furthering the mission for peace in Afghanistan. The Victoria Cross for Australia, our nation's highest military honour, is well deserved. I congratulate him and I thank him and his family for their sacrifice and service to our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  Australians are justifiably proud of all of our service men and women. We recognise the dangers they face and we admire their commitment, courage under fire, professionalism, skill and capability. We all grieve when we lose one of them. We honour them for their remarkably brave and ongoing efforts in the quest for a better, safer and more peaceful world. In recent months Australians have seen and endured the heartache of what serving our country can bring to those brave men and women. We have had eight Australian soldiers die in Afghanistan in 2012, taking the total to 39 deaths since Operation Slipper began in 2001. However, many, indeed any, brave action comes with the element of risk. On 1 November 2012, Royal Australian Regiment Corporal Daniel Keighran, 29 years of age, received the nation's highest military honour for his actions in repeatedly drawing enemy fire during a 2010 battle in which one of his comrades, one of his mates, one of his friends was killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporal Daniel Keighran is the third soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia and the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment, the first outside of the Special Air Service. According to the citation, the 6RAR soldier exposed himself with complete disregard for his own safety, breaking cover repeatedly to identify enemy locations when his patrol was engaged by numerically superior forces.<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney of 6RAR was shot and, sadly, killed during the battle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland born Keighran joined the Army in 2000. Prior to Afghanistan, he served in East Timor and Iraq. He was promoted to Lance Corporal in 2005 whilst within Mortar Platoon of the support company 6RAR. He was promoted to Corporal with the same unit in 2009. In 2011, he transferred to the active reserve. A real hero, Corporal Keighran chose not to speak of what happened in respect of his fallen comrade, only telling his wife<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>Kathryn<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>about the circumstances of the battle 13 days before his award was given. Corporal Keighran<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>put that great Anzac spirit of mateship first—a superb example of the fact that the tradition well and truly endures in a new generation, a generation showing itself to be every bit as brave and every bit as selfless as the long line of khaki who preceded it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victoria Cross for Australia was inaugurated in 1991. It is the highest Australian award in the Australian system of awards and honours. It was first awarded in January 2009 to Trooper Mark Gregor Donaldson, 40 years after the award to the last Australian recipient of the Imperial Victoria Cross, Warrant Officer Keith Payne in Vietnam in 1969. I had the pleasure of meeting Warrant Officer Payne VC at the unveiling of Wagga Wagga's Korean war monument on 20 February. The first Australian to receive a Victoria Cross was Captain Neville Howse, during the Boer War in 1900.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of the Riverina, a region which has a proud military history, know all about the importance of the awarding of a VC. All three arms of the military operate out of Wagga Wagga and the many monuments erected in cities and towns across the region bear remembrance and respect from grateful communities for those who served, and especially those who fell in past conflicts. Among the Riverina's VC recipients is unmistakably Tumut's greatest hero, Private Edward John Francis Ryan, known sentimentally as Jack. His medal is proudly on display where it belongs, in the Australian War Memorial's Hall of Valour, alongside those awarded to other diggers, who by their selfless actions earned an honoured place in history. Jack Ryan earned his VC during an assault on the fabled Hindenburg Line as the 55th Australian Infantry Battalion attacked near Villacourt<span style="font-weight:bold;">,</span> France, on 30 September 1918. He had enlisted on 1 December 1915 at Wagga Wagga, and marched out that same day with 87 others, known as Kangaroos<span style="font-weight:bold;">, </span>passing through Harefield, Junee, Illabo and on to Sydney, arriving on 7 January. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That famous march is the subject of considerable discussion now by the Wagga Wagga Anzac Centenary Committee, organised by Petrina Quinn, as to how best to commemorate its impending centenary. The committee has talked about enhancing the inner sanctum of the memorial arch in the aptly named Victory Memorial Gardens as well as a partial re-enactment of that famous march. A replica banner of the original Kangaroos recruitment colours, which was carried all the way on that 1915 march, has been made with the help of the Wagga RSL club and is presently housed at the local RSL sub-branch. It was proudly paraded for the first time at this year's Wagga Wagga Anzac Day march along Baylis Street. Dr Quinn had the honour of meeting Daniel Keighran VC at this month's Remembrance Day commemoration in Martin Place, Sydney, describing him as a 'most modest and unassuming individual'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other VC recipients with Riverina links include John William Alexander Jackson, from Gunbar. He was just 19 years of age when he was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1916 for courage under heavy fire while rescuing his comrades near Armentieres in France.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Private Jackson was the youngest Australian to be awarded a Victoria Cross and his was the first VC to be won by an Australian on the Western Front. Other VC recipients with links to the Riverina include Walter Ernest Brown at Villers-Bretonneux, in France, in 1918.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A VC was also won by John Hurst Edmondson from Wagga Wagga, who was awarded his VC posthumously after he died rescuing his officer who was under attack in Tobruk, in Libya, in 1941. There was also Reg Roy Rattey, from Barmedman, whose actions in South Bougainville in 1945 earned him, rightly, the highest honour for valour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Daniel Keighran joins those celebrated heroes and, although his service is now as a reservist while he works in a Kalgoorlie mine, his military exploits stand as the epitome of heroism. Well done, Corporal Keighran VC. You are indeed a fine example to all who wear the military uniform and to all who enter the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka, near Wagga Wagga, hoping  for a soldier's career. A grateful, proud nation salutes you.</span>

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">I wish to add my personal condolences to the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the chamber yesterday on the death of Joe Riordan. Much has been said about Joe Riordan in recent days in this House, in the other house and in other places. It has been said that he was a loyal son of the labour movement. That is true. It has been said that he was a loyal son of the trade union movement. That is true. It has been said that he was a good family man. That is very true. It has been said that he was a good Catholic. I understand that to be true. All these things are true. But what I want to say today is that he also had a first-class intellect. He was a deep thinker, a fine communicator, an adornment to the labour movement and an adornment to this parliament.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;" />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">He served in the parliament for only three years. He was elected in 1972 and defeated in 1975. In 1975 he served briefly as Minister for Housing and Construction in the Whitlam government. His work for working people, for the Labor Party and for the labour movement would have justified a much longer term in parliament, as would his work for the people of the then seat of Phillip. But it was not to be. The sands of political fortune often do not discriminate against good people and hardworking members of parliament and, when that tide turned against the Labor Party, Joe Riordan's political career came to an end. But his working life certainly did not come to an end and his commitment to Australia did not come to an end.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">He went on to serve as head of the New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations, as Senior Deputy President of the Australian Workplace Relations Commission, or the Industrial Relations Commission as it was then known. He served in a number of capacities as chair and deputy chair of government boards and instrumentalities, all of which he put a great effort into and made a great contribution to. He saw none of them as a reward for effort or services rendered; he saw all of them as an opportunity to continue to contribute.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">In a previous capacity before entering parliament I had the opportunity to work tangentially with Joe Riordan when he conducted a review of the hire car industry in New South Wales. I actually recommended him to the then government to conduct that review, along with the Hon. Milton Morris, a former Liberal Minister for Transport in  New South Wales, because I knew he would bring rigour, intellect and thought to that process.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;" />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">I did not know Joe Riordan well but I do know his family well, particularly two of his sons, Peter and Bernie, both of whom I would regard as friends. Joe Riordan instilled in both of </span>
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">them the Labor ethos and the commitment and service to the nation as well as of course family values and, I am sure, the faith which is shared in the family.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do wish, personally in this chamber, as I have done directly to Bernie, to extend my condolences to his widow, Patricia, and to their children, John, Peter, Michael, Bernie, Kathy and Maureen, who I know would be feeling the loss of their father deeply, feeling the loss of his presence in their family and his ongoing guidance. But they can also justly be proud of his contribution not only to their family but to our nation, a contribution which is not duly recognised by his three years of service, which was actually much deeper and longer lasting than that. Frankly, for many of those people who served in this parliament for a short time of three years, 40 years later it would be unusual for them to be recognised in significant speeches in this House and in the other House, but Joe Riordan's contribution in a short period in this House was enormous. His contribution throughout his life was remarkable. He will be missed but his life will also be celebrated and remembered by many.</span>

He was the nephew of Darby Riordan, the Labor member of the House of Representatives for Kennedy from 1929 to 1936. Joe married Patricia Watkins in 1955, and they had six children. From 1958 to 1972 he was the federal secretary of the Federated Clerks Union, a bastion of anticommunist social democrats. Riordan was elected as the Australian Labor Party member for the federal seat of Phillip at the 1972 election. He was the Minister for Housing and Construction from June 1975 until the dismissal of the Whitlam government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke this afternoon to the Country Party member for Riverina at that time, John Sullivan, who at age 83 has just been re-elected to the Narrandera Shire Council. John wanted me to record his comments about his former colleague. He said he was old-style Labor. He said he was there on behalf of the people. 'He was a gentleman who always had reasoned debate. He was never vitriolic about anyone or anything.' Mr Sullivan was quite fond of Joe Riordan, as were—as we have heard in many of the eloquent speeches in this place—many of the people who knew him. They may not have served with him, but they certainly knew of him and they knew the great contribution he made to the Commonwealth parliament. They knew of his great contribution to the Australian Labor Party. May Joe Riordan rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="JK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCLELLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  I compliment the speakers to the motion and the member for Riverina. Indeed, Joe Riordan was an old-style Labor representative. But, like so many of his generation, Joe was and remained a true believer, a genuine believer, of the Labor movement and all that it stood for. He was a staunch trade unionist all his life, and he was devoted to the welfare of his fellow Australians. Joe was a legend. He was a remarkable man. His service to Australia and Australians can now be written into Labor's folklore. For his outstanding service to this parliament and Australia he, quite properly, was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. Most appropriately, his AO was given pride of place on his coffin last Friday, and he would have been very proud. No-one could have been more deserving of such an honour than Joe Riordan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to speak about Joe, the man who I came to know so well. People before me have already mentioned the tremendous heights he climbed to in his career. Really, that continued until his 82nd year in the service of the people of Australia. Because of time constraints, suffice it for me to say that Joe always remembered his humble beginnings. He never forgot where he came from or who he represented. His enormous achievements are now renowned and we in the labour movement, but most especially his loving wife Pat, his four sons, two daughters and numerous grandchildren, have every reason to be enormously proud of his accomplishments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe left school at 15 years of age and in his lifetime through long experience, hard work and perseverance he graduated with an honours degree from the university of hard knocks. Indeed, may I say, it was touching to see not only every one of his immediate family at our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church at Caringbah last Friday but also the hundreds of others from all walks of life, from former prime ministers Hawke and Keating to an old knockabout from a long way back who Joe had helped in his capacity as a member of parliament to obtain a pension all those years ago. They all came to pay their respects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak about Joe as the man I knew. My father, Doug, and Joe were close friends from the 1950s. In the early days of their political lives they did not always agree with each other. They would often sit and discuss various options for the road ahead but they always remained good and loyal friends despite a few areas of disagreement. My dad and mum last visited Joe in Kareena Private Hospital at Caringbah about a fortnight ago. According to them, Joe's short-term memory was poor but his ability to recall longer-term events, they said, was really quite amazing. In talking about the old days, Joe dug out from the back of his mind comments on his old friends like Pat Hills, his predecessor in the seat of Phillip, Joe Fitzgerald, Fred Campbell, Charlie Oliver, Terry Sheahan and also his colleagues from the Whitlam times: Lionel Bowen, Les Johnson, who was also at the funeral, and Bill Morrison and of course not forgetting Gough himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe rekindled to my mother and father what is now quite a famous story. In the last months of the Whitlam government, Gough went up to Queensland to kick the football off in a game between New South Wales and Queensland—before the formal state of origin clashes. In those dying months it is fair to say that the Whitlam government was not the most popular government in Australia. After Gough kicked the ball off there were resounding boos and cries from the audience. Apparently, on the way back from the stadium, Gough said to Senator Ron McAuliffe, 'Comrade, we will have to look at your endorsement up here. I did not know you were so unpopular.' Joe apparently laughed with great gusto at the tale that he delivered to them. He also talked about the time that Pat and he visited my mother and father when they were residing in England. They were very content that that conversation had brought so much happiness to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to say that one of Joe's sons, Bernie, is one of my closest friends and with our respective families we often meet up and Joe would often attend. He was always very much part of the scene but in any discussion he would never hesitate to communicate his point of view, which was always pretty sound and pretty solid, and you walked away with no misunderstanding of what his point of view was. Terry Sheahan, the former president of the ALP, and Bernie last Friday gave two of the best eulogies I have ever heard and I compliment them on their wonderful tributes to Joe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time I saw Joe was when Bernie was sworn in as a commissioner for Fair Work Australia. I know Joe was tremendously proud of him and indeed of all his children and grandchildren. Joe was also a great friend of my former boss and mentor as a lawyer, Roy Turner, who started up the firm of what became Turner Freeman. In fact they were born and reared not far from each other in Surry Hills. I am proud and privileged to have had both of them involved in my early career as a lawyer. I could not have had two finer mentors than I had in such fine men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us who knew Joe Riordan are going to miss him terribly. People of his strength and quality are hard to find today. As the member for Riverina said, he was genuinely old Labor. His life was one of outstanding service, of devotion to his family and dedication to his fellow human beings. Joe was indeed a deeply religious man. He did not wear that on his sleeve but rather it was self-evident from his character and deeds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe, I know your wife, Pat, and every one of your family loved you. Your friends respected you for your sincerity of purpose, your enormous strength of character and your devotion to your fellow Australians. I thank you for your friendship to me and also for your wise counsel and I thank you for the enormous contribution you have made to Australia. You have indeed served us well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  I rise to pay my respects to Joe Riordan. The member for Barton so eloquently spoke and I know how close he was to the family and to Bernie in particular, one of the six children. I first met Joe Riordan in 1971. I had commenced with the Federated Storemen and Packers' Union, as it then was. I was a research officer and Joe was the secretary then of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. He was New South Wales based. He was one of those people who always struck me as being prepared to take on and nurture the younger generation coming on. I was fortunate in my career in the trade union movement that there were many of those mentors and supporters from all around the country. When we look at where the trade union movement went in the eighties and nineties, it was because of the foundation that was laid in the seventies—and Joe Riordan was an essential part of that foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He became secretary of the clerks union in 1970, having been its assistant secretary for a very long period before that. He made sure that the clerks union represented not just its members' interests; he grew the membership base of that union. He was not frightened by the advent of technology. I can remember in the early seventies people not wanting technological change because they thought it would put people out of work. This was a very common strain. But Joe, as the secretary of his union, not only understood the importance of it but also believed it should be accessible to all. He would have applauded, and did applaud, what this government has done with the National Broadband Network, enabling the whole of the country to be better connected and better served as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe went into the federal parliament in 1972 with the election of the Whitlam government. There was another overlap because while we lost Joe from the trade union movement he became an essential part of the Whitlam team, and my father was the Treasurer and subsequently Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam government. Interestingly, Sunday is the 40th anniversary of the election of that government and a great milestone, and our caucus talked about that today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe was a product of the Depression. He was a Sydney boy who grew up during that Depression, and that forged—like so many of them—the strong conviction for social justice and lifting people out of poverty, ensuring that those dreadful strains of recession/depression, no jobs and loss of dignity should not be repeated. If you listen to all the speeches that have been made about Joe, this commitment to social justice comes through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He became the minister for housing. He succeeded Les Johnson. His parliamentary term was all too short: two terms; three years. He lost in the 1975 election. On the day of the Dismissal, when the then Governor-General had dismissed Gough Whitlam, Fraser began a censure motion in the parliament against the government of the day. Immediately the parliament resumed after lunch, my father was on his feet having to defend the government against this censure motion. We—and when I say 'we' I mean the Labor Party, the then government; we still considered it to be the government—turned the censure against Fraser. The government passed a lack of confidence motion against Fraser when the penny dropped as to what the Governor-General had done. Interestingly, Joe Riordan said that when he came into the parliament—he had come in to sign ministerial correspondence—my father was on his feet and someone next to Joe said: 'Don't sign any more of that correspondence. You're sacked.' The commission had been withdrawn; he no longer had the authority. When we talk about pennies dropping, there were lots of them dropping all around the place. I will not go into the history of how all of that could have been avoided and what wrongs were done, except to make the point that it was a traumatic time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe did lose his seat. I think the parliament lost a great contributor—someone whose time was cut all too short. After that election, he went on to head up the New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations. Between 1986 and 1995, he was a senior member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. These were two areas in which I had a lot to do with him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was Joe's time before parliament, his engagement whilst he was in parliament, particularly through my dad, and then his life after parliament in the industrial relations sphere. The whole period from 1983 through to 1996 was spent on the development of the accords. The labour movement was engaged in advancing the social wage, superannuation, minimum wage rates, enterprise bargaining and transfer payments as part of the wages trade-off. There was all of that agenda, and we needed a framework in which to do it. The Industrial Relations Commission was an important part of that framework, and Joe Riordan played an essential role as a senior member of the industrial commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fittingly, his career ended as it started: he held the position of chair of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales. Joe was a person who gave a lifetime of commitment not just to the labour movement but also to the betterment of working Australians. This was a man who was always prepared to engage and who had the passion, the commitment and the conviction. He took the defeats and the successes, but he always moved on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to his lifetime of service not just to the labour movement but also to the country. I also offer my condolences to Joe<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s widow, Pat, and his six children—and Bernie is the one of them whom I know best of all. I offer my sincere condolences to them in the knowledge that Joe's was a proud contribution to a nation at a vital time. He went into all of these jobs with the very best of intentions: to serve the public. That was his conviction from his early childhood, and he discharged it with great vigour and with great distinction.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  Today I want to pay tribute to the admired and much-loved author Bryce Courtenay. He died last week at home in Canberra aged 79. Bryce Courtenay was a master storyteller. He left an indelible mark through his writing on Australia and, for that matter, on the world. He was forever endearing, continually animated and always passionate about writing and a good yarn. He was a mentor, a friend and a true advocate for storytelling, the importance of reading and the importance of literacy. Above all, Bryce Courtenay's writing encouraged countless people to discover or rediscover the joy of books and reading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bryce Courtenay always wanted to be a storyteller. That, according to his publisher and friend Bob Sessions, was his calling from the age of seven, when he wrote his first story. Despite growing up in a small village in the Lebombo Mountains in the Limpopo Province of South Africa, Bryce fell in love with words when he learnt English after his mother tongue of Afrikaans. This love of words would take him to the London School of Journalism, where he then met Benita Solomon, whom he followed to Australia. Clearly, growing up with the backdrop of World War II and the beginning of the apartheid era had a huge impact; it showed through his first and bestselling book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Power of One</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was always good with words and he developed his craft as a copywriter and a creative director. He in fact was also an advertising man. There is no question that he was creative and talented. In marketing he is associated with Louie the Fly, still an advertising icon—I saw one the other day—and the Milkybar Kid, another long-time icon. But these were everlasting marketing concepts. But, whatever the call of marketing, storytelling was his real calling. He loved to entwine a yarn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He wrote more than books; in many cases they are tomes! But they are such engaging, intertwined stories. He worked 12 hours a day writing them, publishing a book every year after <span style="font-style:italic;">The Power of One </span>was first published. He loved to tell the story, the history and the characters and stretch it through the eras, and that is what made him so endearing to his Australian fans. He wrote about his adopted home of Australia, including the Australian Trilogy: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Potato Factory</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Tommo &amp; Hawk </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">Solomon's Song</span>. He ignited an interest in Australian history in people who had never had one before. And he wrote about personal tragedy. In 1993 <span style="font-style:italic;">April Fool's Day </span>was published, telling the story of his youngest son, Damon, who was born with haemophilia and later contracted HIV/AIDS from a blood transfusion. From the ripping yarns to the heart-wrenching stories, his books adorned the Christmas trees and bookshelves of millions in Australia and the world. The annual report of the Australian government's Public Lending Right Committee shows that, of the 100 highest-scoring Australian books since 1974, 15 are by Bryce Courtenay, with four in the top 10.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a wordsmith Bryce Courtenay developed his craft as a copywriter and director first with George Patterson and, later, his own firm. I was delighted to see Bryce Courtenay together with his wife, Christine, at the Prime Minister's Literary Awards in July, supporting new and established Australian authors. He was there at the awards the year previously, and it was there that, in discussions with him, he offered his services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it turned out, we were embarking on the National Year of Reading campaign, which is run all through this year. I asked him to become a national ambassador for that campaign. He agreed immediately and was, as always, an enthusiastic ambassador to his love of story telling. Not so long ago, we celebrated the success of the Year of Reading, which started with an ambition of 1,000 events to be run nationwide through the year. In fact, it achieved 3,700 nationwide. No doubt, that growth in numbers was in part due to Bryce Courtenay's ambassadorship. The ongoing legacy means that there will be a new national campaign to promote early literacy and reading skills, with the Love to Read campaign and the Let's Read national campaign coming together to include literacy and promote libraries across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was honoured with an Order of Australia in 1995 and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Canberra in October 2012. It was Peekay in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Power of One </span>who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Man is a romantic at heart and will always put aside dull, plodding reason for the excitement of an enigma…mystery, not logic, is what gives us hope and keeps us believing in a force greater than our own insignificance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bryce Courtenay will be remembered for the excitement he brought with his books, with their romanticism, with their mystery and with their hope. My thoughts are with Bryce's wife Christine, his family and friends at this very difficult time. We salute a great Australian storyteller, a great Australian icon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  Bryce Courtenay once wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Intelligence is a harder gift. For this you must work, you must practise it, challenge it, and maybe toward the end of your life you will master it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, as we mourn his passing and celebrate his enormous contribution, we can reflect on how Courtenay mastered that intelligence and inspired all who read his books. Bryce Courtenay was a splendid storyteller whose legacy will live on as long as the printed word endures. His tales of South Africa and his adopted country, Australia, were extensions of his own life, although frequently embellished. Like his character Peekay in his award-winning book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Power of One</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Bryce was born in South Africa and brought up partly in an orphanage. During this time, Bryce often told stories and, just like Peekay, learned how to box to avoid being bullied.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born Arthur Bryce Courtenay in 1933, he spent most of his early years in a small village in the Lebombo Mountains. In 1955, while studying journalism in London, Bryce met his future wife Benita and eventually emigrated to Sydney. They married in 1959 and had three sons, Brett, Adam and Damon. Upon arriving in Australia, Bryce was not able to secure a job in journalism and so he started writing advertising copy. According to him, his plan was to work until he was 35 and then write novels but, with his son Damon being a haemophiliac, he needed a regular income and eventually reached the top of the advertising business. His award-winning campaigns included Louis the Fly, the original Milky Bar kid commercial and the Australian Labor Party's 1972 successful election campaign, It's Time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1989, Bryce achieved the goal of writing 'the great novel' with the release of his first book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Power of One </span>based loosely on his upbringing. Bryce Courtenay had a knack of writing and telling a story, but it was his 1993 tale of his son's struggle with haemophilia and later his death from acquired immune deficiency syndrome that inspired <span style="font-style:italic;">April Fool's Day</span>, brilliantly articulating a father's struggle with the death of a child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 23 years Bryce wrote 22 novels, aiming to release a book every November—just in time for Christmas. Even in his final weeks he managed to finish his final book <span style="font-style:italic;">Jack of Diamonds. </span>I am sure it will be a best seller. Bryce Courtenay told many a marvellous story of country Australia but one of my favourites would have to be his 1998 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Jessica</span>. Set in Narrandera, in the heart of my Riverina electorate, Bryce Courtenay penned the historical story of a young girl growing up in hard times. Courtenay painted a beautiful picture of this vibrant region which had fallen on hard times, in which Jessica's trials and tribulations were lived out near the banks of the mighty Murrumbidgee River. Narrandera is a place solely reliant on the water from the Murray-Darling system to sustain its growth and prosperity. The hard times those people face are, again, a cycle which unfortunately never ends for the hardworking and good people of my electorate, and it was certainly brought out in Bryce's wonderful book <span style="font-style:italic;">Jessica</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vale, Arthur Bryce Courtenay, a great storyteller of our time. His stories will be cherished through time and he will continue to be loved by children and adults alike. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, it's all about telling the stories. You gotta be able to tell the stories, I think.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I pay tribute to one of our greatest ever storytellers. Australian author Bryce Courtenay lived in the suburb of Reid in my electorate, a few kilometres from my electorate office. Last week he died of stomach cancer, aged 79. He was a prolific author. In his 23 years of writing he wrote 23 books—almost one a year. I say 'almost' because the only time he missed his annual deadline was last year. He was upset by this even though the arthritis in his hands were so severe he could only perform two-finger typing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As somebody who has a couple of books with my name on the spine of them I can only marvel at a man almost 40 years my senior who worked 12 hours a day, six days a week, for months on end to tell us his stories. I remember once reading a book about fiction writing which said that if you want to be a good fiction writer you have to be at the desk every day: some days the muse will come and sit on your shoulder and you will write beautiful prose, while other days the muse will not come and nothing will come out. But you have to be there, otherwise the muse will turn up and you will be off somewhere else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bryce Courtenay was there day in, day out, waiting for the muse to land on his shoulder and produce those wonderful stories. Great storytellers like Bryce Courtenay can inspire us. They fill us with vision and sometimes even tell us things we do not want to hear. Bryce Courtenay's power to tell a compelling story saw him sell more than 20 million books worldwide—nearly a book for every Australian. He wrote 12 of the most borrowed books in Australia's public libraries. It is estimated that one in three Australian households have a Bryce Courtenay book on their bookshelves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was it about Bryce Courtenay the man and the writer that so enthralled us? I believe it was his ability to tell stories about the strength and triumph of the human condition. His own life was testimony to that. It is hard to read <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ower of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ne</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">April Fools</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Day</span> without being touched by how he spoke to us on this eternal theme. In <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ower of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ne</span> he wrote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The power of one is above all things the power to believe in yourself, often well beyond any latent ability you may previously have demonstrated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bryce Courtenay, like all of us, was very much human—a man with his own imperfections—and he showed us through his life and his writing that we should not hide from them; the imperfections and hardships of life are what makes a story worth celebrating. Two weeks ago Bryce Courtenay posted a final message on YouTube to his readers. Here is part of what he said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well kids, here we go. The book coming out this year, <span style="font-style:italic;">Jack of Diamonds</span>, is my last book. It is my last book because my use-by date has finally come up, and I've probably got just a few months to live. I don't mind that—I've had a wonderful life—but part of that wonderful life has been those people who have been kind enough to pick up a Bryce Courtenay book, and read it and enjoy it and buy the next one, and be with me in what has been, for me, an incredible journey.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  I commend the previous speaker for his words and also those of the previous speakers who went before him. I was one of those Australians who picked up a Bryce Courtenay novel and are all the better for it. My favourite book in life is <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Power of One</span>. It is a book which, as a young man, grabbed me and I just loved it. I thought it was fantastic. It is loosely based on his own life and upbringing but, to me, it is a story that is told with perfection. It struck me when I read it—and it has never, ever left me—how the young 'Peekay' earned respect in life. He had to overcome extreme hardship, poverty and cruelty, yet he was so determined. He had that inner strength and inner belief and was absolutely determined to get through it all and to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the way he was able to do this was through his boxing. The description of the boxing matches in that book never, ever leave you. The descriptions of the combination punches that ultimately enabled him to overcome everything that was thrown against him were inspirational. It is a fantastic book. As I said, it is my favourite book. I wanted to come here tonight to the chamber to say thank you to Bryce Courtenay for writing such a book. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been told by the previous speaker, the member for Fraser, in his little YouTube clip Bryce Courtenay thanks those Australians and those people across the world who picked up his books and read them. I would like to say thanks to him for writing his books and, in particular, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Power of One</span>. It has had a big influence on my life and, I think, on many people's lives. He was a great storyteller, he was a great author. He has left a legacy with his books, which will mean his life is remembered in time immortal. Thank you very much, Bryce Courtenay.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) What recourse is available to downstream Australian businesses that employ and manufacture locally but believe that an anti-dumping decision has impinged upon their necessity to import materials from overseas because these materials are not accessible in the domestic market. </span>

Downstream Australian businesses that import materials from overseas that are not accessible in the Australian market may apply for such an exemption by writing to the National Manager, International Trade Remedies Branch, Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">From 2 July 2012 the Government has funded an International Trade Remedies Adviser (ITRA), located within the Australian Industry Group, to provide information and assist small and medium enterprises by periodically reviewing available data about downstream industries following the imposition of measures and assist with preparation of anti-dumping or countervailing applications in respect of those goods. If appropriate, the ITRA will refer matters relating to the dumping of downstream goods to me, as Minister, to determine whether there are grounds for a Minister-initiated investigation, consistent with the World Trade Organization agreements.</span>
