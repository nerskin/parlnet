<para>That the Senate record its deep sorrow at the death, on 19 February 2011, of Sapper Jamie Ronald Larcombe while on combat operations in Afghanistan, places on record its appreciation of his service to our country and tenders its profound sympathy to his family and friends in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Jamie Ronald Larcombe was born in 1989 in Kingscote, South Australia. He attended Parndana Area School, played football for Western Districts and was a local fire brigade volunteer. His life ambition was to serve his country. In 2008 he joined the Australian Army. Having successfully completed his recruit and combat engineer basic training in that year, he was posted to the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment based in Darwin. In 2009, Sapper Larcombe was deployed to Indonesia as part of the humanitarian Operation Padang Assist. In October last year he was deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Slipper.</para>
<para>On 19 February this year, while serving as a combat engineer with Mentoring Task Force 2, Sapper Larcombe was killed in action during an engagement with insurgents in the Mirabad Valley region of Oruzgan province. He was mortally wounded when his patrol was subject to a coordinated attack, which employed both machine gun and small-arms fire. Sapper Larcombe had just marked his third anniversary of Army life.</para>
<para>The commanding officer of Mentoring Task Force 2, Lieutenant Colonel Darren Huxley, says Jamie Larcombe was ‘a trusted sapper’, a ‘comrade in arms’ and a ‘mate’. During a service for Sapper Larcombe at Multinational Base Tarin Kowt, Lieutenant Colonel Huxley paid tribute in these terms:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Mateship is what defines the best in an Aussie Digger and Jamie was amongst our best. Jamie was a volunteer for his country, as we all here are. He knew the risks of his chosen profession and he accepted them. He shared the danger and austerity, but mostly, I am sure, he was driven by his desire to protect and support his mates. Jamie Larcombe is now part of our nation’s history and his name will echo in Anzac Day toasts long after all of us have gone.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">At the conclusion of the memorial service, more than 2,000 soldiers from six nations stood side by side to pay their final respects to Sapper Larcombe. It was a fitting tribute to a fine Australian.</para>
<para>Sapper Larcombe was loved by his family and respected by his peers. He died doing what he wanted to do: serving his country as a combat engineer in the Australian Army. Sapper Larcombe’s life ambition was to serve and he will forever be remembered for his service. The pain of his loss will not be lessened by any words we speak in this chamber today, but we do want to acknowledge his contribution and sacrifice, and pay our respect. I hope his partner, his parents and his sisters take some comfort from the esteem in which his memory is held and will forever be held.</para>
<para>I also acknowledge that an Afghan national, who was engaged as an interpreter, died in the same insurgent attack that killed Sapper Larcombe. Those interpreters and other support personnel are vital to our operations and to our troops. We offer our condolences to his family and regret his death enormously.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, this parliament on too many occasions in recent times has had to acknowledge the passing of an Australian solder. Sapper Larcombe is the 23rd Australian solider and the fifth Australian combat engineer to die in Afghanistan. Combat engineers are soldiers who build bridges and roads, clear landmines, and locate and disarm roadside bombs. They have paid a high price for their service in this conflict.</para>
<para>Three weeks ago, the Senate extended its condolences on the death of Corporal Richard Atkinson. Corporal Atkinson was a member of the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, also killed in action in Afghanistan. I extend my condolences to members of the regiment as they carry on with their dangerous mission in Afghanistan. I thank all our serving men and women in Afghanistan for the work they are doing in our name.</para>
<para>The government acknowledges that Australia’s participation in the International Security Assistance Force effort in Afghanistan has extracted a significant toll. The loss of life and the trauma of injury associated with this conflict is a lasting reminder of the dangers our Defence Force personnel confront each day. All of us in the parliament acknowledge the great responsibility we have when we support the commitment of Australian troops overseas and we certainly take that responsibility very seriously, and feel very much the loss or injury of Australian personnel. I know that a couple of senators have sons serving in the defence forces. Like all parents of those serving, I know they worry for them. Obviously the family of those soldiers who died pay a terrible price as well and our thoughts are with them. I want to acknowledge that we recognise not only their suffering but also the contribution that their children have made to the defence of Australia and its national interests.</para>
<para>I am sure I have the support of all the Senate when I say on behalf of the government and the nation that we convey our deepest condolences to those who knew and loved Sapper Larcombe.</para>

<para>—Last Saturday week Australia lost one of its finest, and with it a new name was added to our list of heroes. I talk of Sapper Jamie Larcombe, who was killed in action whilst serving in Afghanistan. The coalition joins the Senate in mourning the loss of this young Australian fighting to free Afghanistan from the bases and the curse of international terrorism. Sapper Larcombe’s life was taken too soon, in a worthy cause and in a selfless manner—as a volunteer. That is why his memory and legacy will live on forever not only in the hearts of his family but in an exceptionally proud and grateful nation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Jamie Larcombe was born in September 1989 on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. He was a community-minded person who volunteered at the local CFS. He was a keen Crows supporter and a footy player himself for the local Western Districts club. By all accounts the 21-year-old was a fun-loving individual who loved life and loved to give where he could. Our thoughts are with his parents, Steven and Tricia, his three sisters, Ann-Marie, Emily and April, and his partner, Rhiannon, who are suffering unimaginable sadness and grief. We are also thinking of the members of the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, who lost a good mate, and the close-knit community of Kangaroo Island, who lost one of their own, described and known locally as ‘an awesome bloke’.</para>
<para>It is right, it is proper and it is important that we give recognition to the young life laid down for our nation and the international community. We hope that no family ever has to experience that which Sapper Larcombe’s family has suffered. Yet he volunteered on our behalf so that we do not have to experience terrorism on our doorstep. I am again reminded of the words of Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith VC, our latest VC winner, when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para>I want my children to be able to live as everyone does now without the fear of getting on a bus and having it blow up.</para>
<para>I do what I do because I believe in the country that we live in. I believe that we are making a difference in stemming the flow of terrorism.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I urge everyone to remember that Sapper Larcombe was a hero. He was a young man who made the ultimate sacrifice, a volunteer in the service of his country. We are proud to stand behind the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. In Afghanistan they are fighting alongside armed forces of many other nations to ensure that the country is never again used as a base for international terrorism—a mission to ensure the security of all Australians and to make the world a safer place.</para>
<para>Of course, in that task many Afghanis are involved, and we note the passing of an interpreter in the same incident. Similarly, our thoughts and prayers are with the interpreter’s family. Whilst that family are far removed from Australia, I am sure that the pain and suffering they are going through is identical to that which the Larcombe family is experiencing as we speak.</para>
<para>The commanding officer of Mentoring Task Force 2, Lieutenant Colonel Darren Huxley, summed it up perfectly when he said that Sapper Larcombe was a young soldier who epitomised the core values of an Australian soldier. Let me quote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Jamie Larcombe is now part of our nation’s history and his name will echo in Anzac Day toasts long after all of us have gone.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was Sapper Larcombe’s life ambition to serve our great nation. He made the ultimate sacrifice to serve our country, embodying every aspect of the Anzac spirit. Today we pause to recognise his service and to record our gratitude and the thanks of a proud nation. May his service and sacrifice in the cause of freedom be an inspiration to all. A thankful nation salutes his volunteer spirit, his service and his sacrifice.</para>

<para>—I rise to concur with the remarks of Senator Evans and Senator Abetz. Sapper Jamie Ronald Larcombe was on engagement high in the Charniston Valley as part of Operation Geelong with Mentoring Task Force 2. As part of that operation their Bushmaster, for reasons I do not quite understand, was stopped. They dismounted from the Bushmaster and in the initial volley of fire both Sapper Jamie Larcombe and an Afghan interpreter were killed. They were medivaced out almost immediately but were unfortunately pronounced dead on arrival. What this goes to show is the precarious nature of this work, which is nonetheless absolutely essential. It is vitally important that we reflect this to Jamie’s family—his parents, Steven and Tricia, and his three sisters—who obviously have an immense amount of grieving to go through as they deal with the loss of the family’s only son.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Jamie grew up in the country area of Kangaroo Island. He was a person who applied himself to the things that so many people relate to—to football, to an involvement with his local bushfire brigade. He was a person who had a community minded outlook right from the word go. He was known by his mates as ‘Larco’. On reading about him we find that he was very much a person whom people could rely on to lift their spirits when they were down—to get them down to the public bar and have a beer with them. For those who were under the pump and struggling with the pressure that the field of engagement can bring on, he was a person who would try to make sure they could tolerate it; yet he was only 21 years old when he was fulfilling that role.</para>
<para>Jamie Larcombe was held in high regard by the people around him because he was seen as a team player, a person who saw himself not as the centre of attention but as a crucial cog in the job that he did. He now becomes one of the 23 in this engagement who have given their lives, made the supreme sacrifice. This nation remains forever more in gratitude and will never forget the sacrifice that he has made and his family will continue to make. We do not presume for one moment that the speeches we give here will arrest their pain but we do hope that they show we are totally focused on the sacrifice they have made and will continue to keep Jamie in our hearts.</para>
<para>In an op-ed piece I wrote last week for the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> I said that, in those passing moments as we walk across the marble foyer once more and look up the street to the War Memorial, we will remember Jamie Larcombe. We will also remember Corporal Atkinson from the same 1st Combat Engineer Regiment based in Darwin, which has had two tragic deaths in such a short period of time. There is purpose to this: it is the defence of our nation; it is seeking out and closing with the enemy. If we do not engage with the enemy there, it is only a matter of time before we will have to engage with the enemy here. We keep Jamie Ronald Larcombe and his family in our thoughts and prayers. God bless them.</para>

<para>—I rise to add the Greens’ support to this condolence motion. We concur with the other speakers and with all senators in sending our condolences to the family, the friends and the colleagues of Sapper Jamie Ronald Larcombe, who died tragically in a foreign land. Sapper Jamie Larcombe died in Afghanistan. He was there serving his country. His body has now been brought home to this nation, which he served so bravely and courageously. Sapper Larcombe was only 21. He was born at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island in my home state of South Australia. He has left behind his family, his parents, his three younger sisters and his partner Rhiannon. Our hearts go out to them. He was doing what he thought he should: he was serving his country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While the Greens do not believe in the deployment of Australian troops to Afghanistan, we totally and unreservedly support our service men and women in the job that they do. We think of them as our ambassadors. We think of them as people who are doing their utmost to serve their country. When we look at the fact that Sapper Jamie Larcombe was the 23rd soldier to tragically die in Afghanistan from this nation, we also have to extend our deepest sympathies and thoughts to all of the families who are grieving now.</para>
<para>There are many more serving our country today and they are true patriots. Our thoughts are with them. We wish them safety and our hearts go out to their families, who are always worrying about how their loved ones, their children, their brothers, their sisters, their husbands, their wives, their girlfriends, their boyfriends or their partners are. On behalf of the Australian Greens I send our commiserations, our greatest respect and our concern for the comfort of all the families, the friends and the fellow unit members of Sapper Jamie Larcombe. We all aspire to a future world where we are rid of violence, war and destruction. It is no way for human affairs to be handled, but in the meantime it is still part of the way in which this world does malfunction. I send our deepest regrets to the family.</para>

<para>—At the outset I would like to offer my deepest condolences to Sapper Jamie Larcombe’s family and friends. While nothing we can say in this place can take away their grief, I hope the knowledge that our thoughts and prayers are with them can offer some small comfort. I further support the condolences for the life of the Afghan interpreter lost in the same incident.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The loss of a child is something no parent should have to endure and in war too many sons and daughters have been taken early from their parents. Sapper Jamie Larcombe came from Kangaroo Island—a wonderful part of Australia with a tremendous tight-knit community of some 4,000 residents. I know that that entire community has deeply felt the loss of Sapper Larcombe and they will offer all the support and love they can to his family. I hope that Sapper Jamie Larcombe’s family and loved ones will be able to draw strength from this support. It is hard for us to comprehend their loss. Many others have already paid tribute to Sapper Larcombe’s dedication to service, community spirit and love for his family, friends and country. I echo their sentiments.</para>

<para class="block">I think that is very telling and powerful from the head of the Army and says something about his compassion for his troops. It is clear that we have lost a remarkable young man and it is truly a tragedy that he has been taken from his family so soon. My deepest sympathies and condolences go out to Sapper Jamie Larcombe’s family and friends and his colleagues in the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. May he and his sacrifice never be forgotten.</para>

<para>—I too support this motion of condolence on the death of Sapper Jamie Larcombe. As we have heard, Sapper Larcombe was killed on 19 February, just one day after his third anniversary of joining the Australian Defence Force. He was serving on his first tour of Afghanistan. We know that Sapper Larcombe’s death is the 23rd operational death in Afghanistan on Operation Slipper. His is the fifth death of a combat engineer in Afghanistan and the second from the Darwin based 1st Combat Engineer Regiment within recent weeks.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Sapper Larcombe was killed while patrolling an area south-east of Patrol Base Wali in the Mirabad Valley of Oruzgan Province. An insurgent group engaged ISAF forces and Sapper Larcombe along with an Afghan interpreter was shot, having disembarked their Bushmaster vehicle. A Medivac helicopter was immediately deployed to rescue the pair, but both had died before returning to Tarin Kot.</para>
<para>Every Australian soldier killed in action in Afghanistan leaves a grieving family, grieving friends and grieving members of the Australian Defence Force. At a time like this our thoughts are with them—the people so terribly affected by the death of their loved one, whom we honour in a condolence motion such as this. Today it is Sapper Larcombe’s family, as well as others who are close to him—his parents, partner, three sisters, his friends and his mates from the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. I can only hope, as other senators have said, that these words and the many others that have been written and spoken about Jamie are of some comfort to them. Finding the appropriate words when such an enormous sacrifice has been made is difficult, but I can say, particularly to those close to Jamie Larcombe, that we in the Senate join with very many other Australians who will always honour him and will never forget his sacrifice.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the remarks and contributions of all senators with respect to Sapper Jamie Larcombe, particularly those of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, and my leader, Senator Abetz. Twenty-one-year-old Sapper Jamie Larcombe was killed in Afghanistan when his patrol was ambushed on Saturday, 19 February. He was part of the Darwin based 1st Combat Engineer Regiment taking part in the Mentoring Task Force, which is helping to train the Afghan National Army. At the time of this engagement as part of Operation Geelong, Mentoring Task Force 2 was undertaking an unpartnered patrol in an area to the south-east of Patrol Base Wali aiming to extend our influence in the Mirabad Valley where we are building a new patrol base. Both Sapper Larcombe and an interpreter were struck by enemy gunfire and, despite the concerted efforts of his mates and colleagues, he was unable to be saved.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The hearts of all Australians go out to Sapper Larcombe’s family—his parents, Tricia and Steven, his younger sisters, Anne-Marie, Emily and April, and his partner, Rhiannon—friends and fellow soldiers on the tragic loss of Jamie. The same regiment, as we have heard, lost Corporal Richard Atkinson in a bomb blast just 17 days earlier. This is a double blow to our combat engineers. It is also a terrible reminder to 22 other families, in particular the Atkinson family with Richard’s funeral just a fortnight ago in Launceston.</para>
<para>We have lost another one of our brave and courageous young soldiers, all of whom have been doing an extremely dangerous job in very trying and hazardous circumstances in a very faraway land. This is a devastating time for Sapper Larcombe’s loved ones and his unit, and I extend my condolences and support to them all. He was a very fine soldier, a dedicated professional, a true and very real Australian hero.</para>

<para>I rise today to express my deep sadness on the passing of a young South Australian man, a Kangaroo Islander—Jamie Larcombe. Sapper Larcombe, a member of the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, lost his life when his patrol was attacked by insurgents in the Mirabad Valley in Afghanistan. That weekend I was on Kangaroo Island among a large gathering of islanders at a community event, when the news came through. The effect on the island’s closely-knit community was immediate—a great sadness descended. One of the island’s own was lost, and in a place far away. Sapper Larcombe was just 21 years old.</para>
<para>Born at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island, Jamie Larcombe attended Parndana Area School where his youngest sister April still attends. He was noted for his involvement in community activities. He had been active in the CFS since his early teenage years and in 2007 helped fight the bushfires that swept across sections of Kangaroo Island. He loved motorbikes and footy. He still played for Western Districts when the opportunity arose, and he was a great Adelaide Crows fan. He won an Australian Defence Force scholarship in year 12.</para>
<para>Despite his youth, Sapper Larcombe had just marked his third anniversary in the Australian Army. He had already been deployed in Indonesia, helping with the recovery following the Padang earthquake in 2009. He was an impressive young man with a great deal to contribute, and a great future ahead. Clearly, he was much loved and cherished by his family, his girlfriend, his friends and his regimental mates.</para>
<para>Sapper Jamie Larcombe was farewelled at a memorial service at Tarin Kowt. When it was over, more than 2,000 soldiers from six nations stood to honour him as his coffin was lifted into an RAAF Hercules. I offer my sincere condolences to Jamie’s parents Tricia and Steven, partner Rhiannon, sisters Anne-Marie, Emily and April, and his Kangaroo Island and Army friends and communities. Vale, Jamie Larcombe.</para>

<para>It is with great sadness that I support this condolence motion. I cannot begin to imagine the profound sorrow of Private Jamie Larcombe’s family—his parents, Tricia and Steven; his sisters Anne-Marie, Emily and April; his partner Rhiannon Penhall; and of course his friends—a football-playing country boy from Parndana on Kangaroo Island will have plenty of them. As a parent myself, my heart breaks for Jamie’s parents. I cannot imagine the heartache of having to farewell a child in this way. In the normal course of things, we parents expect to precede our children.</para>
<para>Jamie Larcombe died in the proud and selfless service of his country. Born in Kingscote, Jamie Larcombe graduated from the Parndana Area School in 2007 and joined the Army soon after his 18th birthday. Those who knew him say he always had his eyes and his heart set on a career in Australia’s Army. Jamie Larcombe was on his first deployment to Afghanistan. He had only been there a short time—since September—that is, around the time he turned 21.</para>
<para>This war in Afghanistan, which has claimed 23 Australian lives, has now hit home in the tight-knit community of Kangaroo Island. Jamie is one of many brave South Australians to have faced the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan since the Australian Defence Force commenced Operation Slipper in 2002. Sergeant Andrew Russell died in 2002. We lost Sapper Darren Smith and Private Tomas Dale last year and, now, Sapper Jamie Larcombe. His passing serves to remind us, yet again, of the reality of what we ask our defence personnel to do in various theatres of conflict around the world. They wear their uniforms in our name and put their lives on the line, in a very real way, ever day.</para>
<para>Mr President, at another time in this place I spoke about Australia’s commitment to the war in Afghanistan. I said in that speech that unmitigated tragedies like the death of Jamie Larcombe are not just headlines in newspapers and radio and television news reports to be forgotten in a day or two. These tragedies are devastatingly real. Jamie Larcombe’s sacrifice is real, enduring and brutally painful—like those sacrifices made by the other personnel who have lost their lives in Afghanistan.</para>
<para>So, at times like this, we would not be human in we did not stop and ask ourselves whether we should stay in this conflict which is half a world away, a conflict that has taken 23 Australian lives and continues to bring so much grief and heartache to brave Australian families. But we stay to mark the courage and honour the sacrifice of Jamie and the other Australians who have died or been injured pursuing peace and security in Afghanistan. We stay to say to Jamie and his family that his was a fight worth having and a peaceful, safe, secure and just world is an objective worth pursuing.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Yesterday, during the censure motion, Senator Bob Brown sought the protection of the chair from interjections. As all senators know, interjections are disorderly. The basis for this is standing order 197(1), which provides that a senator shall not interrupt another senator speaking, except to draw attention to a point of order or privilege or to call attention to the lack of a quorum; otherwise, a senator who has been given the call has the right to speak without interruption.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While interjections are technically contrary to standing order 197, in practice some interjections are tolerated if they are not disruptive or if they facilitate the exchange of views and arguments in a debate. However, the chair will protect from interjections a senator who asks to be protected. This principle has its basis in rulings of Presidents which have the force of standing orders.</para>
<para>When it appeared to Senator Bob Brown that he may not be getting that protection, he did make what can only be characterised as a reflection on the chair. In responding to a single word interjection by Senator Macdonald, Senator Bob Brown said:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That ignorance—which of course you are allowing him to continue to display, Mr Acting Deputy President, because you do not invoke the standing orders of this place, as you should—which is writ large in what he is doing and saying—</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">to which Senator Trood, as the Acting Deputy President, responded:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Senator Brown, order! It ill behoves you to cast aspersions on the chair.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As a reflection on the chair, the words were objectionable and therefore disorderly. Senator Trood was correct to insist on their withdrawal and I note that Senator Brown did withdraw them but only after seriously running the risk of being named for persistently and wilfully disregarding the authority of the chair. It is a basic rule of the Senate that order is maintained by the President or whoever is deputising for the President in the chair. Respect for the chair is fundamental to the effective operation of the Senate, a matter for which all senators carry responsibility.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the statement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Mr President, the statement you have made is, at its core, based on two false premises and does not, therefore, uphold the standing orders of the Senate. Firstly the characterisation of the breach of a standing order as ‘technical’ is wrong in general and in particular. To adopt departure of exception from the standing orders in particular circumstances is to undermine the standing orders and the high responsibility of the chair to defend their integrity.</para>
<para>In the particular case the President contends, incorrectly, that it was acceptable for the chair to allow ‘a single-word interjection by Senator Macdonald’. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record clearly reveals repeated, loud and disruptive interjections from Senator Macdonald, not directed at the chair but at me, from four metres away. He was, moreover, making a deliberate breach of standing order 197, backed by multiple interjections from fellow members of the opposition without the permission of the chair.</para>
<para>There has to be, and is, a distinction between the chair and its occupants. This is clearly entertained in the Senate’s ability to debate the occupant’s failure to uphold the Senate’s interests via a motion of dissent. On a day of major issues, including an opposition motion to censure the government, derailing the Senate’s order of business, I did not move dissent. However, dissent was warranted. The idea that any criticism of the ruling by an occupant of the chair is a reflection on the office of the chair is unsustainable. Its logical outcome is to allocate unrestrained warrant, including derogation of the standing orders, on the basis of tolerating technical infractions to the occupier. I do not accept this dangerous disempowerment of elected senators who have every right to be protected by the upholding, without fear or favour, of the standing orders.</para>
<para>In defence of the Senate, I do not accept your statement.</para>

<para>—Mr President, from time to time, as you would know, we in the coalition question statements made by you. On this occasion we fully endorse and accept your statement. Mr President, I trust we always show good grace in accepting the authority of the chair and the decision of the chair, even when we might not necessarily agree with your determination. The simple fact is, and let us be quite frank here, that Senator Brown is a chief interjector, as indeed many of us are because we feel passionate about issues. That is the way it is in this place. Many a time when I have been called upon to withdraw I have thought, ‘That wasn’t a fair cop.’ Nevertheless, I have withdrawn. Quite frankly, many a time I have interjected or behaved in a manner for which, quite possibly, I should have been called to account but have not been. I think that is the experience of every single senator in his place—</para>

<para>—Apart, of course, from Senator Conroy, who is a paragon of virtue when it comes to the standing orders! More seriously, with great respect to Senator Brown, yesterday was not the finest display of temperament by a party leader who bears, I think, special responsibility to the colleagues who sit behind him or with him to ensure that the chair is fully protected at all times.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Those who occupy the chair do a very difficult job in this place. I have no doubt that they absolutely do their best and, as is the want of every human endeavour, from time to time they will get it wrong. I can say that overwhelmingly they get it right and, as the President has ruled, there is absolutely no doubt that on this occasion Senator Trood was absolutely impeccable in the way he handled it. Quite frankly, I am not sure how many other temporary chairs would have accepted the petulance of the Leader of the Australian Greens for so long without having him removed from the chamber. As indeed you said in your statement, Mr President, Senator Brown seriously ran the risk of being named. All this occurred after a single word interjection by Senator Macdonald. When a name was mentioned, Senator Macdonald said, ‘Who?’ This then led to what can only be described as quite a bizarre diatribe and an attack on the temporary chair.</para>
<para>From time to time, those of us who feel it is getting too rowdy, as we try to make our point, seek protection from the chair. That is a proper and appropriate course of action to take. When it is done, without fail, the chair asks the Senate to quieten down to allow the speaker to continue. If the chair were to interrupt each and every speech on each and every occasion there was a one-word interjection, this place simply could not operate. We all know that. So with great respect to Senator Brown, I would have hoped that he would have used the occasion to apologise for his petulance and to reflect on what he did yesterday, which, I repeat, was not the finest display of temperament by the leader of a party in this place. Indeed, it fell far short of the standard one would expect of a party leader.</para>
<para>Senator Trood, in the face of gross provocation by the Leader of the Australian Greens, handled the situation superbly with his demeanour and his coolness, which saved Senator Brown from being named and thrown out of this place. For Senator Brown, in his contribution this morning, to not be thankful to Senator Trood for his forbearance reflects very badly on the Leader of the Australian Greens. To you, Mr President, I say thank you for reporting back so quickly and confirming the correctness of Senator Trood’s ruling at the time.</para>

<para>—Mr President, I rise to endorse your comments. The government supports the statement that you have made wholeheartedly. We recognise the authority of the chair in this and many other instances. The chair’s role in this place is an important one. This is one of those important times when we require the cooperation of all senators to ensure that the Senate continues in a way that befits its role in a parliamentary democracy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Occasionally we find that people do stray from that narrow path set by the rules. In those instances, the chair and the chair’s authority is integral to ensuring that we return to that path in order to allow us to debate the important matters that are raised in this chamber, to debate the issues before the chair. We then need to use all of our ability to engage in those debates rather than be distracted by extraneous matters or interjections. It is the responsibility of all people in this chamber not to be distracted by the occasional interjection. Of course those interjections are disorderly and of course they should not be made, but I recognise, and I think everyone in this chamber recognises, that on occasions people are driven to making an interjection. It is certainly not a new phenomenon and I am certain that it will continue in future.</para>
<para>However, that does not detract from the fact that it is the chair who is charged with the responsibility of ensuring order in this place. The action that the chair took yesterday was proper and the ruling that you, Mr President, were asked to contemplate and report back on was proper. The government recognises that it was a matter that needed to be reported back on quickly and you have done so. The government appreciates your promptness in bringing it back here.</para>
<para>It is important that everybody in this chamber recognises that the chair plays an extraordinarily important role in maintaining order in this chamber. Where order is departed from, the chair’s role is clear: to bring people back to order so that the debate can continue. Sometimes it is necessary for people to recognise, even if they think they have been hard done by—I think everyone in this chamber sometimes thinks that, through a ruling of the chair, they have been hard done by—that the proper functioning of this chamber requires that, when that happens, they accept the chair’s ruling and move on to the important debates of this chamber.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R4508">Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011</inline> and the <inline ref="R4507">Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011</inline>. These bills are important to Queenslanders, but not only to Queenslanders. They are important across all the regions of Australia to which I have travelled recently, all those regions affected by the extraordinary circumstances that have descended upon us—Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, the top end of South Australia and across to the Gascoyne in Western Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In contradistinction to that, the recent political tactics from the opposition on this bill are all too familiar—that is, to oppose, to block and to stop anything the government decides to do that is clearly in the national interest. Rebuilding Queensland is in the national interest, keeping the economy strong is in the national interest and paying as we go while doing the rebuilding is in the national interest. It is easier for Mr Abbott to try and scare Australians than to try and lead. It is easier to exaggerate an issue than use reason and common sense in the debate.</para>
<para>What we are seeing in the Senate in this debate is yet another example of how this opposition leader’s negativity, his complete hollowness as a politician, is permeating through his own parliamentary rabble. It must be difficult for some in the opposition to drag themselves in here each morning knowing that they have nothing constructive or forward thinking to say on this bill or on many of the other matters that are brought here. There is a lot of hyperbole and misrepresentation in this place from those opposite. There has also been, quite frankly, a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the reconstruction effort required and a lack of goodwill towards the people of Queensland and those other parts of Australia where that reconstruction is needed.</para>
<para>We have heard from those opposite about tax grabs and a tax on volunteers. We have heard those opposite attack the member for O’Connor, Mr Crook, for supporting the government’s position. We have heard much from those opposite about the impacts these disasters have had on communities right across Australia and their very significant impacts on Queensland. We have not heard from them how we have to get on with the job of rebuilding disaster affected communities, how we have to rebuild our roads and bridges, and how we need to support our businesses and farmers.</para>
<para>I think it might be appropriate to remind the Senate why this bill is so important. I will focus briefly on my home state of Queensland as an example. The estimated impact of the Queensland floods on Australia has been put at $30 billion not including Yasi. Three-quarters of Queensland has been declared a disaster area. Sixty-seven local government areas have been designated for disaster assistance under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. These areas cover a population of over four million people.</para>
<para>This government is supporting the rebuilding of Queensland, and it is tough work. It involves tough decisions and the government will see the job through. Yesterday was the last day of summer, a summer many of us are glad to see the back of. It has been a dreadful season of natural disasters. I support this levy because I have seen first-hand the devastation of these disaster events and understand the scale of the work that is required. What is clear is that the Commonwealth government must play a leading role in the reconstruction of Queensland and must do so in an economically responsible way.</para>
<para>I have seen floods across the east coast through Toowoomba, floods through Brisbane and a cyclone that ripped across our north. Emerald is a town that I have seen in many states—in the peak of the drought and more recently at the height of the floods. Visiting Emerald on 4 January and again less than 10 days later, I noted the impact of the floods was, in a word, unbelievable. The swiftness of the waters and the impact they had on the countryside, on the railways and on the retail area of Emerald were devastating. The Rocklea markets in Brisbane under water was one of the more frequent images on our television screens during the flooding throughout the Brisbane CBD and surrounding suburbs. At that site entire forklifts were thrown across the markets as the floods ravaged Rocklea and moved through all that area. A challenge that confronted the markets was simply finding and identifying the hardware that was strewn across the side. I was particularly pleased to be able to see the Rocklea markets back in operation a few days later. The spirit was still there to get the markets up and running as soon as possible. When I visited they had just completed their first day of limited trading and many distributors were still cleaning and hosing out sheds, recovering lost property and preparing access routes for the morning’s trucks.</para>
<para>In Dalby I met with the Mayor of the Western Downs Regional Council, Ray Brown, who talked to me about the issues that were confronting his community and the challenges ahead for flood recovery and reconstruction in that region. I had an opportunity to talk to many other mayors, and I will not name them all, across Gatton, Helidon and Grantham and to speak to local residents as well as community groups and organisations in those areas. Amongst the tears that people had, amongst the disappointment that they had having lost loved ones, amongst the disappointment and sadness of their having lost possessions and had houses flooded—or destroyed by Cyclone Yasi—the resilience of the community shone through. In Ipswich I witnessed reactions and emotions familiar to those of many other parts of Queensland as people were slowly, carefully, cleaning up, starting the rebuilding effort, commencing the work that would see them try to bring their life back to some sense of order. I was pleased also to spend Australia Day with communities in and around Toowoomba, including the people of Oakey, Chinchilla and Miles, as they celebrated what they had: their friendship and bond of comradeship in regional and rural communities—each other, in fact. As if this summer of floods was not enough, which I have mentioned, the impact of Cyclone Yasi left a tremendous mark on Far North Queensland. Having visited that region, I saw the devastation across Cardwell, Tully and Innisfail—hit hard by cyclones twice in five years. In these towns people were displaced, main streets impacted and agricultural sheds and crops destroyed. These people, as well as most of my state, require a recovery effort, a rebuilding effort, that is on a scale that we have not seen before in this country.</para>
<para>I detail these visits across Queensland because, as I met with regional councils impacted by floods and cyclones and facing the challenge of their recovery, the government was assessing the role that it could play and the way in which it could support the communities and towns across Queensland. The Gillard government has been clear that its role is to support communities, get them back on their feet and back into work and so recover from the natural disasters. It has involved tough decisions and these were taken by the Prime Minister to tackle head on the challenges of supporting the reconstruction effort. The government has made clear that the responsible course of action is for the government to be directly involved in supporting the rebuilding of Queensland. The scale of this disaster means we have taken difficult decisions to find the necessary funds to rebuild the roads, bridges, ports and community infrastructure that have been damaged by the floods. As part of the $5.6 billion recovery package announced by the Prime Minister, the government will institute a modest one-off levy. For every dollar raised by the levy to fund reconstruction efforts, the Commonwealth will raise $2 through spending cuts.</para>
<para>I turn the attention of the Senate to the nature of this levy and put this policy in context, given what I can only describe as a wall of hysteria that I heard from the coalition opposition yesterday. As I have said, the levy is temporary and modest. Only 46 per cent of taxpayers will pay the levy and 60 per cent of taxpayers will pay less than $1 a week. Further, low-income earners and individuals who have received the Australian government disaster recovery payment will be exempt from the levy. As a progressive levy, it is based on the ability of an individual to pay. Anyone earning under $50,000 will not pay the levy, people earning between $50,000 and $100,000 will pay 0.5 per cent of taxable income in excess of $50,000, people earning over $100,000 will pay 0.5 per cent of taxable income in excess of $50,000 and one per cent of taxable income in excess of $100,000.</para>
<para>The levy will go towards supporting the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to rebuild vital bridges, roads, ports and railways. It is a good and appropriate means of raising the necessary funds to rebuild Queensland. The government has found $2 of savings for every $1 raised by the levy. These were tough cuts to respond to an unprecedented natural disaster. The Commonwealth has identified $2.8 billion in spending cuts to help pay for the flood recovery measure. These will be through abolishing, deferring and capping access to a number of carbon abatement programs. Also, funding under the Building Better Regional Cities and Priority Infrastructure programs will be redirected to flood rebuilding. In order to both manage the capacity of the economy and help the immediate rebuilding efforts, the government will defer some infrastructure projects, saving $1.8 billion.</para>
<para>I also take the opportunity to assist the Senate with what has already been rolled out into these communities or activated by the Commonwealth and jointly with the state government. In response to the natural disasters, the Commonwealth was quick to roll out emergency financial assistance measures to assist in recovery efforts. These included, as I mentioned earlier, the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, the Australian government disaster recovery payment and the disaster income subsidy. As at 24 February, approximately 649,531 AGDRP payments had been made across Australia, totalling $754 million. Of these, 376,172 payments worth $442 million related to the Queensland floods. As of 24 February, approximately 56,862 DIRS—which is the income subsidy—had been paid across Australia, totalling $25.3 million. Of these, 50,408 payments worth about $22 million relate to the Queensland floods. A range of cost shared NDRRA relief and recovery systems measures continue to be made available through the Queensland government, including matters such as personal hardship and distress relief assistance such as emergency food, accommodation, clothing and replacement of essential household items; psychological and financial counselling; public infrastructure restoration; concessional loans to small businesses, primary producers, voluntary not-for-profit bodies and needy individuals; and grants of up to $25,000 for small businesses and primary producers.</para>
<para>Further, for the impact of tropical Cyclone Yasi the government has announced a support package and wage subsidy. The government has worked with the Queensland government and the local community on a package that recognises the special characteristics of the region hit by the cyclone. The package, which is in addition to the standard NDRRA assistance, was announced on 16 February and extended on 25 February. It includes measures such as concessional interest rate loans and grants of up to $650,000 with a capped up to $50,000 non-repayable grant for eligible businesses, primary producers and voluntary not-for-profit bodies; a rural resilience fund; and a package of up to $20 million jointly funded by the Australian and the Queensland governments to provide support for a range of community and social support measures for community businesses and primary producers. A wage subsidy has also been made available through the Australian government to employers whose businesses have been directly affected by tropical Cyclone Yasi and who are unable to pay full wages to employees during the recovery phase. Wage assistance will be paid to employers for eligible employees for 13 weeks in total.</para>
<para>A package targeted at supporting local councils impacted by Queensland’s floods has also been announced by the Commonwealth and state governments. The Queensland local council package is a $315 million package to help Queensland local councils repair utilities and infrastructure and support their efforts in recovering from both the floods and Cyclone Yasi. There is $265 million to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to fast-track the repair of damaged infrastructure across Queensland. This is to repair severely damaged water and sewerage infrastructure owned by local government. It will be prioritised and will also provide up to $145 million to fast-track reconstruction of the Brisbane ferry terminals and the Brisbane River wharf. An upfront payment of $50 million will be made available to help regional and remote councils employ people to perform important clean-up and repair work, with the option to provide further funding for employment if required. Commonwealth funding for the package is $206 million and the contribution from the Queensland government will be $109 million.</para>
<para>Madam Acting Deputy President, what I have outlined to you and the Senate is the scale of not only the beginning of the devastation, the resilience of the community and their ability to engage and start the recovery effort but also their need for government assistance to ensure that recovery continues and that we do see the end where people can have a community—I guess in some respects it will never be the same—restored to a position where they can enjoy the amenities of their local cities and country towns. Of course, the scale of the destruction only really serves to put in context the scale of the reconstruction and recovery effort that now stands before Queensland.</para>
<para>I have made clear in this contribution that the levy is both modest and temporary. It is targeted and scaled to impact those who can pay. I have also taken the opportunity of explaining that the work and support the Commonwealth and state government have made available is flowing across the state already. It is much needed. This levy supports the rebuilding of Queensland infrastructure to get the communities and the state up and running again. This levy, as the Prime Minister has said, is about the Commonwealth standing together with Queensland and supporting it in its task ahead. I commend the bills to the Senate.</para>

<para>I take issue with my friend and colleague Senator Ludwig. He said that government assistance was required. Yes, I agree with that aspect of his contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R4508">Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011</inline> and related bill. I vehemently disagree with him that it has to be done by way of a tax. In the last 48 hours we have seen a relationship between the Prime Minister and Senator Bob Brown, which is now to be known as the Gillard-Brown government. Indeed, it is a partnership which has been conceived on earth but which will be delivering from hell. I cannot imagine a more dangerous group to be running this country than Ms Gillard and, effectively, her de facto, fellow Prime Minister Bob Brown—a very dangerous outcome.</para>
<para>I want to talk about the ramifications of this levy and, indeed, the ramifications of the government’s carbon tax, which was announced a couple of days ago. But, firstly, I want to refer to those who have actually been concerned about the government’s levy. I note with some interest that on 29 January, under the headline ‘ALP’s flood tax revolt’, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> said, ‘Furious, unnamed Labor MPs could not wait to tell the national correspondent Steve Lewis that they were opposed to this.’ One of them even said it was one of the ‘dumbest decisions’ made by the Prime Minister—</para>

<para>—It is indeed—and a decision that left senior Labor figures shaking their heads at the lack of cabinet consultation. Of course, there was no cabinet consultation in relation to this matter. We now know full well that there was no cabinet consultation in relation to the carbon tax. So Labor got rid of one Prime Minister because he refused to engage cabinet or the backbench and they have now replaced Kevin Rudd with another Prime Minister, who also refuses to consult. So what was it all about? The micromanager Kevin Rudd has been replaced by the micromanager Julia Gillard. I suppose the big difference between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard is that he did not form this unholy alliance with Senator Bob Brown and the other Greens. That is the big difference between Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd.</para>

<para>—And do you know, Senator Polley, it is a tax that you can run from but most certainly cannot hide from. Those opposite have imposed another tax on the Australian people and they did not spend one nanosecond looking at other options. Senator Ludwig, as I said, was right: everyone in Queensland, Victoria and elsewhere who suffered from these floods needs government assistance. What they do not need is another tax. The interesting part about this, in my view, is that I think the Australian Labor Party—not you, Madam Acting Deputy President—in one fell swoop has sent a very dangerous message to the Australian people. There is anecdotal evidence, which I believe is correct from feedback that I have had, of the damage done by going to the Australian people and pleading for them to support the flood victims—which they did and which they have always been happy to do, as they did in Victoria two years ago—and then imposing a tax on top of that. You have destroyed the giving nature in this country. This will be the legacy: you will have single-handedly, potentially destroyed the giving culture in this country and you will pay an enormous penalty for that stupidity.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The coalition’s response to this matter was the appropriate response. On the back of the need for the Australian community and the Australian taxpayer to support the people of Queensland and elsewhere with financial assistance, we actually went down an entirely different path to that of the Australian Labor Party. We looked at where there may be savings to be made, where there may be government waste that could be set aside and put towards the flood victims. The Australian Labor Party just lives on taxes. If it is a problem, you tax it. We have said, quite clearly, that there are other options in relation to finding the money, the government assistance, that should be provided.</para>
<para>I will go very quickly through the list again. We would partially defer water buybacks in the Murray-Darling Basin and delay funding under the so-called Building the Education Revolution program. We have seen more money wasted on this program than I think we have ever seen in this country’s history. You will waste that amount of money on the Green Loans and the Home Insulation programs but you will not give $5 million to our national icon down the road—the Australian War Memorial. I ask: what are your priorities? We would redirect the remaining funds from the Building Better Regional Cities program. We would reduce spending on the Automotive Transformation Scheme. There would be further cuts in funding to the GP Super Clinics Program—another farce. We would defer funding from the Australia Indonesia Education Partnership and discontinue funding to the National Solar Schools program and others. We sat down and looked at where the savings might be, because we acknowledge that the communities who suffered from the floods deserve this country and the government to put in for their reconstruction—but not by way of a tax.</para>
<para>When you look around this country, you will see whether there is fire or flood that the one thing that brings people together—the people in my state of Victoria, the people in New South Wales, Queensland and throughout the country, particularly country people—is their ability to respond quickly to changed circumstances, and especially when those changed circumstances relate to their neighbour or the person living down the road from them. What Australians are very quick to do in these times of trouble is to change their priorities. They will change their priorities in a nanosecond, and those priorities will be changed to ensure that they provide assistance to their neighbour in the widest possible sense. It begs the question: if people in that situation can change their priorities quickly, why is it impossible for the Gillard-Brown government to change its priorities? Why didn’t they do what that magnificent army of volunteers around this country did when they changed their priorities overnight to address the situation they were confronted with and respond accordingly? When you look at those who have been involved in these events, such as the SES, the farmers, the people in the towns and the cities—the sand baggers; those who dropped everything to help—you see that they changed their priorities and went to help their neighbour. The Australian community is quite capable of changing its priorities. It is extraordinary to me that this government is unable to do likewise.</para>
<para>I want to talk about the latest product of the Gillard-Brown government—the big new tax that is going to be delivered. My fear is that, when push comes to shove downstairs, the Independents will be so scared of taking on this government that they will roll over again. And when legislation comes back up here, the other part of the Gillard government will ensure that this country has a carbon tax.</para>

<para>—I know, I know. I am sorry, and I regret saying it now. I want to go through the ramifications of this new tax. The ramifications of this new tax on Australian families are quite dramatic, and I defy anyone in this chamber to stand up and say that Australian families are not under cost-of-living pressure. Everyone in this country knows that Australian families are under cost-of-living pressure. It is tough out there for families and it is incredibly tough out there for small business. I do not expect those opposite to know anything about the way of small businesses, because they pride themselves on getting involved in big business and then they reduce them to small business. They have no credibility at all in relation to small business in this country.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Small business is doing it tough, Australian families are doing it tough, and there should not be one person in this chamber who does not know how much electricity and other services have gone up in the last two years. They have gone up quite dramatically—and compared with a lot of people in this country we are well remunerated. I will just go through the figures. I think some 6.5 cents per litre is predicted to go on top of petrol prices if this goes through. If you are living in inner Sydney or inner Melbourne, the constituency of the Deputy Prime Minister—or is he the Prime Minister down the other end here—you do not know the impact of increased petrol prices. Get into the country and you will see what the impact of petrol prices is. Get into the country and see the families who have to drive their kids to two or three schools every morning and come back every afternoon. You go and speak to them about what impact petrol prices have on their families. Go and speak to those people who have lost all their crops in the last month and see how they will be doing it over the next 12 months, whether they can afford increased electricity, gas and petrol prices. The clear fact is that they cannot do so, and why we would be ahead of the pack in relation to this is beyond me. I am reminded that we emit just 1.28 per cent of global emissions; China, 22.3; the USA, 19.91; and the EU, 14.04. And we are leading the pack!</para>
<para>The outcome of this will be that you will be exporting nothing except our emissions. The Australian Labor Party will ensure that we are exporting nothing but our emissions, because that is what will happen. For all its sins, this country is a relatively clean emitter, but we are going to take our industry, particularly our manufacturing industry, away from this country and put it overseas in countries where they do not have the same controls that we have. That, to me, is a nonsensical outcome.</para>
<para>I have spoken to my colleague on my left, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, about the impact on the Illawarra, for example, and the jobs that we have lost in the Illawarra. That will take place all over the country. If you are looking at Victoria, look at the impact on a company like Alcoa, which is a very big employer in Victoria, and there will be plenty of others in a similar position.</para>
<para>I will finish where I started. I express my sincere condolences to those who have suffered so badly during these floods. I plead with the Australian Labor Party not to proceed with this tax and most certainly not to proceed with a new carbon tax.</para>

<para>—If Senator Ronaldson cannot run an argument for 20 minutes about the flood levy, I do not think there is much value in his arguments at all. I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R4507">Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011</inline>. We all know that Australia has been hit very hard by natural disasters this past summer, with floods occurring across the nation. We have also faced bushfires and a category 5 cyclone, as well as other storms.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Queensland was hit particularly hard by the floods and by Cyclone Yasi. As a result of these terrible floods and cyclones in Queensland, much rebuilding needs to be done. We know that people lost their homes and their businesses, and vital community infrastructure was damaged or destroyed. We all know that rebuilding will take a long time and will be costly. It will require local communities and all levels of government to work together. Just as Australians support each other in times of natural disasters, we need to be there for each other in the rebuilding phase that follows. The Gillard government are committed to rebuilding after this destruction and we are also committed to sound economic management, and that means that some tough decisions have to be made. As is always the case following a disaster or tragedy, Australians have been generous in helping those who are suffering. The money donated by people across the country following the recent disasters has been most welcome and will help provide relief to those affected. This money will help people who have lost possessions or, worse still, their homes or livelihoods. These people will certainly appreciate that financial support and the generosity that it conveys.</para>
<para>However, as generous as Australians are, these contributions alone are not enough to rebuild all that has been lost. The Australian government will foot the largest share of the bill, as we should. We will not shirk our responsibilities and we will not avoid the challenges presented by these disasters. We will face them head on. We need to rebuild and we need to do it as quickly as possible. We need to prioritise the rebuilding so that the most crucial facilities and infrastructure are rebuilt first.</para>
<para>The Australian government estimates that the contribution needed from federal funds is a minimum of $5.6 billion. That is a massive amount of money, as we all know. In fact it is about 30 times the amount that has been contributed to the Premier’s relief fund. As everyone would appreciate, we need to find this money in addition to continuing to fund our regular programs and services; we cannot simply put everything on hold until the rebuilding is complete. The $5.6 billion does not even include the damages from Cyclone Yasi. The government has assessed the damage from the floods and has decided that the best approach to meeting the cost of reconstruction is to find the money in two ways. Some of the money, two-thirds of it in fact, will come from budget savings. Spending in some areas will be cut or deferred, which, unfortunately, is necessary to meet the costs of the floods. However, in order that more services do not have to be cut or deferred, the government is asking taxpayers to contribute by paying a one-off levy.</para>
<para>For those on the other side, who really do not seem to understand, it is a one-off levy; it is only for a year. The government is not prepared to delay a return to surplus. We said that we would return to surplus by 2012-13 and we will meet that promise. Good economic management dictates that it is sensible not to add pressure to areas that are already stretched. Despite the damage inflicted by the floods and Cyclone Yasi, Australia’s economy will be back at capacity in 2011-12. Australia has $380 billion in mining projects in the pipeline, we have a skills shortage on the horizon and our wages are at healthy levels. These are pressures that are likely to be even more pronounced as we enter 2012-13, our projected year of return to surplus. The government has taken a well-informed decision. It is a sensible economic goal.</para>
<para>The government firmly believes in a balanced approach to meeting the costs of the floods, which is why we have chosen to cut some spending programs, to defer some infrastructure and to impose a modest temporary levy. As I said—and I will keep saying it because those on the other side really do not seem to understand it—the levy the government is introducing is a one-off levy which will apply only to people on incomes of more than $50,000 a year. The spending cuts and deferrals combined will raise $3.8 billion, and the proposed levy will raise $1.8 billion. Despite the levy being modest and sensible, those opposite, in their usual fashion, have decided to oppose it. Before we had the theatrics of Senator Ronaldson yelling, getting very vocal and very loud, as though raising his voice will make a difference to what the people of Australia really want—and the people of Australia are quite supportive of this levy. But those on the other side go around scaremongering, trying to frighten people, giving misinformation, using the ‘tax’ word when they know it is a levy. We all know that the opposition love to oppose for opposition’s sake, and once again this is what they are doing. We had hoped that they might see that the levy is necessary for the rebuilding process, but they have failed to do that.</para>
<para>The Australian people have every right to ask tough questions of the government in order that they understand our decisions. Unlike those opposite, most Australians understand that the levy is an important part of the rebuilding. They understand that budget savings plus some moderate contribution from Australian taxpayers is a fair and balanced approach to raising the needed funds. In opposing this levy the opposition have conveniently forgotten their history of imposing levies. They imposed six different levies during their 12 years in government. If raising a levy is, as they claim, a sign of incompetent budget management, then what does that say about the government they ran? They also tried to impose other levies, unsuccessfully. In fact, since being in opposition Tony Abbott has proposed a levy to fund his paid parental leave scheme. They accuse us of being the party of high taxes, yet while we were trying to cut company tax they were trying to raise it. Abbott’s proposed levy was a tax on families at the checkouts at Coles and Woolies to help pay the wages of women taking maternity leave—women who are already earning $150,000 a year.</para>
<para>Tony Abbott has had several different positions on flood recovery. He embarrassed himself by saying that the National Broadband Network could be scrapped to pay for flood reconstruction. He forgot to account for the fact that the NBN is not just an expense; it is an investment with a commercial return. Then, in early February, he made the statement that there were $8 billion in funds, including in the Building Australia Fund, that were uncommitted. Later he had to revise that down to $2 billion. Both statements are incorrect, and it is a shame that Mr Abbott would attempt to mislead the Australian people to make political gain over such a sensitive issue. Tony Abbott finally settled on the coalition’s current policy when he announced that the coalition would propose further budget savings as an alternative to the $1.8 billion raised by the levy. But how could we possibly trust the opposition to make savings? How can we trust Tony Abbott on his promise when he had a $10.6 billion black hole in his 2010 election costings? Of course it took them two weeks after Mr Abbott made that statement to actually come up with their proposals—two weeks, while he had a fight with his deputy and shadow cabinet over what savings to make. That is what the delay was all about: Liberal infighting. It seems that Mr Abbott’s attempts to make political mileage out of this tragedy know no bounds. After all, while Australians were digging deep to help with the flood recovery, Mr Abbott was soliciting political donations to help fight the flood levy.</para>
<para>We know that no-one likes to pay extra taxes; we absolutely know that. However, we also know that most Australian people are happy to pay a modest contribution—the word is ‘modest’—under extraordinary circumstances like those we now face. The Gillard government has received a number of high-profile endorsements for our proposed levy. For example, Colin Barnett, the Premier of Western Australia, has put aside political differences to support the levy.</para>

<para>—I can confirm that, as I indicated in the primary answer to Senator Cormann, decisions in relation to the Gillard Labor government’s position are determined in accordance with normal government processes, and that includes cabinet processes. I do not intend to take the senator through those decision-making processes in detail other than to say he is wrong in his assertion. This illustrates the fact that the opposition have nothing to say about policy. They want to discuss the government’s processes and the role of the Greens—petty political point-scoring—but have nothing to say about the big issue of the challenge of climate change. They have nothing to say about it at all. This government is committed to working with those of goodwill and an interest in public policy in this parliament to get a good result for Australia. That is what we are seeking to do. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This again confirms that the opposition are bereft of ideas and bereft of any contribution to public policy. They are concentrated on their own internal divisions trying to prop up Mr Abbott’s leadership, under attack from the moderates on issues as broad as multiculturalism, immigration, foreign aid and now climate change. This government actually thinks climate change is a problem that needs to be tackled. We have consistently argued that we need a constructive response to the challenge of climate change and pollution in our environment. We have sought in successive parliaments to get a solution that allows us to bring in a price on carbon and allows us to tackle this great challenge. I would expect that the opposition actually try to engage in that real public policy challenge. Unfortunately, they refuse to. They look inward and are only interested in opposing. I think that other members of the parliament will obviously have to take the lead. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Hurley for that question—a question that recognises that this is an economic reform. Pricing carbon is a major economic reform that will transform our economy and it is a major economic reform that those opposite are simply not up to. It is a reform that will transform our economy, and because it is an economic reform we know on this side of the chamber that we have to provide certainty to business so they make the investment decisions which are necessary for the transformation of the economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The opposition appears to have forgotten that business investment decisions are not only made for one year but made for many years. Businesses need to be thinking not just about the next year but about the next five years or the next 10 years. Certainty around a price on carbon means that businesses are better able to plan and prepare for these future decisions. Certainty around a price on carbon is fundamental to the better planning and preparation for these future decisions.</para>
<para>We are at a time in this country and in this parliament where we face a choice: do we want to shape the future or do we simply want to have the future imposed upon us? On this side of the chamber, we have Labor senators who are prepared to look to the future, prepared to reform for the future—a party that is prepared to build today for tomorrow. What we are faced with is nothing but a party of wreckers, led by a man who knows how to brawl, a man who knows how to destroy but a man incapable of leadership at this time, a man incapable of leadership in the face of this challenge. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank the senator for her question. It goes to the issue of the extent to which the risk of uncertainty causes flow-on effects throughout the economy. It is interesting, isn’t it, to note that the party opposite used to be a party which believed in market mechanisms, used to be a party that understood the importance of utilising market mechanisms? Now it is a party that does not understand the importance of business certainty and is prepared to rip that away with its irresponsible pledge, delivered yesterday by the chief wrecker, Mr Abbott, to remove the price on carbon if it is ever to return to this side of the chamber. It is a party that used to understand the importance of business certainty and the importance of market mechanisms, now simply looking to its short-term political advantage. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Really, there are no real alternatives on that side. The only alternative is more risk, more uncertainty, more blocking. They are good at wrecking action on climate change. They are good at saying no to reform, but they do not know how to reform. They do not know how to build. Perhaps they ought to take some heed of what Mr Turnbull has said in recent times and is on the record as saying: first, that their policy to deliver a five per cent reduction is ‘a recipe for fiscal recklessness’. Senator Bernardi ought to take note of Mr Turnbull saying he is supporting a policy that is a recipe for fiscal recklessness. But we also have recent revelations in the media that suggest Mr Abbott was even prepared to hint he would have supported a carbon price if that had meant he could form government after the last election. What an indication of the political opportunism of those opposite. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

Minister, I refer to the Prime Minister’s announcement last Thursday that because of ‘changed circumstances’ she was breaking her commitment made on 16 August 2010 that ‘there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead’. Can the minister inform the Senate exactly what the changed circumstances are to excuse the abandonment of the Prime Minister’s solemn promise to the Australian people? Could the minister indicate which countries have been inundated by rising sea levels since last August or which animal species have become extinct since last August?

<para>—One of those questions in that series of questions really said it all, didn’t it? Fundamentally, there is a cabal of those opposite that simply do not accept the science. They hold extreme views—views that might be common on a One Nation website but are not common among the scientists who are experts in this field. Fundamentally, every question that some of the people in this chamber are asking about this issue—and the good senator who asked the question is one of them—proceeds on the basis that they do not accept the science. We do not agree. We do believe that the consensus science is very clear. It is extraordinary that those opposite, who pretend to know something about risk, would seriously say to the Australian people, ‘Yes, we know that there are all these world renowned scientists who tell us about the risk that climate change poses not just for today but for the next generation, for Australians beyond today’—all of the scientific evidence—yet still say we do not have to do anything. ‘We do not have to do anything; we think our political advantage is in running a scaremongering campaign, a fearmongering campaign, and closing our eyes to this challenge.’ You believe that that is the responsible thing to do. We on this side of the chamber do not share that view. We believe that climate change is real, that human beings are contributing to it and that we in this nation have a responsibility to act, not just because of today but because of tomorrow and what it means to future generations of Australians. This is a tough reform. We know this is a tough reform. So was tariff reform, but Labor did that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Pratt for her question. The recently published Pew Charitable Trusts report of last year highlighted that in the period between 2005 and 2009 clean energy investments throughout the G20 increased by 230 per cent. What it also highlighted was that Australia was falling behind its G20 counterparts and that present calculations indicate that Australia ranks 14th out of the 20 countries.

They do know the truth that the Leader of the Opposition, in making any suggestions that you can undertake significant change like this without cost, is not telling the truth. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—What the government has determined is that it is absolutely critical to the future wellbeing of the Australian people that we are able to transform this economy to meet the enormous challenges of climate change. To do so we are prepared to work closely with the business community, and it is very important that we work with the community at large. That is why we have established the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change and that is why we have established the non-government organisations committee—to ensure that an appropriate policy framework is in place to protect the future for this country.</para>

<para>Those opposite are seeking to turn their backs on the future. They want to engage in the slur and innuendo of a program which, essentially, is equipping them to face up to the problems of the 1960s. We have now got to deal with a situation in the 21st century. Those opposite have failed to recognise their responsibilities to the future of this country and to the people of this country to ensure that we are able to protect the living standards of the Australian people.</para>
<para>Pretending that these things will just go away is not an answer. Pretending that we do not have to act on these issues is not an answer. We are in the business of ensuring that we get the investment in place to transform this economy to deal with the challenges of a low-carbon economy. The policies that are being pursued by this government are absolutely in keeping with ensuring that jobs for the future are protected and that economic opportunities for Australians are advanced. Pretending that these problems will go away is a terrible mistake. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>There is an ongoing public debate about what the level of assistance should be to ensure that manufacturing can make the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy. He is entitled to put that view; there will others who will put different views. At the end of the day, this is a proper debate that this country should have.

We are conscious of the range of difficult policy decisions, including the ones Senator Birmingham references, that will have to be made, which is why the government are working sensibly and methodically through the multiparty committee to deal with a whole range of issues. They include coverage, they include the price level and they include what sort of assistance should be provided and how that transition should occur, and we will continue to do that work.</para>

<para>—I think Senator Birmingham’s question is in fact a re-run of the first or the second question, which I responded to. Again I say: these are part of the range of complex decisions that have to be made to put this reform in place. We will work through those issues with industry, with other stakeholders and, through the multiparty committee, with other members of this parliament. But, because it is in the national interest to do so, we will do so. It is regrettable that we are faced not with constructive dialogue with the opposition, or engagement, but with the sort of fearmongering that is implicit, or explicit, in your question and an opposition which simply is looking to what it believes is short-term political interest, not the long-term interests of the nation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—We all hope on this side of the chamber that one day those on the opposite side of the chamber will join us in the 21st century, when you do not laugh at the mention of teleworking, because teleworking can assist Australia to tackle climate change through decreased fuel consumption, decreased congestion in our cities and infrastructure savings. Access Economics estimates that a 10 per cent increase in Australian employees that telework just 50 per cent of the time would save over 120 million litres of fuels and 320,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.</para>

<para>—The Gillard government has deployed a national telepresence system, with at least two facilities operating in each capital city. Usage of the system commenced in October 2009 and full interjurisdictional capability was achieved in July 2010. At the end of January 2011, 344 meetings had taken place, using the system for a total of 580 hours. Usage has been increasing steadily since it was first commissioned. Savings to date from not using airlines, taxis and hotels and from less lost productivity are $3.009 million. The use of telepresence has resulted in approximately 490 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents not being attributed to the Australian government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

He refused to acknowledge the preamble—all of the sledging that went on in the first part of the question—and just airbrushed it away: it did not happen.

<para>—On both sides: I was certainly not helped at the start of the question by the preamble to the question, but then I was certainly not helped by some of the noise that followed in the response. It makes it very difficult up here to hear some of the responses that are coming forth. The minister has, as you rightly pointed out, one minute 26 seconds. I do not set aside part of the time that is allowed for the answer, that being two minutes, for preamble or prologue; I have never said that. I have never stated that from the chair as such. The standing orders dictate that there is a two-minute time limit in which to answer the question. The minister, though, has the responsibility in answering the question to respond in accordance with the standing orders and to be directly relevant to the question that has been asked. I acknowledge that, but I do not accept that there has been a time set aside for prologue or preamble.</para>

<para>I do listen carefully to what the ministers are saying. Sometimes the ministers’ responses are drowned out by calling from both sides of the chamber—and I am not picking on one side or the other there—and it makes it very difficult to pick up the full answer that is being given. On this occasion, I draw the minister’s attention to the fact that there is still one minute 26 seconds remaining in which to answer the question. It would assist the chair if, when people are asking questions, the banter that goes on is ceased. I do understand that people want to let off a bit of steam from time to time and I am fairly tolerant about that. Minister, you have one minute and 26 seconds remaining to answer the question.</para>

<para>—What we know is that the Liberal Party are running around with different scare campaigns—one day I think Mr Hunt was saying it is $1,000, then $500, now it is $300. Quite frankly, no determination has been made about the price to be put on carbon—nor, therefore, the ramifications that flow from that. What we have made clear is that any revenue raised by this government in applying the carbon tax will be used to try and offset the impact on households and businesses, to mitigate the impact on them. That is the approach we took when we tried to introduce the CPRS. It is a consistent approach in trying to ensure equity for Australian families while we try and drive a fundamental change in the Australian economy. It is a fundamental change. It is a major reform. It is serious. It is difficult. But it is worth doing.</para>

<para>—It is a question of whether you are interested in petty point-scoring, which may well go down well in Liberal Party council meetings. It is a reflection again that you fail to seriously engage with the big public policy question facing us. These are serious issues. They are difficult issues. They are issues the Liberal Party chose to engage with in the last parliament, before the reactionary forces got the numbers and forced Malcolm Turnbull out—and, as a result, you walked away. But now you have walked away completely from being serious players in the major challenges confronting this economy and our climate—and, quite frankly, it does you no credit.

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (Senator Evans), the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today, and by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Bishop today, relating to a proposed carbon tax and to the National Broadband Network.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The government claim that our opposition to this tax is creating uncertainty for the business community, but in fact it is the government’s approach that is creating uncertainty. Don’t blame the coalition for the current uncertainty in the business community; have a look at yourselves. This situation has been created by the government, because they do not have a policy—all they have is an announcement. They have come out and said they are going to have a carbon tax, and they are going to work it out, but it is going to be starting from 2012. That is what promotes concern from the industry sector. It is exacerbated by their relationship with the Greens and it is compounded by their broken promises. So don’t start blaming the opposition for the uncertainty that exists, particularly by government actions.</para>
<para>I asked Senator Carr today what modelling his department had done in relation to jobs. At least he did provide the fact that they had done no modelling—they had done none. He said to the chamber that he relied on others to do that modelling. But we know that there has been no modelling done on the impact on jobs of a carbon tax, or even the defunct CPRS, because the impact on jobs was an assumption, an input, to the modelling process. The government made the assumption at the outset that there would be no reduction in jobs and that employment would grow, so it is not a function of any modelling. Senator Carr should have done that work, to get an understanding of the impact on his portfolio. He is being negligent by not doing that work to get an understanding of the impact on his portfolio.</para>
<para>In fact, at estimates last week we heard that there are tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs that have disappeared from his portfolio in the last three years, since this government took over. And here is the minister who was so much in favour of manufacturing, the minister who was going to save manufacturing and manufacturing jobs in this country. He has completely failed: 87,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared from this country since he became the minister. He wants to impose additional costs on those business, and has done no work to get any understanding of what the impact of government decisions might be. Senator Carr says it is being done by others, when in fact it is not—as I said before, it is an input of the modelling that was done by the government. So they have no understanding of the impact of this tax on jobs, no understanding of the impact on manufacturing in regional Australia.</para>
<para>It was absolutely no surprise when the CEO of BlueScope Steel said that ‘manufacturing policy is now being directed by members of a government who show complete ignorance’. They do not want to listen. You can be part of any council you like. You can be part of the manufacturing councils, you can have input—but, if the government are not listening to you, what impact can that have? If the government do not want to know, what impact can you have? They are in complete ignorance; they do not want to listen. They are engaged in economic vandalism. These are considered statements by the CEO of a major Australian company in relation to the person who is directing manufacturing policy in this country—a person who does no background research, who has no understanding of what is going on, who does not want to listen and who does not seem to care whether or not there are manufacturing jobs in this country. What a complete and utter indictment on the minister.</para>
<para>But of course all of this is compounded by the government’s complete breach of promise in relation to this carbon tax. The Prime Minister went to the election saying that there would be no carbon tax. It was repeated and repeated in context in relation to statements that were being made about a carbon tax. To quote the Prime Minister:</para>

</continue>
<para>Yet we know that there are senators opposite who would support our approach. They believe in a price on carbon. We have a major economic reform and, I believe, the right approach to this issue. We need certainty for business, a case that has been well stated by our ministers today. In fact, a delay means business will not be able to make decisions. It drives up costs for businesses and costs for Australian consumers.</para>
<para>We know, this nation knows and this parliament should know that we need to shift to an economy that produces less pollution so that we can make goods that produce less pollution more attractive; in other words, goods that create less pollution should cost less than those that create a lot of pollution. It is a rational approach. The sooner we move on this journey, the cheaper that journey will be.</para>
<para>We also have climate scientists around the world telling us that carbon pollution is causing climate change and that the scientific case demonstrating this is in fact overwhelming. I am pleased to say that this government accepts the climate science. We know that the world is warming. 2010 was the equal warmest year on record, with 2001-10 being the warmest decade. In a summer where we have experienced such extreme weather events around the nation, we really need to ask ourselves, ‘Can we not participate with the globe in creating an insurance against this kind of effect on our population?’ No responsible government can ignore these findings, which is why we need to make a start now in reducing carbon pollution. We need to play our part in the world’s efforts to save our planet.</para>
<para>But these moves, as demonstrated today, are also about driving innovation, creating jobs and building a stronger economy. We know that the world must move and if we lag behind we lose economically and our environment loses. The same scare campaigns have been run every time a government has set out on a major economic reform, such as reducing tariffs. It is easy to put off reform, to ignore the negative impacts of a patchwork economy and to ignore the challenges of climate change. We have been talking about a price on carbon for a long time, as have the opposition. But we know that, just like reducing tariffs, it is about creating jobs and building a stronger economy. It is about driving investment in clean energy and creating the jobs of the future. It is about business certainty. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The question time we have just sat through demonstrates how those on the other side have absolutely no appreciation of the magnitude of the effect that a carbon tax will have on this country. How surprised I was to hear the question from Senator Bishop to Senator Conroy suggesting that the planet was going to be saved by the introduction of the NBN and that there was some relationship, some strong connection, between the rollout of an expensive NBN program and climate change. It is a poor reflection on those on the other side that they would seek to trivialise such an important debate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But I guess I should not be surprised at all, because in the past week we have seen a disgraceful and outrageous abuse of the democratic rights of Australian citizens by this alliance government of Labor and the Greens. Let us call it what it is, and that is exactly what it is: an unholy alliance between the Labor Party and the Greens. In the very words of the Prime Minister before 21 August 2010, when we had the federal election:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There will no carbon tax under a government I lead.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Let us reflect on this for a moment. This was no quick response to a doorstop. Again, days later—and we saw reports of it in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>—the Prime Minister confirmed that she was ruling out a carbon tax, period. But let us remember the context in which she made that statement and that pledge to the Australian people. At the time, the Labor Party was on the nose. The Labor government was on the nose because its own supporters were absolutely appalled at the way in which former Prime Minister Rudd was stabbed in the back. They were absolutely horrified. If they could not trust the gang of four—if they could not trust caucus with the numbers men wielding the power, and a couple of them share this chamber here with us: Senator Feeney and Senator Farrell—who could they trust? It is good to see that they were both promoted for their actions.</para>
<para>Prime Minister Gillard, in response to that, sashayed around trying to demonstrate her fitness for the job and in the process—surprise, surprise!—was not seen to be that real. In fact, she was seen to be stage managed and fake. Then we heard from the Prime Minister herself that the ‘real Julia’ would stand up—not the one who had been turning up to the contrived media opportunities but the real Julia. And so it was presumably the real Prime Minister Julia Gillard who made that pledge that there would be no carbon tax under her leadership. To be honest, I am staggered that she does not blush at the absolute hypocrisy implied by this backflip, but we have all seen that no lack of principle or honour seems to worry this government. Embarrassment certainly is not one of those things that the Prime Minister seems to suffer from.</para>
<para>We all saw, in the photo shoot of that carbon tax press statement, just who was in control of this particular policy. We had Senator Bob Brown at front and centre of the photo. In fact, I am reminded of <inline font-style="italic">The Addams Family</inline>, for those of you who watched that television program a couple of decades ago. As I looked at that photo I wondered which one was Uncle Fester, the one who could put the light globe in his mouth and set it alight. Looking at Senator Milne, who was standing beside Senator Brown in the centre of the photo, I thought it might be Senator Milne, because she had a radiant glow. If one was in doubt of what was behind this policy, that photo should attest to it. This carbon tax is a disgrace, this government is a disgrace and the Australian people should boot them out sooner rather than later. (<inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline>)</para>

<para>—I rise to take note of answers provided by Ministers Wong, Carr and Evans today. It appears as though those people opposite were not listening to the answers provided. They have just gone off at their own tangent. A carbon price is a major economic reform that will create an incentive to reduce pollution and drive investment in renewable energy and low emissions technologies. The government recognises the concerns of industry in adapting to a clean energy future and adopting carbon pricing. However, the introduction of a price on carbon is an essential economic reform that will help Australian business, industry and communities to combat future challenges. Origin Energy, in a media release, said:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">... today’s announcement was an important step forwards in locking in long term investment certainty for both the clean energy industry and the power sector as a whole.</para>
<para class="block"> “A carbon price must be the cornerstone of any effective climate change strategy” ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Multi-Party Climate Change Committee has agreed on the principle that appropriate account will be taken of the impacts on the competitiveness of all Australian industries, having regard to the carbon prices of other countries while maintaining incentives to reduce pollution. Meeting Australia’s emissions reduction target without having a price on carbon would be more costly than doing it by harnessing the power of a carbon price.</para>
<para>A price on carbon is the most efficient and effective way to reduce carbon pollution. It will create incentives throughout the economy for people to reduce carbon emissions, either through adopting existing technologies and practices or by finding smart and innovative new ways of doing it. The Climate Institute’s <inline font-style="italic">Clean energy jobs in regional Australia</inline> report, released on Monday, 28 February, predicts that a substantial carbon price would trigger tens of billions of dollars of investment in geothermal, large-scale solar, bioenergy, hydro, wind and gas. This is important work and it highlights the opportunities that could be created for Australian manufacturers in these emerging industries.</para>

<para>—Unless those opposite have been living under rocks without radios, televisions, newspapers or internet access, then they should know that Labor advocated long and hard for a carbon pricing regime between 2007 and 2010. Everyone in this chamber is aware of that. And it is what we spoke to the Australian community about during the 2010 election. We have always been upfront that the best way to do this is through a price on carbon.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>A carbon price is a price on pollution. The best way to stop businesses polluting and to get them to invest in clean energy is to charge them when they pollute. The businesses with the highest levels of pollution will have a very strong incentive to reduce their pollution. Make no mistake: those opposite do themselves and the Australian people no justice by running a scaremongering campaign.</para>
<para>This government is very conscious of the cost-of-living pressures facing Australian families. That is why we have already reduced the tax burden on families, we abolished Work Choices, we increased the pension, we increased the childcare rebate and we introduced the education tax refund. That is why we are delivering an increase of $4,000 in family tax benefit part A, extending the education tax refund to uniforms and providing the option for families to receive childcare rebate payments fortnightly. All of these initiatives are fully costed and fully funded. We also understand that central to dealing with the cost-of-living pressures on working Australians is the government’s plan for a stronger economy, because a stronger economy means more jobs and better wages. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I also rise to take note of answers by the ministers named by others. I have great trouble saying that I am going to take note of answers, because there were in fact no answers. Senator Carr told us that he had not done any modelling at all on jobs in the manufacturing area. Manufacturing has lost almost 90,000 jobs during Senator Carr’s time allegedly in charge of the functioning of manufacturing, looking after them with his tender mercies.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Conroy laughably suggested that teleworking is somehow all by itself going to get rid of climate change and overcome emissions. Let us look at that. Firstly, was that a confirmation that there will be a carbon tax on petrol? Is that an extra incentive for people to stay at home and work rather than go to work? The teleworking industry has been growing at a rapid pace without either spending billions of dollars on the NBN or a carbon tax, so I am not quite sure what the massive change is that Senator Conroy is hoping to achieve here.</para>
<para>Then there were the answers of other senators, which bring us back to the basic point of this carbon tax that the government proposed last Thursday out of the blue. Senator Pratt had the nerve to suggest that we had not looked at the detail. We would love to look at the detail. Where is the detail? Are our trade exposed industries covered? Are manufacturing businesses that will suffer because of higher prices and an inability to charge their customers more covered? Who knows? Is petrol covered? The list goes on and on. What is the price of carbon going to be set at? If it is set at $26 a tonne, we are looking at more than $300 extra for electricity for the average Australian family, we are looking at about 6.5c a litre more for petrol for the average Australian family and we are looking at about an extra $100 a year for gas for the average Australian family. The price of manufactured goods—if they can get them—will go up or these people will simply have to go offshore or close down. The price of groceries and food will go up. So we would love to examine the detail of this proposed carbon tax. But all we got was this little bubble—this concept idea—from Ms Gillard, with her friends in tow.</para>
<para>One of the things that have puzzled the coalition and that we have been trying to understand since last Thursday is how on earth the Prime Minister could so shamelessly lie and break an election promise as she did. As a number of people have quoted, just before the election the Prime Minister said, ‘There will no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ We found it inconceivable that the Prime Minister could say that in August and do what she did, alleging changed circumstances.</para>
<para>I think perhaps what has happened is that we are misreading her comment of 10 August. It is not the ‘no carbon tax’ part of the promise that we should be looking at; it is the ‘under the government I lead’ part that we should be looking at. As she points out, in the present circumstances she does not lead the government. It is not the government she leads anymore, so the honest and right thing to do would be to go to an election to see what the people of Australia think about her carbon tax idea and to confirm whether it is she who leads the government or whether it is Senator Bob Brown, Mr Combet or Mr Shorten who leads this government. It certainly is not the Prime Minister, but she should have the courage to find this out at an election. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I move:</para>
</talk.start>
<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business (Senator Sherry) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ludlam today relating to a proposed radioactive waste site at Muckaty Station, Northern Territory.</para>
</motion>
<para>I put three questions to Senator Carr, who has held the portfolio of Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research since the 2007 election, and was referred—or fobbed off, should I say—to Senator Sherry. The first question I put regarding the establishment of a radioactive waste facility at Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory was around recommendation 1 of the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Committee into the provisions of the <inline ref="R4472">National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010</inline>, which I believe will shortly be before the Senate. Recommendation 1 said that before this project goes ahead, if indeed it ever does, the minister should as soon as possible meet with the affected parties. That does not sound too controversial to me. It was a unanimous recommendation that the minister should sit down—he should have the courage and, indeed, the basic courtesy to do that—on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and the coalition members and senators, who may well vote for this proposal when it comes to the Senate, and tell the traditional owners and the people in the broader community up there around Tennant Creek and Muckaty Station why the facility is going there, why they have been chosen. The recommendation of the committee was that until he does that this project should not proceed. I do not think that is controversial at all.</para>
<para>Many of the affected landholders up there have such serious reservations about this proposal that they have taken the government and the Northern Land Council on in the Federal Court. One of those traditional owners, Mr Mark Lane, who is a named applicant in that Federal Court action, was in the public gallery today and is still here in Parliament House. He should not be wasting his time with an action like this over land tenure, and the government should not be moving to dump this material on their land in the Northern Territory at least until the tenure issues are sorted out and we know who has traditional responsibility for that area. It is absolutely outrageous that the government should be proposing to dump the most dangerous industrial materials that this country produces—to put them in shipping containers on semitrailers and take them to a cattle station. It is absolutely ridiculous. For the government to be proceeding, with the consent of the opposition I understand, to legislate on this matter before we even know who has responsibility for that country speaks to me of the concept of terra nullius. I think that is something that most members of this chamber and the other place would have hoped we had set to rest. But that is effectively what this is: we are treating it as though it is empty land.</para>
<para>The other questions that I asked probably seem to have come somewhat out of left field. Why, subsequent to the 2007 election, was responsibility for radioactive waste management transferred from the Science and Innovation portfolio, where it had been in various guises probably since the 1950s, and suddenly yanked across and put in Resources and Energy? To this day, I have no idea what that was about. It was taken out of the portfolio responsibilities that Senator Carr had when he was in opposition and transferred to the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, who has shown blatant disregard for the rights of landholders and, in fact, for the entire Northern Territory community. Perhaps the Labor Party just think there is a handful of seats up there that they can do away with. Perhaps there is some kind of rather nasty political calculus at work that says, ‘It doesn’t really matter if the coalition or, heaven help us, even the Greens bowl over a couple of seats in the Territory, we can dump it up there.’ It is not happening. That material is not going to Muckaty Station, and this minister will have cost the country collectively several years by taking up this failed approach. He would know, if he had studied the limited history in this country of attempting to coercively dump radioactive waste on people, that this will end in failure. Now there is a tenure dispute in the Federal Court. We will be contesting this legislation when it comes into this chamber. When the minister sees the people who turn up at his office every so often and make a public spectacle of his disastrous handling of this issue he should know that will continue—it will intensify. Nobody is going away until this issue has been sorted.</para>
<para>The last issue, I suppose, is something of a longer term one: take it out of the politics and remember what this debate is about. What is the nature of this material that will still be ticking tens of thousands of years after we have gone? Why are we insisting on dumping it at a remote location? I do not believe that material is going to Muckaty, but if we defeat it at Muckaty where will the government turn to? What is the obsession with asking the question: which remote Aboriginal community should get this toxic material? We will move amendments to the bill when it is debated in this chamber, probably not too far away from now, that will back off the postcode issue of which politically vulnerable community we can dump this toxic garbage on and that will establish a commission in the cold light of day to look at the proper way of dealing with this waste. What do we mean by world’s best practice? Community consultation, siting this material close to the areas of expertise and the people who generated it, and stop producing this material in the first place.</para>

<para>—In any normal environment it would be unbelievable to hear a government propose a massive new tax, a change in the fundamental way in which Australian businesses operate that is going to have a profound impact on Australian families, without any detail. In the normal range of circumstances, that would be simply impossible for the Australian people to swallow. But it is the track record of this government that they throw policy options out there and they say, ‘This is what we’re going to do, but don’t worry about the detail—we’ll fix that up later on.’ They are softening the Australian people up again and again and again, and they are conning the Australian people. That is precisely what is happening here, but the Australian people will not swallow it. They will not accept it anymore, because the track record and the legacy of this government is one of failure, incompetence and waste. There is no reason any Australian should have any confidence in this government’s ability to introduce a carbon tax in this economy in an efficient, practical manner whilst not putting forward all the detail.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no doubt that those on the other side of the chamber will say, ‘We will provide the detail at a later stage; we are just agreeing on the framework right now.’ But Ms Gillard is damned by her own statements. On the one hand, she and her acolytes and advocates are out there saying that we have to put a price on carbon so it will be more expensive and so we can change people’s behaviour. On the other hand, she says that we are going to compensate families for the cost-of-living pressures and the increases in their electricity bills—in fact everything they use. We are going to compensate them and sometimes maybe overly compensate them, which will not make them change their behaviour one little bit. But what we can be very sure of is that Ms Gillard cannot be trusted. We know she said she would not implement a carbon tax, and yet she is introducing one now. We know she said she would not knife Kevin Rudd, but she did anyway. This government cannot be trusted on the big policy issues or the detail.</para>
<para>What I would say to Ms Gillard and those opposite, who conveniently forget about the families of Australia, except at election time, is that the families of Australia are already struggling. They are already struggling with cost-of-living pressures which are a direct result of the government’s poor policies. Electricity prices have risen, and the government’s justification for future electricity price rises is that they are not responsible for the previous ones. What utter nonsense. They have implemented all these green programs, which have squandered billions of dollars, and they are already adding a billion-plus dollars a year to the price of electricity for consumers.</para>
<para>Cost-of-living pressures with regard to housing and interest rates are increasing. The government will say, ‘That is not us—our hands are not on the levers.’ But when you inject a hundred billion dollars or more of borrowed money into any economy, you see interest rates rise; that is just common sense. If it were not for this government’s wasteful spending and extravagant borrowing, we would not have interest rates anywhere near the mark they are at now. But of course the government does not want to know about that.</para>
<para>Food costs for Australian people are rising exponentially and the government do not seem to care. Already, we have predictions that fruit and vegetable prices are going to rise by up to 15 or 16 per cent in the months ahead. That is one estimate by a bunch of leading economists. But the government do not seem to care about that. They keep talking about how inflation is running at 2.5 per cent and saying that that should be okay because it is under the RBA’s threshold band. Let me tell you that the reality out there in punterville is that the cost of living is rising by 4½ or five per cent every year, because the official inflation rate is mitigated by things that are unnecessary, that are discretionary items for the Australian people. Unfortunately for the Australian people, housing and transport and food are not discretionary items and the cost of those things is devastating Australian families at the moment. Those are the things that the government are in absolute denial about, because they do not seem to care. They have never seen a problem that could not benefit from another tax. They have never seen a problem that could not be fixed by more government intervention and taking control of the lives of so many Australians. This is the great tragedy of it. The government are squandering a wonderful legacy—a legacy of prudent financial management, preparing for the future. Another generation—possibly two generations—of Australians have been sentenced to debt and serfdom at the feet of an extravagant, wasteful and hopeless government.</para>
<para>We know that there are those among us in society who are really struggling more than others. Welfare recipients, for example, have seen their cost of living increase by in excess of four per cent. We know that pensioners had their cost of living rise by 3.1 per cent over the year. Yet this government is now proposing to add a tax that will increase the cost of living for everyone. It will not go away, because we know that the whole point is to ratchet it up again and again and again, every year, so that there is increasing pressure on people for the things that they need every single day of their lives. We are not talking about international air travel or anything like that—although that will be much more expensive. We are talking about when you start your car to drive down to the shops: it is going to cost more. When you turn on your lights or cook some toast or use electricity for anything in your house it is going to cost more. We know that when you go to the shop it is going to cost more, not only because of the increased costs for business but because the food is going to be higher priced.</para>
<para>I saw an interesting table today outlining the costs for the top companies in Australia of a carbon tax of $26 a tonne. For one energy generation company a carbon tax of $26 per tonne will lead to an estimated cost of $623-plus million. Do you think this company are going to absorb that? Of course they are not going to. They are going to pass it on to every single consumer. And so it will go down the line when Woodside Petroleum are responsible for another couple of hundred million dollars in additional imposts by this government. The simple fact is this: this government has run out of money and it has run out of ideas and it knows that what it does with regard to a carbon tax is not going to make one jot or tittle of difference to the environment or the climate. It is not going to make a difference to the temperatures around the globe. Yet it is pursuing this ideological agenda because it has run out of cash and it needs a justification for it.</para>
<para>Let me tell you that the Australian people are rapidly running out of cash too. They cannot continue to prop up a defunct, dud, deadbeat government. We have seen the results of what happens when that takes place overseas. We have seen comparable partners and comparable democracies struggle under the yoke of debt that has devastated their economies. We cannot afford to let that happen. But equally, we cannot afford to cripple Australian business, enterprise or industry under the weight of attacks that are unnecessary, unwise and self-indulgent. This measure is not going to make a difference to the environment; we know that. But we also know that it is going to make a huge difference to Australia’s competitiveness internationally. It is going to swallow up the profits of many companies unless they can pass the costs on—and they will have to do that in order to remain competitive for the cost of funds. We know that the government do not seem to care about the health and wellbeing of industry, which not only provides jobs for tens or millions of Australians but also provides our future base for prosperity. They do not care about that. They only care about the immediate needs that they have. That is a very selfish attitude for a government.</para>
<para>One thing that struck me when Ms Gillard announced this—I should say Senator Brown announced it; Ms Gillard played sidekick to him—was that she said, ‘Bill Gates was at the forefront of the digital revolution and look how wealthy he has become.’ Anyone who thinks that indulging in a new tax that is going to put Australian industry at a competitive disadvantage is somehow riding a great wave of future prosperity is fooling themselves; they are living in a fool’s paradise. You actually create wealth by creating something that people want. I have not met anyone who wants a new tax except those on the other side of the chamber and, unfortunately, the Greens. They are the people that want a new tax, because they are desperate for it. If you really want to have a competitive workplace and to promote industry in this country you do not slug those who are trying to build wealth, but the government does not seem to understand that.</para>
<para>And then we hear about the other aspect of it, which is the green jobs it is going to create. We can only look at the examples of those countries which have pursued such an ideological agenda. Germany has dumped it because they have realised that any jobs that have been created have been offset by two or three times as many losses and that there are billions and tens of billions of dollars in subsidies that are necessary every single year.</para>
<para>Have a look at Spain. Spain is as close to bankrupt as any economy in Europe, basically because they pursued this ideological green agenda. There is so much to learn from right around the world about the policies that this government is advocating, which are failing internationally. They are going to fail the Australian people, and the fact is that this government will not explain them because they are tenderising the Australian people before they slug them onto the hot frying pan and try to cook them.</para>
<para>But the goose of this government is what should be cooked. This government should be plucked, it should be tarred and feathered and it should be splayed flat out and destroyed by the Australian people because they have failed miserably.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise today to speak on the matter of public importance motion and to counter some of the claims made by those opposite. Firstly, let us be very clear right from the start: when the Prime Minister outlined the proposed carbon price mechanism last week she made it clear that this is an essential economic reform, and that it is the right thing to do. If we delay now we risk being left behind as the global economy transitions towards a low-pollution economy. It is a public policy responsibility to respond to the findings of the overwhelming majority of scientists on climate change. The scientific evidence is clear and we will act on it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Placing a carbon price on pollution is the cheapest and fairest way to cut emissions. A price on carbon is essentially a price on pollution, and this is the most effective way to transition to a clean energy economy. The Australian economy is an emissions-intensive economy. The method of pricing carbon is the best way to encourage businesses to stop polluting and to get them to invest in clean energy.</para>
<para>As part of the renewed focus on clean energy, the Labor government have proposed a two-stage process for a carbon price mechanism. Firstly, we will start with a fixed price period of between three and five years. After this time we will transition to an emissions trading scheme. If the government are able to negotiate an agreement with the majority of both houses of parliament and to pass legislation on putting a price on carbon it is our intention to start the scheme on 1 July 2012.</para>
<para>I will point out to those opposite, and this goes right to the crux of today’s MPI motion, that every cent raised by placing a price on carbon will go to households, to businesses and to tackling climate change. We have been very clear right from the start: a carbon price will impact prices on certain goods and services. This is the whole point of a market mechanism; it sends a signal and markets respond. The carbon price will be paid by businesses that emit large amounts of pollution.</para>
<para>But what is disappointing is the disingenuous scare campaign coming from those opposite relating to the impacts for consumers. Over the past few days we have heard political scaremongering and mistruths from those opposite. They have been employing fear tactics of the highest order. This is exactly what we have come to expect from those opposite, because after all they are a party with a leader who is now a renowned climate change sceptic. For those opposite, it is worth remembering that under the leadership of the Hon. John Howard, who many would deem to be a fairly conservative member of the Liberal Party—indeed, I believe he is a fairly conservative member of the Liberal Party—those opposite actually had a climate change policy in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election. It placed a price on carbon through an emissions trading scheme.</para>
<para>Those opposite also had an agreement with the government to place a price on carbon before the sceptics, led by the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, and Senator Abetz, took over the leadership of the party and reneged on the deal. With the climate change sceptics reigning supreme in the Liberal Party we are faced with this political point-scoring and fearmongering. It is not helpful in the debate and it does nothing but alarm people unnecessarily. But it is hardly surprising those opposite have opted to take this low road.</para>
<para>We will ensure households receive assistance to cope with the changes that a carbon price brings. For those opposite to lecture this government on cost of living is beyond belief. In our time in government we have done more to ease the cost-of-living pressures faced by households than those opposite ever contemplated in their decade of government.</para>
<para>We have reduced the tax burden on families—not once, not twice but three times. We have abolished Work Choices, increased the pension, increased the childcare rebate and introduced the education tax refund. All of these initiatives were delivered within our responsible fiscal rules. We are also pressing ahead with new initiatives to combat the cost-of-living pressures; that is why we are delivering an increase of $4,000 in family tax benefit part A, extending the education tax refund to uniforms, giving the option for families to receive childcare rebate payments fortnightly and introducing paid parental leave for mums and dads.</para>
<para>We also understand that central to dealing with the cost-of-living pressures on working Australians is the government’s plan for a stronger economy, because a stronger economy means more jobs and better wages. Nothing could be more apparent than this government’s commitment to tackling cost-of-living pressures, and for those opposite to suggest otherwise is just ridiculous.</para>
<para>Let us be clear why we have announced our intention to place a price on carbon, as the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency highlighted in the other place yesterday:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Climate scientists are telling governments all over the world that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change. The scientific consensus is overwhelming and the government respects the climate science. A government in that circumstance has a public policy responsibility to act upon that advice in everyone’s interests and we simply need to make a start in reducing carbon pollution in our economy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is the responsible action for our government to place a price on carbon; we have delayed for too long. We must act now. If we do not act, Australia risks being left behind. This will hurt the Australian economy and cost Australian jobs. There has been too much uncertainty for too long. Businesses need certainty so they can plan for the future and maximise the opportunities that will rise from this reform. And this is what we are doing; we are stating our intention to price carbon, to give businesses some certainty.</para>
<para>And what are the opposition doing? I will tell you. Those opposite, led by Mr Abbott, have taken a reckless position and are threatening to wind back our price on carbon. As the Prime Minister has said:</para>
<quote>
<para>… the Leader of the Opposition has confirmed that he now holds the most reckless political position taken by a national leader in the last 15 years. After we have priced carbon, given businesses certainty and households assistance, he is committed to ripping all of that up—the most reckless political position taken by a national leader in 15 years.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">At a time when we are providing businesses with certainty and taking action on climate change, Mr Abbott and those opposite want to tear it all down. If we delay any longer we will miss the boat. The global economy is already shifting to a clean economy. Thirty-two countries and 10 US states are already moving towards an emissions trading scheme.</para>
<para>Australia has the highest emissions per capita in the developed world—even higher than the United States. It is our responsibility to take action now. If we do not act we risk Australian businesses and households being left behind. The global economy is already moving to cut pollution, and if we are left behind it will hurt our economy and cost jobs. We have already had positive research released by the Climate Institute about the job creation prospects of pricing carbon. The facts and the science are clear: the benefits of taking action on climate change in the immediate future far outweigh continual delay. The Labor government has always been committed to taking action on climate change.</para>
<para>On the other hand, Mr Abbott is taking a reckless and irresponsible position. As the Prime Minister highlighted on radio and in parliament, Mr Abbott is sending a terrible signal to international markets that Australia is a risky place to invest. By saying he will repeal a carbon tax, Mr Abbott is damaging our international reputation. This is a dreadful position to be taking. It is particularly concerning for businesses that have made decisions to invest in Australia based on a carbon price, especially in the energy sector where we want to see clean energy investment.</para>
<para>Whilst Mr Abbott maintains that position now, who knows what his position will be in the coming months? In the short time of just 2½ years Mr Abbott has had at least eight different positions on climate change. Mr Abbott has flipped-flopped all over the place between support for an emissions trading scheme and his statement of absolute climate change denial. Only the Labor government has a plan to cut pollution and to begin to tackle climate change. Even the former Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Wentworth, Mr Turnbull said:</para>
<quote>
<para>… politics is about conviction and a commitment to carry out those convictions. The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is ‘crap’ and you don’t need to do anything about it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This highlights that Mr Abbott is a climate change denier; he does not believe in the science and has no plan to tackle climate change. The government do have a plan for the future, and we want to give businesses and households certainty. All Mr Abbott wants to do is partake in a scare campaign to score political points. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The proposed carbon tax will come into effect on 1 July 2012. Coincidentally, that is the beginning of the 2012-13 financial year—the very year the government expects to bring the budget back into surplus. I would imagine that the ordinary Australian would rather pay less tax and see more government spending restraint, especially given the waste found in stimulus spending on projects like the Building the Education Revolution and pink batts, in order to achieve any future budget surpluses.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A carbon tax will add to the already overstretched home budget of many Australian families. They will have increased cost-of-living pressures imposed on them every time they go grocery shopping, every time they turn on the lights at night and every time they fill up the car with petrol when taking children to school. The proposed carbon tax comes on the back of a mining tax which will also slug families with higher prices at the counter and for lighting, warming or cooling the home. The cumulative effect of the two taxes will put more pressure on household budgets that are already struggling with mortgages, the costs of education and transportation, and food prices.</para>
<para>The Reserve Bank forecasts that the impact of floods and Cyclone Yasi over summer will be a three per cent rise in the CPI inflation rate on items like fruit and vegetables—the effect of which is already compounded by the introduction of a flood levy. In the year to February the TD Securities and Melbourne Institute inflation gauge rose by 3.6 per cent—well outside the RBA’s two to three percent band. TD Securities reported that prices have risen over 16 consecutive months and should be above three per cent since September last year.</para>
<para>There is little wonder then that retail spending is not as robust as one would hope and that the saving rate has increased from negative two per cent to positive 10 per cent since the global financial crisis. This is a very responsible attitude on behalf of citizens, but for the economy to go around Australian families need to do more than just spend on essentials and save for rainy days. All of these cost-of-living pressures arrived in concert with the announcement of a carbon tax to begin just next year.</para>
<para>How are hardworking Australians expected to shoulder the burden of inflation and the Gillard government’s increasing dependency on, and proclivity to, tax, tax, tax? In my home state of Victoria, households are facing increases in the cost of water and electricity as a result of past failed state Labor policies, yet the federal government turns it head the other way on the pressures already faced by Victorians. The fact of the matter is that the real architect behind this policy is the Greens, not Labor.</para>
<para>Given Prime Minister Gillard’s ‘there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead’ election promise, it is clear that the government has been dragged kicking and screaming to this position, behind closed doors, to remain in favour with a minor party like the Greens. We know that Prime Minister Gillard was the one that advised former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to drop his commitment to an ETS. Let the public record show that the Greens have taken full credit for the recent announcement on a carbon tax.</para>
<para>I take note of Senator Milne’s push for a ‘high enough carbon price’ which is to be linked by achieving the Greens aspirational carbon dioxide reduction target of 25 per cent of 2000 emission levels by 2020. No price has yet been set but we can imagine that behind closed doors the carbon tax architects will be pushing for the highest possible price. Concern for the environment is one thing but to foist a tax on struggling families is economic vandalism. The Greens also propose to put petrol in the equation. There are already substantial price fluctuations on the world market for oil given the current political and civil instability in oil producing nations. Economics 101 teaches us that with higher oil prices consumption at the bowser is lessened. Australian families are already dealing with this simple economic principle. So, should we reasonably expect Australian businesses and households to absorb more and more of the spiralling cost of petrol and ask them to limit their movements? If you were going to use public transport, the public transport in Victoria has been a very unreliable alternative given past state Labor policy failures.</para>
<para>We are not to expect a static price lift annually with the carbon price but a dynamic price surge in the cost of living over the three- to five-year period. How much will the tax increase annually? I am afraid this proposal raises more questions than it seeks to answer.</para>
<para>The cost to industry should not be left unreported. BlueScope’s Paul O’Malley has already signalled that a carbon tax poses a threat to manufacturing in Australia. Mr O’Malley claims that with a carbon tax:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… imports will get a free ride, and Australian manufacturing will be taxed, and there will absolutely be leakage …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Economists like Alan Kohler and Terry McCrann have backed these concerns. Will the Greens stand up to scrutiny when cost-of-living pressures begin to weigh down on the backs of hardworking Australians?</para>
<para>Prime Minister Gillard and the Labor Party sought to make comparisons with Prime Minister John Howard’s introduction of the GST, but it is educational to note that the purpose of the GST was to broaden the base of the tax regime and ultimately lower the rate of taxes. This carbon price is designed to do nothing of the sort.</para>
<para>It is well known that I support action on climate change, but the ETS of some 14 months ago, with the Malcolm Turnbull amendments that I supported, is a very far cry from this heavy-handed slug on consumers and industry alike. Australian families, taxpayers and business will live to regret the day that this tax is introduced.</para>

<para>—The bluster and hot air coming from the other side of the Senate chamber on this issue and the contrived outrage we have heard during the week demonstrates one thing, that no matter what response the government comes up with to tackle the monumental challenge of climate change those opposite will oppose it. They will oppose it because they want to delay, because they want to frustrate and because they want to obfuscate. Why do they want to stop action on climate change? Because the ranks of the coalition are dominated by climate change sceptics and climate change deniers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If there is any better demonstration that the coalition are opposed to action on climate change it is that they previously rolled their own leader over this very issue. You might remember we previously had an agreement with the opposition, which was when Mr Turnbull was leader, to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and to get on with the business of tackling the greatest economic and environmental challenge to face our nation, and what did they do? They rolled their leader. Let us not forget that the current leader of the opposition, Tony Abbott, came to the leadership on a platform of opposing action on climate change. In fact he described the science of climate change as ‘absolute crap’. That explains a lot about where he is coming from and it explains a lot about where the opposition is coming from.</para>
<para>As a further demonstration of the opposition’s determination not to act on climate change, they refused to join the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. We extended an invitation to them to work together with us, the minor parties and independents, to come up with a solution that was in the national interest, and they declined. This government is getting on with the job. We are working with the Greens and the Independents through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to come up with a solution that is in the national interest.</para>
<para>If you want to have a debate about election commitments then remember this: we went to the election promising action on climate change and we went to the election saying that the cheapest and fairest way to cut pollution while transitioning to a clean energy economy is to put a price on carbon. It is an interim price as a first step towards an emissions trading scheme. It is the right thing to do for the Australian economy and it is the right thing to do if you are a government that, unlike those opposite, is committed to action on climate change.</para>
<para>A fixed carbon price for the first three to five years of the scheme will help to provide certainty to business. The opposition would have you believe that they know exactly what the price impacts of this policy will be. They know already before we have announced the policy settings, before we have announced which sectors are to be included and excluded and before we have announced what assistance will go to households. They have got out their ouija boards and their crystal balls and they have worked it out. Let me just say, Nostradamus has nothing on them. What the opposition are trying to do with their outlandish claims is run a big, fat scare campaign. Anyone who tries to claim at this stage of the debate that they know the impact a carbon price will have on prices and households either has an exaggerated sense of their predictive powers or is just being downright dishonest.</para>
<para>When the party of the GST and the party of Work Choices suddenly discover cost-of-living pressures, you cannot help but be just a tad suspicious about their motives. But there are a few salient facts that they fail to point out when it comes to their scare campaign. For example, unlike so-called direct action, a carbon price raises revenue that can be used to assist households. When we put in place a carbon price, the money raised will not be used to prop up the budget. Every cent raised from the introduction of a carbon price will go to three things: assistance to families to help with their household bills; initiatives to help business to transition to a clean energy economy; and measures to tackle climate change and invest in a clean energy future.</para>
<para>The opposition also fails to realise that a carbon price is a more cost-efficient mechanism for tackling climate change. On the question of a carbon price and its effect on electricity prices, let us hear the words of Mr Rod Sims, an adviser to the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. In November 2010 he wrote about the emissions reduction target of five per cent of 2000 levels by 2020:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If Australia wishes to meet this target it can choose between at least two approaches: continue using the current high cost and non market mechanisms … or introduce a carbon price. Electricity prices will in future be lower if we take the latter path of meeting a given greenhouse gas reduction target through the introduction of a carbon price.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The biggest driver of electricity prices in Australia is the need for significant network investment over the next five years, and the uncertainty caused by having no carbon price is also helping to drive up electricity prices. Of course a carbon price will change prices. That is the whole point of a market mechanism—it sends a signal and the market responds. The way that we begin to shift to an economy which produces less pollution is to make the goods that create less carbon pollution cost less than the goods that create a lot of carbon pollution.</para>
<para>The opposition would have you believe that, in introducing a carbon price, Australia would be moving ahead of other developed countries. Let us examine that claim. The European Union has had an emissions trading scheme in place since 2005. The New Zealand emissions trading scheme commenced for forestry in January 2008 and for other sectors on 1 July 2010. The South Korean Ministry of Environment initiated a trial ETS in January 2010 to operate until 2012. Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland have carbon taxes of various forms currently in place. Several of these schemes have been operating since the early 1990s. To date, 139 countries have expressed their intention to be listed as agreeing to the Copenhagen Accord, and 85 countries, representing 80 percent of global emissions, have pledged emissions reduction targets or actions under the accord. Thirty-two countries and 10 US states are moving to emissions trading schemes. While the rest of the world economy moves to cut pollution, Australia risks being left behind.</para>
<para>We are the world’s highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, higher even than the United States. If we are left behind, it will hurt our economy and cost Australian jobs. If we take the alternative path, however, and introduce a carbon price, this will drive innovation and build a stronger economy. Research from the Climate Institute estimates that 34,000 jobs would result from the clean energy boom if a price were put on carbon. I know those opposite are sceptical, but let us just look at what happened in my home state of Tasmania when the Tasmanian government made huge investments in wind energy. Now the Tasmanian company Roaring 40s, which is part owned by Hydro Tasmania, is exporting its knowledge of wind farm development, which is resulting in returns to the Tasmanian economy.</para>
<para>Of course, the federal opposition do not want to talk about the potential for investment in renewable energy that could flow from a price on carbon. After all, we are talking about a major structural reform to Australia’s economy, and every structural reform is inevitably followed by a scare campaign from those who oppose it. It is easy to put off reform, to ignore the challenges of climate change. However, such is the opposition’s stubbornness, such is their head-in-the-sand approach that they are not only saying they will oppose a carbon price but they say they will roll it back. This just demonstrates how reckless and irresponsible the coalition are with our economic and environmental future. You know what Mr Abbott’s policy of a rollback of a carbon price would do to Australia? It would create uncertainty for business and uncertainty about our energy security, and in an uncertain environment business investment dries up. It would remove household and industry assistance. It would open up Australia’s environmental standing to ridicule. This ridiculous policy is just another demonstration of why Tony Abbott cannot be trusted with Australia’s economic management.</para>
<para>In contrast to the opposition, who continue to deny and delay and frustrate action on climate change, this government is getting on with the job. We are committed to an emissions trading scheme, and in the lead-up to that scheme we will introduce a fixed price on carbon. We will use all of the money raised for household and business assistance and to tackle climate change. We are working through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to determine the policy settings. In the meantime, any claims made about the cost of a litre of petrol or a kilowatt of electricity are just idle speculation from an opposition that wants to run a scare campaign because they do not believe in action of any sort on climate change.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. I cannot remember a greater betrayal of the Australian people. The Prime Minister stood up a week before the election and said, ‘Under my government, there will definitely be no emissions trading or carbon tax.’ Then three or four months later, in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, we are faced with a carbon tax, which is supposed to give us certainty. What is the certainty? I was speaking about this to one of the players yesterday. What is the certainty? We do not know what it is. We do not know how much the carbon tax will be. We do not know when the ETS is going to come in. We do not have the figure for how much it will be escalated. The government have provided the greatest uncertainty for Australia’s industry ever. There is no certainty. No-one knows what is going on out there. You admit it yourselves. You will not tell the people what the price of electricity will be. How can you get certainty with that?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last week the Prime Minister bravely stood outside her office, surrounded by the Greens. She was going to put her stamp of approval on the party. This would be unequivocal. She was going to stand her ground and she was going to tell them. She was going to stand there and put a stamp of authority on this government—no shilly-shallying like Kevin Rudd; she was a woman of authority, and she was going to stand there and tell the Australian people: ‘I know what I’m doing. I’m a person who will take a position.’ The position she took was surrounded by the Greens. It looked as though she had subcontracted the government out to the Greens, and that is what the people are saying.</para>
<para>On Friday I happened to go down to a radio station. That is just a matter of fact. When I was down there I was talking about fishing, but the ETS came up. I put my head in the door and asked if I could say a few words, and I was given three or four minutes. I walked into the next cabinet and talked about fishing and walked out. It probably took half an hour. In that time the switchboard had lit up like a pinball machine. There were calls coming in everywhere. One hundred and sixty calls came in, not from well-heeled people and not from the business community but from the people, the battlers, who had placed their trust in the Labor government. These were not businesspeople; these were people who had to find the money—find the money for increased interest rates, find the money for increased food prices—and they could not see their way clear.</para>
<para>This government has put the price up. I asked the question in estimates the other day: how much is the price going up at $25 a tonne? The answer was that the price will go up 19 per cent, and then when you throw in the green power and renewable energy it goes up another five per cent, so the prices will increase by 24 per cent right across the board. Working families are going to have to find an additional 24 per cent to meet their commitments on electricity. Many people cannot even pay the bills now. Ergon Energy and the other authorities in Queensland are putting out lists of people who cannot meet their electricity costs and are getting their power cut off. So what does the government do? It whacks another 24 per cent increase on it.</para>
<para>It is bad enough for the workers, and it is going to be horrific for them. Many of them are struggling. But they are going to be cheered on by the Volvo socialists. The Volvo socialists are out there being represented by the Greens, and the Greens are taking the Labor Party to the cleaners. It is going to be a holocaust at the next election, because you—the Labor Party—are going to be vying for that 14 per cent vote and you are going to be fighting it out with the Greens. The blue-collar workers have abandoned you, and rightly so, because you have abandoned them. You have abandoned them on fishing. You have abandoned them on electricity. You have abandoned the Aboriginals on Wild Rivers. You have walked away from your base. And you are trying to fight for that 14 per cent that is occupied by the Greens. You will battle it out, and you will probably split the vote fifty-fifty, but you have lost your credibility.</para>
<para>If you do not think this is serious, I refer you to BlueScope Steel. BlueScope was part of BHP. BHP built this nation. It was one of the great companies that built this nation. It employed thousands and thousands and thousands of people. What has happened to BlueScope? Last year BlueScope turned in a minus profit of $50 million.</para>

<para>—Senator O’Brien, if you listen to this, you might even learn something. BlueScope suffered a $50 million loss because of a high dollar, increased imports and global financial problems. What is this government going to do about a company who employ 10,000 people? On their estimation, at $25 a tonne, it is going to cost BlueScope $315 million. So they will not lose $50 million; they will lose $365 million. How does that work? How does that work by giving people certainty? Their expected losses will be $365 million, but it is not only BlueScope; it is OneSteel and it is many, many businesses. Take the case of Qantas. They are going to cop emissions trading. Well, that is all right; they will add it onto the ticket. Everyone will fly United or Singapore Airlines or something like that, disadvantaging our own Australian icon.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I do not think anyone over on that side has ever run a business. They have not run a business. They come in here with prepared speeches—Senator O’Brien probably will not—and get up and rattle off a prepared speech, probably written by the minister’s department. Have you ever, ever gone out there and experienced what it is to run a business, to meet the payroll, to pay the bills? You obviously have not done it.</para>
<para>We are told that the rest of the world are doing it. Well, the rest of the world are not doing it. I would not mind if the rest of the world were doing it. The United States has said, ‘We can’t afford this.’ India cannot afford it—and would you blame them, with people begging on the street for something to eat? Do you think their government are going to put an ETS over their industry? Don’t be stupid; they can’t. Even if they wanted to they could not. What about China? Are they going to do it? No. What about Brazil? No. What about Japan? No. What about Russia? No. We are doing this unilaterally. The EU have an ETS, in a certain way, but even they exclude agriculture, they exclude mining and they exclude 164 industries. They just about have an ETS where you don’t have an ETS. But come in, spinner! Come in, you bunch of mugs! We will fix Australian industry up. We will handicap it with so much tax, and then try and make a virtue out of it by saying we are going to create 34,000 green jobs by putting a tax on people like BlueScope, OneSteel, Qantas and meat processing companies like Teys and Nippon, and saying, ‘We’re being terrific!’ If putting a tax on was so easy, why not double the tax? We could double the number of jobs! It is absolute stupidity.</para>
<para>But even you cannot convince Heather Ridout. She is distancing herself from you today. Heather Ridout, who has been your No. 1 supporter, your fallback position, will not have a bar of it—nor, of course, will the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They have walked away from it too. You have not got a friend out there; you have not got a feather to fly with. You have lost your blue-collar vote and you are trying to fight for that 14 per cent narrow vote, which we call the doctors’ wives or the Volvo socialists. That is the vote you are going to get. You cannot expect the blue-collar workers of Australia ever to support you again, because you have let them down so badly.</para>

<para>—What a shambles of an argument this opposition has put up to this peculiarly worded motion that is before the Senate today—in fact, I do not even think it has been addressed by the speakers who spoke on behalf of it. One could have taken points of order continuously throughout the debate on relevance to the actual question before the chair. Rather than do that, I thought I would wait to see whether there was anything of substance which the speakers on the other side could put. Frankly, I was not disappointed: there was no substance in what they were saying.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Many of the coalition speakers’ arguments today, and indeed their spokesmen and women’s arguments in the community, remind me of a <inline font-style="italic">Peanuts</inline> cartoon which was published many years ago. Charlie Brown and Lucy were standing in a playground, and Charlie Brown had just been telling some people some stories, which he described as ‘little-known facts’. When Lucy asked, ‘Charlie, how do you know all these little-known facts?’ Charlie Brown put his hand up to his mouth and said, ‘I make them up’. That is what we just heard, and that is what we have been hearing from the coalition in this debate all along.</para>
<para>When we go to some of their spokespeople, they have been making up prices for the cost of a price on carbon for some time—making up prices. For example, Mr Hunt, on 6 January last year, said the effect of a carbon price on a family would be $1,100 a year. On <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> on 25 February this year he said it would be $300. Mr Robb, on 27 February in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline>, was reported as saying it would be close to $1,000. Mr O’Farrell says it would be $500 for electricity. I do not know where the rest is coming from. We are hearing all sorts of stories about a price on carbon, and an effect on the community, when you cannot possibly make a calculation until you know what the actual price is—you cannot do it. They are making it up. They keep making stories up, which is part of what we know, and what the Prime Minister warned of on 24 February, when she said, ‘Get ready for it: the mother of all scare campaigns’. And that is what we are seeing from the coalition now: a plain, simple, politics 101 scare campaign, because they have nothing else to say on this issue.</para>
<para>We had the debate in here started by one of the greatest climate change deniers on that side of the chamber, Senator Bernardi. He has some pretty extreme views on other matters, I might say, but on the question of climate change he has the most extreme view I have heard from that side of the chamber. He actually encourages people to avoid reducing energy usage and says that energy usage is part of civilisation and we should use more! So he completely rejects the substantial consensus of the scientific community on climate change and suggests we should flout that, that we should actually make sure we emit more carbon and that it is a good thing. That is essentially what he has been saying.</para>
<para>Senator Troeth, to her credit, supported the ETS proposal that came through this chamber twice. She now says she does not support this, and that is her right. But at least she would look at a cogent argument and understands and accepts that we have a problem that we need to deal with. Senator Troeth, I believe, could be convinced to proceed down a path of seeking a solution, and Australia’s contribution towards a solution, to climate change; but I could not say that of Senator Bernardi, and I certainly could not say that of Senator Boswell.</para>
<para>Senator Boswell comes in here and talks about how we are allegedly betraying the working class. Senator Boswell voted for Work Choices. If there was a betrayal of the working class par excellence, that was it—so it is rich for him to come in here and bemoan the fate of the working class. He ought to front up to the workers in some of those mines and say, ‘Yes, I voted to remove your conditions, to cut your pay, to make your job less secure, but I really like you and I want to protect you.’ They will not believe him. I do not believe him. I do not think this chamber should believe him either.</para>
<para>We have a problem. The world has a problem, and Australia is a part of this globe. We have to find a solution for it. But, at the same time, we have a responsibility to try to equip our industry to deal with the emerging realities of a global approach to climate change. I recall when in this chamber a couple of years ago this government talked about assisting Toyota to manufacture a hybrid vehicle. It was roundly condemned on that side of the chamber. And all of the other measures to encourage production of more-fuel-efficient cars were roundly condemned on that side of the chamber. We now have the Camry hybrid being manufactured here. We have a new Holden vehicle manufactured here. Ford is going to manufacture a four-cylinder vehicle, although it will bring in the engines. These things were not happening before. They mean keeping jobs here in Australia. That is what this government is doing.</para>
<para>In the same way, dealing with the question of a carbon price is to deal with the problems that will threaten the jobs of Australian workers and our entire community, and the viability of our communities. The only thing that a responsible government can do in these circumstances is to try to find a solution. The Prime Minister came before the Australian people and said, ‘We are going to go down this path. We are going to work with the majority of the parliament—we did invite the coalition but they refused to be part of it—to try to find a solution so that we can put a price on carbon and start to address the problems that this nation will have to be part of, because it is a world problem.’ We will have to come up with something that we can implement as soon as possible and get business and industry to establish their processes to deal with this problem. Then, the better will be the chance that Australian industry will survive the problems of the next two, three, four or five decades, when the world has to address the problem of climate change by pricing carbon. One would have thought that the party of the market economy on that side of the chamber would have supported a market driven approach to problem solving in the business community. But, no, they wanted the taxpayer to pay for any solutions. Ultimately, of course, it is the community that pays the tax. So, unless they were going to vastly reduce services, we were going to see the burden—I think it was $20 billion in the next ten years—fall upon the community, as well as the establishment costs. So we have an opposition that has decided for very opportunistic reasons to oppose a proposal that is in the best interests of this nation to deal with the issue of pricing carbon.</para>
<para>You could not really take seriously what the Leader of the Opposition says on this issue. He has had more positions—I was going to say more positions than the <inline font-style="italic">Kama Sutra</inline> on this, but it is probably the wrong approach to take because it is not quite that many. But he has had a great many positions on the question—</para>

Shortly after that, I think it was just a couple of days later, he said, ‘No, we should oppose it.’ Then of course he came out with that infamous comment that described climate change as ‘crap’—I think that was the word he used.

<para>—Before we broke for question time I was saying in the debate on the <inline ref="R4508">Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011</inline> and the <inline ref="R4507">Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011</inline> that I thought most Australians would be happy to pay a modest contribution under such extraordinary circumstances and I was re-emphasising that this levy is a one-off levy. Taxpayers will only have to pay the levy during the 2011-12 financial year. This legislation ensures that this levy will be in place for only 12 months.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government believes the levy is being implemented in a fair way, because people who earn under $50,000 will not have to pay the levy. This means that 50 per cent of Australian taxpayers will not have to pay the levy. They are the 50 per cent who can least afford to pay it, and we are protecting them. People earning above $50,000 will pay according to how much they earn. So those earning between $50,001 and $100,000 will pay 0.5 per cent. People who earn above $100,000 will pay one per cent. As an example, a taxpayer earning $60,000 per annum will pay 96c per week, which is not much when they have received tax cuts of $25.96 per week over the past three years. They are still coming out $25 in front. People earning $80,000 a year will pay $2.88 per week. Even a cup of coffee costs more than that these days. They will pay 10 times less than the tax cuts they have received over the past three years.</para>
<para>It is also important to note that those people affected by the floods will not pay this levy. That includes those seriously affected by recent disasters, including Cyclone Yasi. Exemptions will be provided to people who received an Australian government disaster recovery payment. They will also be provided to people who were affected by a declared disaster and who meet at least one criterion for an Australian government disaster recovery payment, even if they did not receive a payment. An exemption will also be provided to New Zealand special class visa holders who were technically ineligible for the Australian government disaster recovery payments but who have received an ex gratia natural disaster payment.</para>
<para>This legislation also provides for other exemptions to be made under legislation if they are required. As previously mentioned, the levy forms only one part of the flood rebuilding measures. We have also decided to defer some infrastructure projects to help meet the costs. This will allow us to meet capacity constraints and to redirect funds to the rebuilding process that needs to occur. Deferrals are being made in a number of different areas to ensure that they are fair and that no one program or state is burdened greatly. The deferrals will help to free up skilled labour and building materials for reconstruction that must occur.</para>
<para>The next two years are crucial as we manage the reconstruction process and the mining boom. It is important to note that state governments have agreed or at least accepted the deferrals that have been made. There has also been the need to make spending cuts. This is never an easy process but at times it is necessary, and this is one of those necessary times. The Gillard government has acted decisively and made the tough choices. As a government we have kept spending lower than in any single year under the Howard government. The government has capped the National Rental Affordability Scheme and the LPG Vehicle Scheme to limit the costs involved. We have made the tough decisions to cut some funds from lower education priorities because the outcomes can be achieved through other initiatives. One example of this is the capital development pool. Funds from the Building Better Regional Cities program and the Priority Regional Infrastructure program will also be redirected to the flood rebuilding process.</para>
<para>The government has also made the decisions to abolish, defer and cap access to some carbon abatement initiatives. The Green Car Innovation Fund and the Cleaner Car Rebate Scheme are among these. This has been done because these initiatives are less efficient then a carbon price and will no longer be necessary. Other initiatives are best delayed until the full impact of a carbon price has been felt.</para>
<para>Central to these savings is the government’s commitment to a carbon price. Indirect measures have only ever been a poor substitute for a carbon price. They are not needed if we have a carbon price. The Australian government is legislating for a carbon price this year. The government realises that it is important to taxpayers that we are accountable for our management of their money. The federal government has agreed to make an advance payment of $2 billion to the Queensland government to kick-start the rebuilding process. This will be done in the current financial year and will be done as soon as arrangements can be finalised.</para>
<para>Both the Australian government and the Queensland government are putting in place mechanisms to ensure that the money is well spent and managed appropriately. The Australian and Queensland governments will sign a national partnership agreement to establish rigorous conditions for the use of federal funds. The Gillard government has also appointed the well-respected Major General Michael Slater as Chair of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. Prime Minister Julia Gillard has also announced that Mr Brad Orgill and Ms Glenys Beauchamp will sit on the board of the QRA. Both Mr Orgill and Ms Beauchamp are experienced and successful in their fields. The Prime Minister has also appointed Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig as the Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Flood Recovery. Senator Ludwig will sit on the Flood Recovery Cabinet Committee of the Queensland government and provide reports to federal cabinet.</para>
<para>The federal government has established a reconstruction inspectorate to increase scrutiny and accountability throughout the rebuilding process. The inspectorate will report to the cabinet subcommittee on natural disasters, which is chaired and deputy chaired by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean.</para>
<para>Former Premier of New South Wales and former federal Minister for Finance the Hon. John Fahey has been appointed to lead the inspectorate. He will be supported by Mr Martin Albrecht and Mr Matt Sheerin, who are experienced in building and accounting respectively. The inspectorate will have the following powers: to scrutinise contracts, to inspect projects, to investigate complaints made by the public, to liaise with state agencies and to scrutinise requests by local government for reimbursement. The inspectorate will receive support from experts as needed and will require states to provide independently audited financial statements with their claims.</para>
<para>The Gillard government is committed to rebuilding following the devastating floods. We are committed to it for the long haul. Australians stick together in times of need and I am pleased to be part of a nation that has such pride in mateship. To reiterate, I understand that most Australians are happy to pay the small amount that we will be asking them to pay because these are such extraordinary circumstances. It is a one-off levy and it will be paid during the 2011-12 financial year. The bill will ensure that this levy is only imposed for 12 months. We believe that it is being implemented in a fair way.</para>

<para>—I will take that interjection, Senator Williams. Your side are very good at forgetting that you implemented a number of levies during the Howard government years. In 12 years, there were six levies. For your side to jump up and down and say that if we implement a levy then we have not got any financial accountability is completely hypocritical and completely bizarre. The people of Australia realise how bizarre it is for your side to jump up and down and carry on about it. We had histrionics in here earlier in the day from Senator Ronaldson about the flood levy. He was jumping up and down and getting all theatrical. I am not quite sure which school of theatrics the opposition members come from. It was money that was probably not completely wasted, but in some situations they make too much of a fuss too often. They oppose everything that we put up. They are not interested in anything of significance. They do not support the flood levy. What they are saying to the people of Queensland is, ‘We don’t really care; we’re not willing give up 80c a week to help you guys rebuild your state.’ It is absolutely abhorrent of the opposition to stand up and make such fatuous claims and try to scaremonger so much. They are trying to frighten the people of Australia. I do not think that it does the opposition any good or that it benefits them in any way—which is of not much concern to me, but it belittles the whole concept behind the flood levy and what it is meant to be doing for the people of Queensland and Australia.</para>

<para>—I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R4508">Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011</inline> with great pleasure. It is a very interesting piece of legislation that we have before us. We in the coalition have every concern and consideration for the people who have been so tragically and devastatingly affected by the floods in Queensland. At the time, our hearts went out to them and continue to do. We will do all that we can to make sure that they have the assistance that they need to rebuild their lives. I want to take the opportunity to also note and acknowledge the very many people who have been affected by floods right across the country since before December right across the summer period. There was a focus on the floods in Queensland, devastating as they were. But there have been an awful lot of lives, families and communities affected by floods across the whole summer right across the country. They have been in our thoughts as well over what have been very difficult times for them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What we have before us is another new tax from the Labor government. It certainly seems that whenever the Prime Minister and the government have a problem they automatically reach for the tax bucket. They put their hands over there in the little bucket and say, ‘What are we going to do?’ I should have called it ‘the ideas bucket’, actually, because there are certainly not many ideas in there. All they have is this one that they fall back on every time. When they ask, ‘What will we do?’ the answer is always a tax.</para>
<para>The point about this is as follows: if the government had any ability to manage the economy properly and if the government had not embarked on years of waste and mismanagement of taxpayers’ money, they would not need to try and get a tax through this parliament to fund the flood reconstruction. It is as simple as that. This government has absolutely no idea how to manage money, so they have gone to the Australian people and said, ‘By the way, we need to have another tax so that we can raise some money to help these people recover from the floods.’ It is ridiculous. We have a budget of more than $350 billion and the Prime Minister is telling us that she does not have the smarts to find enough saving measures to fund the $1.8 billion that this levy is going to raise. Many people would have had greater respect for the Prime Minister’s ability to find the savings measures to fund this. There is a $350 billion budget, and the Prime Minister cannot some savings measures to offset $1.8 billion. But no, that was not in the ideas bucket. The only thing in the ideas bucket was the tax. That $1.8 billion is going to come from the taxpayers of Australia yet again.</para>
<para>When I talk to people out in the community about this proposed measure from the government, there is a feeling somewhere between consternation as to why the government would even bother doing this when they should be able to just find savings measures and an absolute dislike of the fact that this government is going to put yet another tax on the Australian people. One of the things that people raise in these conversations is the effect that this is going to have on those Australian people right across this country who have already been so generous by reaching deeply into their pockets to donate to this cause, these people, these families and these communities that have been so devastatingly affected. In the true spirit of Australia, they have already donated.</para>
<para>Now what do they see? They see the Prime Minister turning around and saying, ‘We won’t worry about the fact that all of these very kind and generous people have donated; we’re going to tax them anyway.’ People out there in the community are quite rightly saying: ‘I tried to do the right thing; I wanted to do the right thing. I didn’t have a lot of money spare, but I wanted to contribute. I wanted to say to these people that I personally wanted to help. Now I find out that the Prime Minister is going to tax me as well.’ It is no surprise, no wonder, that those people out in our communities—and I know that my good colleague Senator ‘Wacca’ Williams has been talking to a lot of these people out in his community—are just astounded at this government. Not only are they double-dipping, they are showing beyond a shadow of a doubt that Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, does not have the nous, the expertise or the willingness to try and find some saving measures to offset the rebuilding costs.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1) (a)">
<para>(b) and (c) The majority of royalties are negotiated in a commercial context and are paid to the owner of the asset in return for its use. Where the Crown owns the asset (minerals for example), those royalties have a statutory basis and are paid to the Crown.</para>
<para>Like other individuals, corporations and groups who have an interest in land, Indigenous people, corporations and groups negotiate royalty payments in return for certain rights including access to and use of their land. They are negotiated on behalf of the relevant interest holder, which may not be the broader Indigenous community. These negotiations are commercial in nature and the amounts negotiated are, in general, not publically known but treated by the parties as commercial in confidence. It is therefore not possible to comment on the make up of communities receiving royalty payments.</para>
<para>The one exception to this is in the Northern Territory where, under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (the ALRA), when statutory royalties are paid by industry parties to the Northern Territory and Australian Governments in return for mining on Aboriginal land, an equivalent amount is paid into the Aboriginals Benefit Account. The distribution of those funds is governed by Section 64 of the ALRA.</para>
<para>While inquiries could be made of the Australian Tax Office, it is inevitable that any response would result in an incomplete picture as many of the royalty receiving entities are not assessable for income tax purposes.</para>
<para>The commercial-in-confidence nature of most royalty negotiations and payments means the Department cannot answer the Senator’s question in any detail.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>There is generally no applicable power to conduct an audit or review of privately held funds. For further details see the answers to (1) and (3).</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The oversight arrangements that apply to entities that receive royalty payments made to Indigenous individuals, corporations and groups depend on the nature of the entity. This may include any or all of the requirements set out in trust law and specific requirements in the trust deed, and the relevant corporations law (including oversight by the Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations and/or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission). The usual range of equitable and legal remedies are available for affected parties to pursue depending on their circumstances.</para>

<para>The former Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts received advice from the Department and comment from the Australian Heritage Council, both indicating that the New Acton Nishi development would be likely to have a significant impact on the National Heritage values of the Australian Academy of Science building. The Minister also received information in the referral provided by the proponent, which included documents prepared by the proponent’s heritage advisers. Consistent with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), the Minister also considered public comments received in relation to the referral of the development. The Minister considered all of the information provided and came to the view that the development was not likely to have a significant impact on the National Heritage values of the Australian Academy of Science Building. (b) The Minister’s Statement of Reasons for his decision is at Attachment A.</para>

<para>The Australian Heritage Council Act 2003 requires members of the Council to have substantial experience or expertise concerning heritage. The members of the Council meet those criteria.

<para>—The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The Minister strongly supports the EPBC Act provisions for ensuring the public is informed throughout the environmental assessment process. The Olympic Dam expansion is being assessed by environmental impact statement under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The draft environmental impact statement, of almost 1000 pages and several thousand pages of appendices, was released for public comment from 1 May 2009 until 7 August 2009. Under the EPBC Act, BHP Billiton is required to respond to the 4,179 submissions received along with the detailed comments provided by the federal and state governments. This process is currently being concluded. The final environmental impact statement will be published and made publicly available in hard copy and on the internet.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>and (d) The proposed action being assessed by the Australian Government relates to expansion of the Olympic Dam copper, uranium, gold and silver mine, processing plant and associated infrastructure, as described in the referral received under the EPBC Act on 16 August 2005, and as varied on 24 October 2008 and 9 June 2010.</para>
<para>In relation to copper production, the varied EPBC Act referral from BHP Billiton notes that the current proposed approximate production rate for the expanded operation (open cut and existing underground mine) is 750,000 tonnes per annum of refined copper equivalent. However, the assessment under the EPBC Act relates to the likely impacts on matters of national environmental significance of the referred action, rather than to a specific rate of mine production.  It would therefore not be appropriate to limit the assessment or decision on the basis of a specific rate of mine production.</para>
<para>The ramifications of the current proposal have been described in the draft environmental impact statement, released by BHP Billiton in 2009 under the EPBC Act. The final environmental impact statement has now been submitted to governments and will be published once it is accepted by state and federal governments.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Human Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Medicare Australia is responsible for administering the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) program and undertakes compliance activities to ensure the integrity of payments made under the program. However, stockpiling of PBS medicines is not an illegal activity and there is no legislative restriction to stockpiling by patients.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>While Medicare Australia may become aware of stockpiling activities in the course of undertaking compliance activities, stockpiling is not a compliance matter and is not investigated or tracked by Medicare Australia. Compliance concerns only arise where pharmaceutical medicines are passed on to other patients, resold or remanufactured, or sent overseas. Medicare Australia has identified one case of stockpiling this financial year to date in the course of undertaking other compliance activities. No compliance action was taken in relation to the stockpiling as it is not illegal.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Medicare Australia addresses concerns associated with PBS medicines a number of ways. Medicare Australia’s Overseas Drug Diversion (ODD) program aims to detect PBS medicines taken out of the country illegally. Medicare Australia works closely with Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Federal Police in the course of conducting ODD program activities.</para>
<para>The Prescription Shopping Program (PSP) also relates to the supply of PBS medicines. The PSP offers an information service for prescribers if they suspect a patient is obtaining PBS medicines in excess of medical need. Medicare Australia also proactively contacts a prescribers and patients where they are identified under the PSP criteria. The PSP is designed to assist prescribers in making prescribing decisions. It is not illegal to seek PBS medications in excess of clinical need.</para>
<para>As outlined in our National Compliance Program 2010–11, Medicare Australia will be reviewing pharmacies with a high proportion of patients who appear to be stockpiling PBS medicines with a view to identifying potentially fraudulent claims and other compliance issues.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Data is not collected on the number of hospital admissions or re-admissions that occur as a result of patients using out of date medicines.</para>
<para>Usage of out of date medicines in the community is minimised through initiatives such as the Safety Net 20 Day Rule, the Return Unwanted Medicines project and various National Prescribing Service (NPS) consumer Quality Use of Medicines activities.</para>
<para>The Safety Net 20 Day Rule discourages people from obtaining supplies of medicines earlier than they are needed and this reduces stockpiling of medicines. Under the Safety Net 20 Day Rule, for certain PBS medicines, a resupply within 20 days of a previous supply of the same medicine, will fall outside Safety Net entitlements.</para>
<para>The Return Unwanted Medicines project is a national scheme that enables consumers to return unwanted or out of date medicines to any community pharmacy in Australia, for disposal in an environmentally friendly manner, reducing the risk of medication misadventure.</para>
<para>The NPS was established in 1998 as an organisation independent of Government and industry, to provide medicines information and resources for health practitioners and consumers in improving quality use of medicines.</para>
<para>The NPS provides activities targeted specifically at consumers, including public awareness campaigns, the NPS Medicines Name Finder and the Medimate brochure which provides information about using medicines.</para>
<para>A new mass media campaign that focuses on why Australians need to pay more attention to their medicines was recently launched on 30 January 2011 on Network 7. The Be Medicinewise campaign has been developed by the NPS to provide medicine information to health professionals and consumers. Over the next four months the campaign will address what it means to be medicinewise and why it is important and provide information, resources and tips to help consumers navigate their medicines decisions and make better choices with regard to their health.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>There is not yet a scientific methodology to compare the extent of migration between years. However, based on anecdotal evidence from long-term and experienced park staff and other residents, 2010 was considered to be a reasonably large migration when compared with recent years.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Parks Australia relies on historical records of red crab movements to determine which roads will be most significantly affected.</para>
<para>We have installed infrastructure (crab bridges, underpasses and fencing) along some roads within the park and adjoining the park where crabs have historically migrated in high numbers. These crab crossings allow the crabs to be channelled under or over the roads. Roads in the park that do not have this infrastructure but also have high numbers of red crabs crossing them are closed during the migration.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>All roads within Christmas Island National Park likely to have large numbers of red crabs migrating across them were considered for closure. These included Murray Road, The Blowholes; The Dales; the Pink House Track; Margaret Knoll Road; and the Circuit Tracks.</para>
<para>Parks Australia worked closely with the Shire of Christmas Island, Regional Australia and the Australian Federal Police to review the likely closure of roads in key migration areas outside the park boundary. They included the Cove Car Park Road, Ethel Beach Road and Greta Beach Road.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Within Christmas Island National Park, all roads with large numbers of red crabs migrating across them were closed during the migration. These were Murray Road, The Blowholes; The Dales; Pink House Track; Margaret Knoll Road; and the Circuit Tracks. Non-park roads closed in collaboration with the Shire included the Cove Car Park Road, Ethel Beach Road and Greta Beach Road. The length of closures varied according to the migration. Murray Road was closed at various intervals over the longest period, from 18 October to 20 December.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>A determination was published in the local paper, The Islander, warning the public of forthcoming road closures. From September until the 2010 migration, Parks Australia also regularly emailed key stakeholders and published information in The Islander. The information covered details of the migration cycle, how drivers could minimise crab mortality rates and the need for road closures.</para>
<para>It is not possible to announce the precise dates of road closures in advance. The migration depends on the moon cycle and the rains. Crabs begin migrating when wet season rains start, but the exact timing - and even the month - of the wet season changes each year.</para>
<para>Roads are closed on an ‘as needs’ basis on short notice as the migration commences, so there is often no or very short notice to the public.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>Some crabs commenced their migration by mid-October. However there is no specific migration commencement date as not all begin their migration at the same time. By early to mid-November 2010, most migrating crabs had commenced their migration.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>There is no specific migration cease date. The last major spawn date was 2 December. After the spawning the female crabs returned from the coast to upland areas on the island over a two week period. All roads were open by 20 December.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Parks Australia is authorised to close roads within Christmas Island National Park on an as needs basis during the migration.</para>
<para>Roads outside the park boundary are managed by the Shire of Christmas Island and/or Regional Australia. Parks Australia works in collaboration with the Shire to manage these roads, but does not have the legal power to close them.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>There is no scientific program to monitor red crab mortality rates. Park staff estimate crab mortality at more than 500,000 over the last few months.</para>
</item>
<item label="(10)">
<para>Yes.</para>
</item>
<item label="(11)">
<para>The road was not fully closed during the migration. Parks Australia actively managed traffic during periods of high crab activity in the early morning and late afternoon from mid-November to early December. Park staff controlled traffic, with the support of the Shire, by escorting convoys of cars to and from the resort on an hourly basis.</para>
</item>
<item label="(12)">
<para>This section of the road is not within the boundary of the national park. As it is not part of a Commonwealth reserve the Director of National Parks has no authority to close the road. As noted in response to Q11, Parks Australia actively managed traffic on this road to reduce red crab mortality rates, with the approval and support of the Shire of Christmas Island which is responsible for the road. Other measures included raising community awareness, and encouraging drivers to reduce their speed and to car pool to reduce vehicle numbers on these roads.</para>
</item>
<item label="(13)">
<para>Parks Australia cannot legally close this road.</para>
</item>
<item label="(14)">
<para>There were no submissions made to Parks Australia for the road to remain open.</para>
</item>
<item label="(15)">
<para>As noted above no submissions were made for the road to remain open. Parks Australia is not able to close the road under r12.42(3), as the road is not within Christmas Island National Park.</para>
</item>
<item label="(16)">
<para>Park staff estimate crab mortality in this area was in the order of 400,000 crabs. However this estimate is not based on a scientific monitoring program.</para>
</item>
<item label="(17)">
<para>The migration is significant across the whole island. Major migration areas are along the north coast of the island, the Blowholes area, the Dales and the north- east coast (Greta Beach, Ethel Beach, Resort Road).</para>

<item label="(18)">
<para>No.</para>

<para>The migration is significant across the whole island. Major migration areas include the north coast of the island, the Blowholes area, the Dales and the north- east coast (Greta Beach, Ethel Beach, Resort Road). Arrows on the attached map show these locations.</para>
</item>
<item label="(20)">
<para>As noted in Q3,4,8 and 12, Parks Australia can only close roads within the national park. Under sub-regulation 12.42(3), the Margaret Knoll road, on the eastern side of Christmas Island within the national park boundary was closed at periods of high crab activity.</para>
<para>The North South Baseline road, which adjoins the park, was not closed because it has infrastructure to channel crabs under the road.</para>
</item>
<item label="(21)">
<para>The data from the last island-wide survey is currently being statistically analysed and the results are not yet available.</para>
</item>
<item label="(22)">
<para>There are various published estimates of red crab numbers but Parks Australia is not aware of the figure of 15 million. At least one estimate of over 100 million red crabs was made in the 1990s but it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the methodology and data used to produce this number. More recently, estimates have been made of red crab numbers based on burrow counts from the biennial island-wide surveys which commenced in 2001, but this data is currently being reanalysed to ensure that statistically rigorous population estimates can be calculated.</para>
