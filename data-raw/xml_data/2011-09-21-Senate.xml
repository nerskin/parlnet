              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill gives effect to proposals, developed by an Industry Working Party, to reform the portable long service leave arrangements in the black coal mining industry.  The Industry Working Party comprised of representatives from the NSW Minerals Council Limited, the Queensland Resources Council, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union – Mining and Energy Division, the Electrical Trades Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers Australia, the NSW Colliery Officials Association and the Mine Managers Association of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the industry participants on their collaborative approach and their commitment to the future success of the unique black coal mining industry long service leave scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will amend the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992, the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992, the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Amendment Act 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Employees in the black coal mining industry have accessed portable long service leave entitlements under the terms of Federal Awards since 1949 which in turn were funded by an excise on coal production. Since 1993 the funding of entitlements has been through an employer levy scheme and administered by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation. Employers are reimbursed when they have made a payment to an eligible employee in respect of their entitlement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A priority concern of the Industry Working Party was to ensure that the long service leave entitlement applied universally in the black coal mining industry.  Amendments were made in 2009 to address this concern.  Schedule 2 of the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Act 2009  extended the preserved award-based long service leave entitlements to all the eligible employees who did not otherwise have an award-derived long service leave entitlement from 1 January 2010.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While the 2009 amendments addressed the priority concerns of the Industry Working Party this Bill seeks to further the 2009 reforms by providing for the remaining proposals of the Industry Working Party.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill legislates the minimum long service leave entitlement for all eligible employees in the black coal mining industry based on the precursor award entitlement.  Provision is made for all eligible employees, whether full-time, part-time or casual, to accrue long service leave in the black coal mining industry.  An eligible employee will be entitled to long service leave when they have completed a period, or periods, of qualifying service totalling 8 years or more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A key imperative of the Industry Working Party proposals was to improve the operation of the scheme so that the amounts that employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund in respect of long service leave payments more closely correspond to the amounts that they have paid into the <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="&#xD;&#xA;            #fund">Fund</a> by way of levy.  The Bill therefore changes the basis on which levy is imposed and facilitates changes to the employer reimbursement arrangements.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides for a greater compliance role for the Corporation.  The Corporation will have the power to require persons to produce information or documents and standing to pursue alleged contraventions of a civil penalty provision on behalf of the Commonwealth.  Additional penalty provisions have been included and existing penalty levels have been increased in line with contemporary standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes changes to the structure and representation of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to better reflect the current industry representative status of certain employee-representative and employer-representative groups, and to increase the terms of directors from 2 to 4 years.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also establishes a regime for transition from the award-derived long service leave scheme (preserved under section 113 of the Fair Work Act 2009 in respect of award employees and extended to non-award employees by Schedule 2 of the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Act 2009) to the new statutory long service leave scheme established by this Bill.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government is happy to facilitate these amendments proposed by the Industry Working Party which will benefit both employers and employees in the black coal mining industry.  </span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill introduces amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 (the Administration Act) for the teenage parent and jobless families trials which were announced in the Building Australia’s Future Workforce package in the 2011-12 Budget.  The trials will be implemented in ten disadvantaged locations across Australia. The Bill will be accompanied by a legislative instrument which will outline limited circumstances where a Parenting Payment recipient with a youngest child aged less than six years can be required to attend interviews and develop a participation plan with the Department of Human Services.  For teenage parent trial participants, parents can also be required to do the activities set out in the participation plan. Trial participants who do not meet these new requirements can have their income support payment suspended until they comply. Once they comply their payment will be re-instated and they will receive full back-pay. Family Tax Benefit will continue to be paid even where income support is suspended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Joblessness among families is a significant social and economic problem in Australia and Australia has one of the highest proportion of children living in jobless families in the OECD. There are currently some 257,000 jobless families with dependent children who are on income support and who have no reported income over the last year or more. Being in a jobless family where no adult has a job for a significant period of time is associated with higher rates of poverty, poorer health status and lower education attainment for both parents and their children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are around 11,000 teenage parents on Parenting Payment in Australia. Over 90 per cent of these parents do not have Year 12 education and over a quarter only have primary school as their highest level of attained education. There are some teenage parents who do very well for themselves and their children.  However there is also clear evidence that becoming a teenage parent carries with it a greater risk of poor life outcomes for both parents and children.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These trials provide new services, opportunities and responsibilities to boost the educational attainment and job readiness of the parents, and to increase the wellbeing and development of young children. Improved family functioning is an expected outcome of the trials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, a parent on Parenting Payment who has a youngest child reach six years of age, must look for a job of at least 15 hours per week. If parents don’t do this, or if they don’t accept a suitable job that is offered to them, they can lose their income support for a period of time. But for parents on Parenting Payment with children younger than six years old, there are currently no participation requirements.  As at the end of June 2011, there were some 323,000 parents on Parenting Payment with no participation requirements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the important role that this group of parents plays in caring for their young children. But there are often many services in their local community that they could be using while they are parenting – many of which are free of charge - to improve their family’s life outcomes. This includes playgroups, preschool, TAFE courses, going back to school, attending baby health clinics and joining life skills programs such as cooking classes and financial management classes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is by making use of these services while their children are young that parents on welfare can improve their chances of being financially independent once their children are at school. Making use of these services also means their children are more likely to be school ready when they turn six years old. Making use of these services helps empower parents because they are exercising their right to use local community resources from which they can sometimes feel excluded. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By introducing requirements for teenage parent trial participants which mean they must access local services and attend activities, the Government is sending a clear message that it is the responsibility of the parent to make the most of opportunities available to them. The trial participants will be teenage parents in the ten locations who do not have Year 12 or equivalent, who have children who are not yet 6 years old, and who are in receipt of Parenting Payment. There will be some 4,000 teen parents in total participating in the trial. Teen parents must seek to attain Year 12 or equivalent via their participation in the trial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Each of the trial locations will have specially tailored opportunities for teen parents to re-engage with education, including options for studying without having to put children into child care. There will be people who can help teenage parents to navigate the variety of services available, including for example, helping them enrol in a course or go along to an activity for the first time. The Government has invested in extra services (such as Youth Connections and Communities for Children) in the trial locations to make sure parents get the help they need to participate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To parents in the jobless families trial (all of whom have either been on income support for at least two years or who are under the age of 23 and all of whom are not presently working nor studying while on income support and who have children who are not yet 6 years old), the Government is sending a very clear message that attending Centrelink interviews and workshops and developing a participation plan are important steps towards being work ready once children start school. There will be some 22,000 parents a year participating in the jobless families trial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will make necessary changes to the social security law so that parents subject to the new requirements do not lose entitlement to other non-participation payments (such as Family Tax Benefit) due to failure to comply with the new requirements. Parents in the trials will not be subject to the jobseeker compliance framework.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It should be emphasised that parents who are particularly vulnerable will be assessed by Centrelink and offered more intensive support via Case Coordination. This new approach helps Centrelink better identify a parents needs and allows them to provide more appropriate referrals and better services at the time they are needed most. This support may also extend to exempting the parent from certain aspects of the trial for a period of time. The trials will be closely monitored to ensure they are effective and fair. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion today, should it be successful, sets in place the way in which the Senate will handle the package of clean energy legisla­tion in November this year. It is important to pass this motion today for the benefit of senators, their staff and parliamentary staff to have clarity about when we will sit in Nove­mber to deal with the Clean Energy Bill. I do not intend to spend a great deal of time in setting out the issues that are substantive to this motion but rather to provide the Senate with the opportunity to be forewarned of the hours that we will sit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could of course list the various acts that the opposition, when they were in govern­ment, dealt with and the way that they managed the chamber, but I do not intend to take us to the detail of those issues. I could contrast that with the moderate, measured way that the government has managed the chamber in the past 3½ years, the generous time the government has provided the oppo­sition for dealing with issues in the Senate and, of course, the way that the government has set out this motion to provide for the hours of debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition's record of managing the chamber when in government—if I could just take us there fractionally—speaks for itself, particularly during the fourth term of the Howard government when the now oppo­sition had a majority in this place. They used their numbers to gag debate almost routinely. Over 30 bills were debated under guillotine during the Howard government's fourth term. The opposition are in no position to condemn this motion today when they look at their record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that, when a government has a majority and can exercise it, it should do so with principles in mind, it should do so courteously and it should allow sufficient debate so that people can contribute to the debate and it does not end up in what would be described as a filibuster. In terms of managing the legislative program, it is important that the program does proceed. We have an important group of bills to pass through the Senate and it is the intention of the government, with the support of the Greens, to pass this legislation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key question is whether guillotine motions are arbitrary and restrict debate or whether they actually permit the chamber to devote a decent amount of time for constru­ctive debate of the legislation. On occasions a constructive allocation of time for a motion can ensure that the chamber operates so as to manage its business and to effectively review legislation rather than be captured by political grandstanding and filibustering that drags out the debate on the legislation. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is the right motion to ensure that we can move through both the second reading and the committee stage of these bills in the time allocated, which is set out in the motion. It provides for a reasonable time for debate, and it is, as I have indicated, an important package of bills that the govern­ment is seeking to pass in the time allocated in the motion itself. The Senate of course does need to consider this legislation, but it does not have to do so in an exhaustive way, and where everyone is exhausted, with ad hoc additional hours. What we have done in this motion is set out reasonable hours to ensure that people do not become exhausted. But we do need to ensure that, as we have set forward, these bills are passed by 21 Novem­ber. I also foreshadowed that the government will be seeking to pass the Steel Transforma­tion Plan Bill and the bill establishing the Australian Renewable Energy Agency by 21 November 2011. That means that on 21 November there will be two further bills on which we will seek the opposition's agree­ment to debate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The clean energy package that the govern­ment will shortly bring to this chamber will conclude the first of a significant phase of the parliament's response to climate change. Parliament has spent untold time and energy on this issue. The parliament first considered the issue in 1994, almost 17 years ago. Since then, there have been no fewer than 35 parliamentary inquiries—36 if we add the current Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation looking at this package of bills. Exhaustive policy work has been undertaken on this issue. The Howard government itself was responsible for much of this work and adopted the conclusion of the work undertaken: a price on carbon was opposition policy until almost two years ago. This legislation will deliver a carbon pricing mechanism.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion for the variation of hours seeks to set reasonable parameters for the debate on the clean energy legislation in the Senate, with four additional sitting days in November and additional hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Senate will have a fortnight for the debate of the package. So, ostensibly, the first week will allow for speeches in the second reading debate to continue and the second week will be for the committee stage and any amendments fores­hadowed. By allowing a reasonable alloca­tion of time for debate on this package, this motion will allow at least 20 hours of debate in each of the two weeks—</span>

                  </a>  If I can be bold enough to assume that the opposition will allow the debate to progress without endless procedural motions or interruptions, then the time available will be theirs to spend on the second reading and committee stages. The opposition can of course choose to add to that time through MPI debates and other opportunities that are available, or they can spend the additional time—particularly the four sitting days added to the program—actually debating the substantive matters of the bill. The government is not seeking to curtail question time, notices, the adjourn­ment debate or private senator's business; all of that remains for the opposition to use effectively. The motion does remove general business for those two weeks, but this is to ensure that we can conclude the debate by 21 November, with the bulk of the debate taking place in the first two sitting weeks of November. This motion will allow relatively normal parliamentary sitting weeks, as I have indicated, with considerable time for the second reading and committee stages of the legislation package.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government anticipate that the oppo­sition will use this time to debate construct­ively, to review the legislation, despite their clear position of being opposed to the legislation. Their position is of course on the record. I would encourage them not to take the time to filibuster during this debate but to constructively use the time available to debate the substantive issues contained within the two bills. In fact, they could demonstrate that this morning by supporting the passage of this motion so that we can ensure that those two weeks are available. I am not so sure the opposition are going to do that; I suspect they are going to oppose it and I suspect they will continue to debate this for some time. However, we are keen to ensure that we do get on with parliamentary business and that we do not spent intermin­able time in filibustering, stretching out the debate, when we have important legislation to conclude this week as well.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I remind the Senate of the context of this debate. This package is the culmination of an extraordinary amount of work over the past 17 years. In the past three years, there have been numerous committee inquiries into the issue, with one joint committee inquiry completed this year; exposure drafts of the legislation from that inquiry; and, finally, the joint select commit­tee inquiry due to report next week. The issue has been considered at length. It is now time for this package of bills to be debated. This motion for the variation of hours will put in place the appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the opposition have sufficient time to proceed with the debate, and I hope they engage in that process and contribute constructively to the debate. I seek the support of the chamber for this motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  The coalition oppose the motion which seeks to extend the hours of the Senate. The reason we do that is that the Senate is currently being confronted with an unseemly rush to get a package of legislation through this chamber, a package of legislation that is built on deceit. The Labor government went to the last election saying 'there will be no carbon tax'—and, but for this package of legislation, there would be no need for these extended hours. It is amazing, isn't it, how the Labor Party are able to dress up their deceit of the Australian people? They call this the 'clean energy' package. It should be called the 'dirty hands' package, because that is exactly what it is. It is based on their deception of the Australian people, whereby Ms Gillard said about a week before the election, when the polls were neck and neck, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Either she deceived the Australian people or she has to accept that which a lot of Australians now suspect—that she in fact is not leading this government but Senator Bob Brown and the Australian Greens are. No matter how Senator Ludwig, Labor and the Greens try to dress up this clean energy package, it is a dirty package and it is a deceitful package. There is no doubt that, if Ms Gillard had said to the Australian people six days before the last election, 'There will be a carbon tax,' she would not be Prime Minister today and Mr Abbott would be the Prime Minister of a majority coalition government. No matter how much they seek to dress up the morality and the importance of this package—even calling it a clean package when it is conceiv­ed and built in deceit—the Australian people know what this is about. It is about rushing through a deceit on the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a package of some one-and-a-half dozen bills. Labor boast that this is going to be the biggest change to the Australian economy ever. Let us just assume for the moment that their boast is right. If their boast is right, how is it that the only parliamentary examination of this package of bills is to be the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation that was set up where Labor and the Greens ruthlessly used their numbers to get the chairmanship and the deputy chairmanship, completely and utterly against normal parliamentary proced­ure. That is how desperate they are to ensure that there is no proper examination of this legislation. This committee—which has to report, if I recall correctly, by 5 October, within 19 days—will be one of the most truncated committees ever for a package of this size. The committee is starting the hearings today. Guess who its first witnesses are? The department of the Treasury. Has Treasury finished its modelling? We as a coalition asked that question yesterday of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. She refused to answer. When a point of order was taken as to relevance about the very specific question, 'Has the modelling been finished?' she again refused. The committee today will be discussing with Treasury the impact of this legislation in the absence of the Treasury modelling having been made available to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Senator Ludwig says how gracious the government are in giving us all this time. If they were genuine, they would be giving us the Treasury modelling. Why do we need new Treasury modelling? Because the first lot of modelling was based on $20 a tonne and we now know it was the Greens that foisted $23 a tonne on this hapless and hopeless government. This is a government that cannot get a trick. I do not know what it is about them but they have this unique capacity to come out with big headlines with everything else turning to custard under­neath. Remember cash for clunkers, pink batts, Building the Education Revolution, green loans, solar panels, the East Timor solution and the Malaysian solution. No matter what area of government endeavour you look at, this is a government that is highlighted by one word—incompetence. With this package of legislation they add another word, and that is deceit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are being asked to support legisla­tion—and support the rushing through of legislation—of an incompetent government which has based its mandate and this legislation on deceit of the Australian people. Why the rush? Why does the legislation have to be passed, as this motion would suggest, by 21 November? In fact, the parliament is scheduled to sit for a week after that, so why can it not be finished at least at the end of the current proposed parliamentary timetable? Why does it have to be truncated before the parliament rises?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the government and the Australian people: why would you seek to impose a carbon tax—the highest, the heaviest and the most damaging carbon tax anywhere in the world—at a time when the International Monetary Fund is telling us to be prepared for a double-dip recession, at a time when the economy especially in Europe and the United States is not flash and at a time when we should be fastening our seatbelts for another economic crisis? When they are warning us that commodity prices may well start tanking very shortly, here is this government hell-bent on imposing not only a carbon tax but also a mining tax just to make sure that if one does not kill off the Austra­lian economy the two combined will hope­fully have that effect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why this rush? It is amazing how history repeats itself with this Labor government and they cannot learn from their past mistakes. This is a government that sought to go to Copenhagen with legislation, and we remem­ber that. We would have been the clowns of Copenhagen. We would have been seen as the fools of the world, going to Copenhagen with a legislated Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme when not a single other country in the world was going to do that. Not content with or learning from that failure, Labor are now desperate to get Australia to go to Durban so we can be the dunces of Durban and wave legislation around and say, 'How clever are we: we have legislated a scheme which is going to destroy Australian jobs, destroy the Australian economy and do nothing for the world environment to boot.' We know that to be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question the government have to answer is: why is there this indecent haste on a policy that they promised the Australian people they would not implement? Indeed, the Australian people are quite right to ask how it is—especially in the House of Repre­sentatives where every single Labor and coalition member was elected on a promise of no carbon tax—that in all likelihood a majority of House of Representatives memb­ers are now going to vote for a carbon tax. How is it that this Greens tail can wag the Labor dog? The reason is that there is no spine in the dog. Ms Gillard, when confront­ed with the spoils of office, was willing to forego any promises she had made to the Australian people. She was willing to trade anything to remain Prime Minister. I do not care what she trades in a personal capacity but I do mind, and the coalition minds, when she trades Australia's future in doing so—and that is what she has done. She will be recorded in history as having done so and will be judged very harshly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind Senator Ludwig and those who are genuinely interested of the need to ventilate issues. The Labor Party were always against tax reform and the goods and services tax. We accepted that, but that change, that reform to the Australian economy, spent five months in this chamber and was scrutinised by four specialist com­mittees—five months; four specialist committees. Labor and the Greens—wait for it—will not allow a single Senate committee to have a look at this legislation. They will say, 'We have this joint committee,' but it will have to report within 19 days—not five months—and at this stage it does not even have the new Treasury modelling. How can the committee do its work without the Treasury modelling? It is a joke and it is treating the Australian parliament and the committee with contempt—other than those committee members who are part and parcel of and conniving with that contempt, such as the deputy chair, Senator Milne, who is willing to be part and parcel of this deception of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Gillard went to the last election promising there would be no carbon tax. She then said she wanted to build a consensus about putting a price on carbon. I congrat­ulate her; she has achieved a consensus. The consensus is against a price on carbon. The consensus is against a carbon tax. Yet she is wilfully flouting the will of the Australian people and she is willingly flouting her own solemn promise to the Australian people—the promise that she solemnly made, staring down the camera, speaking to the Australian people, saying that there would be no carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I go around the country, electorate to electorate, little newspaper to little newspaper—regional papers—the Labor Party are always telling us how important the carbon tax is. What they never tell us is why they went to the last election on a no-carbon-tax promise. They do not apologise to their electorates and they do not explain to their electorates why they changed their minds—they just hope they can airbrush it out. When confronted, they cannot provide a single answer other than that the Australian Greens foisted the carbon tax upon them. That is the shame of the Australian Labor Party. I am sure that the Labor Party of the Ben Chifleys and the John Curtins of this world would never have countenanced the sort of hectoring and bullying and blackmail which this government is willing to submit itself to from the Australian Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is good to see a genuine labour representative in this place like Senator Madigan from the DLP. At least he understands the impact this carbon tax is going to have on the workers of Australia and on the businesses of Australia. He also understands that it will make not one iota of difference to the world's environment. I would invite any Labor speaker or indeed any Greens speaker in this debate to tell us how much world temperatures will go down if we legislate this carbon tax. Can they tell us how much less sea levels will rise if we legislate this carbon tax? Whenever I am in a debate with a Labor or Greens member or senator, I continually ask that question and they can never give a response. What is the reason? Because they know it will make no difference. This is all about a huge cash grab by a desperate Treasurer and a desperate government wanting to do the right thing by the Greens and trying to scramble together enough money to make their budget balance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it not bizarre that overnight another Labor Treasurer who has been unable ever to deliver a surplus gets, as did Lehman Broth­ers and Paul Keating, some gong for eco­nomic management while great Australian Treasurers, such as Peter Costello, never got one? It really does make one wonder how these international organisations operate when Lehman Brothers get an award—and, my goodness, they have a lot to answer for—and Paul Keating, the man who got us into all the debt that the coalition had to clear up, gets a gong and now Mr Swan gets a gong. I think it is a perfect trifecta. Mr Costello should be very happy that he was never given a gong, because he would be in very uncomfortable company if he were to have got one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I digress. The simple fact is this: this package of bills, this dirty package, is based on deceit. The Labor Party know it. It is not based on good economics, it is not based on good social policy and it is not based on good environmental policy. I see Senator Brown in the chamber, a man who is able to make great prognostications about the future of our nation. I still remember 1981, when there was a proposal for a clean energy power generation scheme in Tasmania. Senator Brown led the charge against it. Do you know what his proposal was as an alternative power supply? The building of a coal fired power station. That was his proposal when Director of the Wilderness Society of Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good thing is, when people stay around for a while you can ask what were their predictions 30 years ago; what was their public policy proposal 30 years ago. We would have had a coal fired power station in Tasmania belching out CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions if Senator Brown, then Director of the Wilder­ness Society, had had his way. Of course Senator Brown in this debate will make all sorts of predictions about the future, about what is going to happen if we do not pass this legislation, but I just remind people of some of the other predictions that Senator Brown and the Greens have made that simply have not come to pass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government beholden to the Greens. It will do whatever the Greens require of it. I know that there are many Labor people who do not want to vote for this package of bills. They know it is destructive. They know it is going to devastate the Australian economy in the absence of world action. We as a coalition say you can change and show leadership in a sensible manner through a direct action plan without mugging your economy and without mugging Australian jobs. Yet Labor, having promised no carbon tax, are now seeking to rush one through this chamber—and of course inflict it on us so that they can go to Durban as some sort of heroes. They will go to Durban as the dunces of the world, having legislated a dirty package that will destroy jobs, destroy the wealth of our nation and do nothing for the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask again, how can the government assert it is giving us enough time on this debate while it is withholding fundamental Treasury modelling? As the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future meets today, that modelling will not be available. When we ask questions about the impact, day after day after day on behalf of this government Senator Wong simply refuses to answer the questions that do need to be answered. Can I simply say to Labor: you might be able to get away with it in the chamber in 2011 but you will not be able to get away with it when the Australian people cast their verdict on you. You cannot make a solemn promise to the Australian people and then simply discarded it like a soiled tissue as being of no consequence. This is a matter of the most serious nature. The Australian people do not want this carbon tax, they do not want this government, and we as a coalition will fight this all the way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I say at the outset that the Greens will be supporting this motion for due process and for an orderly debate on the carbon price package for this nation. This goes way beyond what the coalition in office allowed this chamber when discussing, for example, the second tranche of the sale of Telstra, where we had a guillotine brought in, a very truncated debate, a one-day committee and, bang, through it went.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BOB BROWN:</span>
                  </a>  The opposition member is saying that the Greens are better than the Liberal Party, and I have to accept that interjection—I agree. It is amazing that the coalition, these conservative upholders of the good, although they have been listened to in silence, are interjecting now that I have got to my feet. I am always fascinated by their bad behaviour when they are losing an argument.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I might plagiarise Oscar Wilde, if there is one thing better than Senator Abetz refusing to talk to you, it is when he talks you up. When he became minister for forests under the Howard government his first statement that very day was that he would not talk to me as a Greens senator about forests in Tasmania. I guess that was a mixed blessing as far as I was concerned. Here we have him in the chamber today talking up me and the Greens as being the nation's strongest political advocates for action on climate change. I thank him for that. It is only fair and proper that I do. By the way, he made reference to the Treasurer, Mr Swan, getting a gong overnight for the state of the Australian economy and its ability to ride through the recent global downturn. I want to congratulate the Treasurer for that accolade. It is a high accolade for him and the government and for Australia, and it should be recognised as such. This award does this nation good, and the Treasurer is to be commended for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have in prospect an orderly process for the debate on this worthy carbon package—but a package which is way short of where the Greens think we should be taking Australia as a leader in climate change action around the world. This worthy legislation deserves to pass this parliament and to pass it this year. The government has brought forward an orderly process in this motion. The Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future is sitting now with cross-party representation looking at the legislation and taking further advice from business, from the unions, from non-government organisations and from the community at large. It will report back to the parliament and when we get toward the end of the parliamentary year we will have a process for two weeks of debate in the Senate of this extraordinarily important legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation has been the subject of almost unprecedented public debate, media scrutiny and input from right across the nation and, when I look at the polls, has huge support from the 1.5 million people who voted Greens at the last election. I commend the government, the Prime Minister and, indeed, the Independents in the House of Representatives—Mr Windsor and Mr Oake­shott—for the process and the responsible way in which, a year after a committee was established by this parliament—quite unpre­cedented, cross-party representation, both houses involved—we now have a package of consensus legislation before the parliament which, given all the circumstances, will move the nation forward in taking reasonable action on climate change. It certainly does not have any winner taking all. It is a consensus arrangement and it is one that we are committed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must make reference here to my coll­eague and deputy leader, Senator Christine Milne, who is at that committee at the moment, for her proposal to establish that committee. For the record, I refer also to the Prime Minister because, when I went in to put Senator Milne's proposal, the Prime Minister had by happenstance the same proposal to establish a committee, because the Labor Party and the Greens had different positions. Prime Minister Gillard had the maturity to say, 'We cannot at the outset here come to an agreement. Let's go to the wider Australian public, to business, to the non-government organisations and to the commu­nity as a whole through a committee process. Let's bring in the experts to establish the way forward.' She has been pilloried for a state­ment on no carbon tax made during the election campaign but what is passing strange about that is that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, who in a memorable submission on the <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30 Report </span>said you cannot have faith in words that are not written down—'What I say is not necessarily what I will do'—has advocated what Senator Abetz has just described as a direct action plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is not said there is that this commits the opposition to the same target as the Labor Party, which is a 5 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from Australia over 1990 levels by the year 2020. But the process is very different. If there is one thing to be said about a failure of the media, it is its failure to put the spotlight onto this direct action plan of Senator Abetz and Mr Abbott.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The preliminary figures from Treasury were that that action plan by 2020 would cost Australian households, on average, $720 per household per annum. But the difference between that and the Labor-Green-Independ­ents formula now before this parliament is that not only is it more but also there is no compensation for householders. They would be paying that through the teeth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last couple of weeks, to compound this fact that the opposition intends to pulver­ise the household budget to foster the big polluting industries—because that is where the money from households will go; it is to give the big polluting industries money to clean up their act—Mr Abbott, the honour­able Leader of the Opposition, said that he would not allow international offsets. That means that the big polluting industries, as part of meeting their need to cut greenhouse gas emissions overall, could not in their trading profile go overseas and purchase offsets such as potentially protecting rain forests or, better still, buying into real renewable energy projects elsewhere and so prevent or offset the release of greenhouse gases in other countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By doing that, he is saying that these big polluting industries must find within Australia the totality of such offsets. Treasury has had a look at that prospect and its modelling—and this apparently escaped Senator Abetz because he was after Treasury modelling but this is out in the public arena and he did not want to go there—is now that every household in Australia, on average, by 2020 under the Abbott-Abetz plan would be hit by $1,300 extra in electricity bills and—here is the rub—with no compensation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor-Greens-Independents model gives every household across the spectrum the opportunity for offsets and, on average, that compensation means that households will be compensated for an increase in power costs flowing from action to clean up the environment. Indeed, some low-income earners, including pensioners, get a bonus out of it. They get more money than there will be in projected power price increases down the line. With this is an effort to get householders to use the compensation flow­ing from the money raised under the Labor-Greens-Independents formula off the big polluters to invest themselves in household measures which will save energy and lower their household bills. It is a double win for households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, under the Abetz-Abbott plan, house­holds will be smacked an extra $1,300 per annum by 2020, with no compensation and, therefore, no opportunity to purchase the equipment or get the advice that will help cut their power bills. In fact, they are faced with an inhibition to do that because they will be out of pocket. Where is that money going to go? It will go to the big polluters. So that is the alternative of the Abetz-Abbott oppo­sition, supported by Senator Joyce and the National Party in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have talked about a great big new tax. Well, they are going to have great big new power bills of $1,300, on average, per household by 2020, with no compensation and an inhibition on people to reduce their consumption. Whereas there is a stimulus, an opportunity, through compensation for all households so compensated in Australia to reduce their power and to feel good about that because they are contributing to reduc­ing greenhouse gas emissions in this country, which is the biggest per capita greenhouse gas polluter on the face of the planet, certainly amongst the richer nations. At the same time, of course, they will be better off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a simple dictum here, which you will hear in the upcoming debate. The Abetz-Abbott prescription is to take money from householders and give it to the big polluters. The Gillard government-Greens-Oakeshott-Windsor prescription is to take money from the big polluters, who are very often largely foreign owned and export their profits, and give it to the householders. That is the difference. I am sure the current inquiry that got underway this morning will be able to add greater information to that winning profile for the Australian public that is invested in this legislation, which is having a fair go in terms of public scrutiny and which will have a fair go in terms of two weeks debate here in the Senate before it is finally put through, if the Senate so decides, in time for us by the end of this year to have Australia as one of the leading nations when it comes to action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to the ABC's radio news channel a few days ago, to a BBC question session on Al Gore, the former Vice-President of the United States who has become a champion of action on climate change. What became apparent is that, when you get outside the boxed-in debate within politics in Australia, you can hear from such an eminent figure, who shared in a Nobel Prize for work on climate change, accolades for Australia for now being up there with China and India, which recently put a tax on coal, as leading the world in new action to tackle climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an hour or two I will be talking to the very important conference on tourism and transport, which I think the Prime Minister might be addressing at about now in this parliament. One of the things that will concentrate the minds of the conference is the future of one of the great tourist icons in Australia, the Great Barrier Reef. Senator Abetz may say what he likes but the fact is the science says that with carbon dioxide being absorbed by the ocean and the ocean becoming more acidic, even if you set aside the impact of coral bleaching through warming of the oceans, the Great Barrier Reef is faced with massive damage later this century through acidification, the increasing acid component of the ocean which prevents the corals from replicating. There will be massive damage, and yet we have a coalition—and I am afraid we have to look at Labor on this, which wants to promote greater coal exports out of Australia by the largely foreign owned coal industry, with one of the expenses coming out of that being the threat of massive damage to this great icon of nature on the planet, which is one of the earlier recognised World Heritage components of Australia's magnificent natural heritage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">   According to Queensland government figures, the Great Barrier Reef supports over 60,000 jobs and has a $6 billion annual economy the majority of which, unlike with the coal industry, flows through into the coffers of small business and to the regional economy.</span>

As with every problem that the current government faces, it is somehow the opposition's fault. Failed border protection policy? That is our fault. Falling consumer confidence and falling business confidence? That is our fault. And here today with the parliament's legislative agenda, apparently the government's difficulties are yet again the opposition's fault. We had an extraordinary press release issued on 13 September by Senator Evans which sought to make that claim. It was also a media release that was pretty disrespectful to the Australian Senate. It was headed 'Extended sitting hours for Senate to pass legislation'. It said the Senate will sit an extra week and have extended sitting hours for the remainder of the spring session to deal with the government's full legislative agenda. The only problem is there was no proposition at that time before the Australian Senate to do that. The Australian Senate had not consid­ered that particular proposition. I will give Senator Ludwig credit: he would never show such discourtesy and disrespect to the Australian Senate by issuing a press release of that nature.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was quite extraordinary. On 13 Septem­ber that release was issued. Here we are on 21 September now for the first time having this matter before the Senate to debate. It just goes to show the level of disrespect and the level of contempt that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has for this chamber, that he would put out a press release stating what the Australian Senate was going to do before the Australian Senate had even had the opportunity to consider it. It was compounded by Mr Albanese, who on 12 September declared that the upper house would sit an extra week starting on 7 November. How great is that: the Leader of the House telling the Australian Senate what it will do. In the press release by Senator Evans he accused the opposition of delaying tactics and that is part of the justification which Senator Ludwig canvassed, delaying tactics apparently by the opposition, as to why extended hours and an extra week are needed. That is wrong. It is a pretty obvious point: we are an opposition, this is a house of review and we have actually got a job to do to scrutinise legislation. We are not going to curtail debate because the government does not enjoy scrutiny. Let's face it, it is not as though this government has an unblemished record on public administration that does not warrant a bit of decent scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Evans in that same press release said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is time for the opposition to stop its negative obstruction and start dealing with legislation in a constructive manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do. This has been an exceptionally constructive opposition. We routinely facilitate the swift passage of non-controversial and time-critical legislation. In fact, last week, with the cooperation of the opposition, I think it was 14 bills that passed through this chamber. This week already we have had four bills pass through the chamber, and one of the first items of business today was exempting four bills from the cut-off—something which the opposition readily agreed to because we take a practical and a constructive approach to the management of business in this chamber. But there is no obligation on this opposition, or any opposition for that matter, to facilitate bad legislation. There is no obligation on us as an opposition to deny due scrutiny to bad policy. There is no obligation on any party particularly to facilitate legislation that seeks to break a solemn election commitment. So the opposition completely rejects the accusa­tions of delaying tactics, of negativity and of obstructionism canvassed in Senator Evans's press release and also by Senator Ludwig.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another point that is important to bear in mind, and that it is the government's obligation to manage their legislative program within the sitting schedule that it publishes. That sitting schedule is published at the end of each year for the coming year. That is the government 's call. They set the timetable; they set the agenda. We reject the request for the extension of hours and the extra sitting week because the government should be able to manage within the hours that are scheduled. That does not mean that as an opposition we always will say or always have said no to extra hours. The opposition have on occasion agreed to extra hours for government business. But the onus is on the government to make the case for a change to the sitting schedule and they have not done so. So we will be voting against the proposed extension of hours and also the additional week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will respond, no doubt, as they usually do, that the opposition does not like to sit late, but I think you would be hard-pressed, Madam Acting Deputy President, to find an opposition that has worked harder than this opposition. If the government needed more time, they should have scheduled extra weeks in the first place. As I said, they are the government, they scheduled the sitting weeks and it is their responsibility to manage their legislative agenda within that schedule. But, if you were to listen to those opposite, this is apparently another problem of the opposition's making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great lies here is that the government lacks the capacity to properly manage the legislative agenda. They certain­ly have the ability—I guess that is a better way to put it—to manage the legislative agenda but they lack the capacity, it would seem. In the House the government has a governing block and in the Senate the Labor-Greens alliance has the numbers, as we have seen with Senator Brown and his extraordin­ary declaration today that he is very comfort­able with the guillotine being exercised. We have heard minister after minister over recent weeks declaring how well the parlia­ment is going and how many pieces of legislation have passed the parliament. Many members of the gallery have cited those ministers, saying, 'Well, you have to give it to the government, they have got a lot of legislation through.' But the government cannot have it both ways. They cannot in one breath say that the parliament is working well, with legislation flying through it, and then in the next breath say that the opposition is being obstructionist. It defies logic to hold those two propositions in contention at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crux of the motion that is before us is the matter of the government seeking an extra week of parliament. That week is being sought for one reason and one reason alone: the carbon tax. The opposition feel absolute­ly no compunction to accede to this request. The proposition the government is putting to the Senate for an extra sitting week is essen­tially that the Senate should be complicit in facilitating the government to break a solemn commitment to the Australian people. That is really what this motion is about. They are asking the Australian Senate to be complicit in facilitating a lie. The opposition will not be complicit in that venture. We will say no. The Prime Minister went to the last election vowing not to introduce a carbon tax. Every Labor member and senator in fact has a mandate not to introduce a carbon tax. There could be nothing clearer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In seeking to sidestep that particular fact, Senator Ludwig referred to how long the proposition of putting a price on carbon has been in public debate. He said we have been debating this since 1994. Give me a break! I would have thought that the proposition before the Australian people—in fact there was no proposition before the Australian people in 1994, so I should say that the extent to which this matter was in public debate surely would have been a completely different concept. It was something that was barely in the public consciousness. To cite back to 1994, and any public discussion that there might have been then, as some justification as to why we do not need proper and decent scrutiny in 2011 was, I thought, a little far-fetched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is absolutely no rush to get this legislation through the parliament. I have not heard a credible rationale as to why debate on this package of bills in the Australian Senate should be restricted to two weeks. The only rationale I can glean is that it is an attempt to deny appropriate scrutiny. Already we have 19 bills being corralled into one committee. It is a committee that is stacked and does not reflect the makeup of the Australian parliament. It is a committee whose deputy chairmanship, against all convention in this place, has gone to the Australian Greens. It is stacked and its outcome is a foregone conclusion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is bad enough that the government sought to evade the scrutiny of the Australian people at the election. It is bad enough that the government went to the Australian people with a lie. It is bad enough that the government formed office on the back of a lie—we know it well: that there would be no carbon tax under a government led by Ms Gillard. Does anyone seriously believe that the Australian Labor Party would have won enough seats to form government had they come clean with the Australian people before the election? There is only one answer to that: no, of course they would not have. We all know that. That is why they fibbed to the Australian people in the first place. I do not think it is a stretch to call that a form of electoral fraud, not in a legal sense, not in a technical sense, but in a moral sense. That electoral fraud is something the Australian Labor Party will be accountable to the Australian people for. It is something that the Australian Labor Party will ultimately be answerable for at the polls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The place in which we stand today is the place where the government of the day is answerable and accountable in between elections. We know that they fibbed to the Australian people and there is nothing we can do about that here today. But in between elections this is the place where the government is accountable, and it is in the committees of the parliament, as well, that there is accountability. Having evaded public scrutiny the least the government should do is allow the most full-blooded scrutiny and debate in this place. The government's answer to that is, 'Look, what are you complaining about. We are scheduling an extra week and some extra sitting hours.' No, that is not good enough. You had a legislative program and you should have managed within it. This package of bills is so significant that it should not be a matter of weeks being allocated to it; it should be a matter of months being allocated to it. We have heard from the Greens that this package has to go through the parliament because of a conference at Durban. A conference at Durban? I am sorry but I am not terribly fussed about what whoever is at that conference in Durban thinks. I care what the Australian people think. I care about the effect legislation passed through this parlia­ment has on the Australian people—on their cost of living and on the capacity of business to sell their goods and services. That is what I am concerned about, not some conference in Durban. I am not concerned with provid­ing an opportunity for the government and the Greens to strut about waving their legislation and saying, 'Terrific, aren't we great. Look at what we got through.' That could not be of less interest to me and it could not be of less interest to the Australian people. Durban is an artificial barrier. It is bad enough that the government fibbed to the Australian people. It is bad enough that they formed government on the back of lie. The very least this government should do to seek to salvage some dignity is have a proper full-blooded debate in this place. They should go to the Australian people. They should call an election, but we know they are not going to do that because the result would be clear.</span>

The model for scrutiny of significant economic change is the goods and services tax, which I think was change for good, unlike the carbon tax. I would argue that, whether you think the carbon tax is good or bad, it is a much more far-reaching change to the Australian economy than the GST ever was and, as such, it deserves greater scrutiny. The model for scrutiny is the GST as introduced under the Howard government. The contrast betw­een our approach to significant economic change—I will not call it 'reform' because it is not—under this government and the significant economic reform under the previous coalition government could not be more different. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the coalition sought a mandate at an election. There was no hiding, no subterfuge. Having won a mandate, we submitted our legislation to the most searing and searching scrutiny of any legislative package in the history of this parliament. At that time, the GST legislation sat on the table in the House before it was debated—some­thing which has not occurred with the carbon tax legislation. After it passed the House and came to the Senate, the GST legislation spent five months in Senate committees—not a couple of weeks; five months. And after 25 November  1998, when the Senate establish­ed the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System, that committee referred issues to three separate Senate references commit­tees. At that time we had a total of four Senate committees examining the goods and services tax legislation. We followed a good and proper process. We introduced the bills, they sat on the table, we did not rush and the House had hours to debate. We did the right thing. We subjected the legislation to the appropriate scrutiny of the Australian parliament after having sought and gained a mandate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should withdraw this motion for extra hours. They should withdraw this motion for an extra sitting week. They should also discharge the 19 carbon tax bills currently before the House. They should call an election. They should submit themselves—their tax, their legis­lation, their policy—to the judgment of the Australian people. If they did that and if they won, I would be the first person to say, 'Fine, bring the legislation on. Let's have a Senate committee process.' Even then, if they followed that process, I would still be arguing that there should be a good five months of scrutiny in this place for a package of this magnitude.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if the parliament as a whole thinks that something is a good idea, that legislation is worthwhile, we still have a role to perform in the Australian Senate and in Senate committees—to be a fresh set of eyes, even on legislation for which there is wide agreement. For legislation for which there is not wide agreement our role is even more important—that is our job, that is what we should do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion before the Senate is about the cessation and guillotining of debate. It forms part of the sense I have of the absolute hypocrisy of where the Greens are. I have to be honest. Ever since the Greens voted against an inquiry into the rape of an Aboriginal girl in 1988 by youths from the John Oxley Youth Detention Centre, one Annette Harding, I have not taken them seriously. They lost their moral compass at that moment. At that moment they just became like everybody else. So now we see the continuation of this duplicitous type of arrangement of the feigned and faux nobility that they try to exude and then the reality of actually what they are given the dirty little tricks that they are starting to play, whether it is the anti-Semitic edge that they have now got with the boycott of certain shops that they stand behind without even blinking, whether it is voting against the inquiry into the rape of an Aboriginal girl in 1988 at the John Oxley Detention Centre, a rape that nobody denies and that we have been trying to purge and trying to clear for so long—and they were part of that cover-up—and whether we are now we seeing the guillotine of a debate, something that in the past they continually said that they would not be a part of. We have seen the metamorphosis of the Greens and they are now just another party. So let us dispense with this allure of some sort of nobility, some sort of an edge and maybe some sort of a sense of righteousness and of purity, because that is lost; it is gone. Of course, the other issue as to that is this $1.6 million donation from Wotif and then the question is asked by Senator Bob Brown on that proprietor's behalf. It is absurd how it is done with this stupid little smile that they get on their face when we talk about this. Why do they do it? How does this happen?</span>

It is time to go to Durban: Durban is nice this time of year, the Greens have to get there—so we have to get this through. There is the whole metamorphosis of this debate. It started as being about global warming and then it became about climate change and now it is about clean energy. It just changes like the days and as one thing is stated as being absolutely ridiculous they just move the debate on. As we know, the reality is that this tax is not going to change the temperature one iota. What I will give the Greens credit for is that they are about to bring about a new creed that it is immoral to be provident and now we have this new gospel, and the gospel needs a creed and the creed is this piece of policy. That is what it is: it is the structure around it; all new religions need a creed to stand by and this is it. The purpose is not so much to do with the environment, because it does nothing for the environment; the purpose is about a form of social re-engineering and a form of change. I do not know how the Labor Party got themselves sucked into this. I honestly believe, and I fervently believe this, there are people on the other side in the Labor Party who know that this is an absolute crock but they are doing it to curry favour with a group that are going to destroy them and you can see that in the polls at the moment. It is not smart for the party of Curtin, Chifley and—dare I say it—Whitlam to be sucked in by this. So it is not about changing the climate and I can understand the sense of unease that certain members such as Senator Conroy have about this—and they are justified in feeling that unease because—</span>

But, no, we cannot go there because there will be dragons out there so don't go there! It is like the margin analysis on old maritime maps, saying 'don't go there, don't talk to the people of Tamworth and don't dare talk to the people of Orange, and don't go talking to the people of Longreach, but talk to the people of Melbourne; talk to the beautiful people. Have them come in. Make it nice and quiet and sedate because we've just got to get this through because Bob's got to go to Durban'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when we think about regional Australia, we should think of the source of the wealth of this nation: the area where the coalmines are, the area where the iron-ore mines are, the area where the cotton fields are, the area where the wheat fields are and the area where many of the tourism venues are—the area that is going to get absolutely smacked between the eyes if this tax goes through. That is not an ambit claim. That is the result of some of the inquiries that have been made by state Labor governments when those governments have been more honest than the federal government on this issue and have talked about the epicentre of effect—the towns of Rockhampton, Gladstone and other places that are going to be hit with this, as will the Hunter Valley. So I say to Kirsten Livermore: you went to your people and gave a warrant that you would not be a part of a carbon tax. Well, Kirsten Livermore, you have misrepresented it; you have told an untruth to the people of Rockhampton. To Joel Fitzgibbon and Sharon Grierson in the Hunter Valley: you have told an untruth to the people of the Hunter Valley —</span>

Because this is the Green-Labor Party-Independent alliance—the glee club—who are the same people that gave us the ceiling insulation debacle where we spent $1½ billion putting fluffy stuff in the ceiling for the rats and mice to sleep on and then spent another billion dollars pulling it all back out again after we had set fire to 194 houses and had, tragically, killed four people. It is that type of acumen that is now, at pace, bringing in this carbon tax. They are the same people who brought us the Building Education Revolution where transportable dongas were landed in yards and places such as Manila in northern New South Wales for—whatever it was—$1.8 million for a transportable, bolted together modular bit of gear. People have been absolutely ripped off and touched. </span>

We look at what is happening overseas right now in Spain, Italy, Greece and the United States of America, and, in the middle of that, it is culpable that our nation should even contemplate going down this insane path whilst we are sitting with $205 billion in gross debt at a time when we are in a boom and we should be collecting money and putting it in the bank. We are remarkable. We reach the absolute pinnacle of our times as far as our resource prices go and this buffoon, who may or may not be the Treasurer for much longer, has managed to rack up $205 billion in gross debt.</span>

We have gone from buying $2.7 billion in carbon credits in 2020 and sending that overseas to buying $2.8 billion that we will be sending overseas. What is another $100 million between mates? I was looking at prospective letters and in the future we might get a letter like this from the office of Mr Soolaimon Bellow<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>of the African Development Bank: 'Please transfer $2.8 billion into my account and I, the Auditor-General of the African Development Bank, will during the course of events deliver you some carbon credits.' Of course, where we are going is just so logical! You know where this ends up? Down the track we will end up sending $56 million a year overseas. People must be falling over themselves laughing at us and saying: 'Something has happened in Australia. There is something in the water in Australia. The Greens have obviously managed, in the dark of the night, to legalise marijuana. They're all just hooking up. They've got some crazy ideas. They're crazy people over in Australia. They're cooling the planet and they are going to be sending all of us $56 million a year in 2050.' Do not worry about our pensioners, do not worry about their teeth, do not worry about our kids—no, we have got a job to do: we must find every scam artist on the globe and send them a cheque for carbon credits. </span>

In it they are going to come up with ideas because they are ideas people—straight to the pool room. We are going to have ideas coming from them—a new set of global warming jousting sticks. The ideas are going to be like those which we have seen in America where, the other day, they wrote off a loan in excess of $535 million. It was just one of those green ideas. These things seem to come unstuck. The problem is that they do not make much money. They tell us about green jobs. Where are these green jobs? Where are these people? I am looking for one. I ask Australia: if someone out there has a green job please ring up and tell me where you are, because we are apparently all going to have green jobs. We do not have to worry in the future about our coalminers or meatworkers. We do not have to worry about the manufacturing industry, which they used to represent, because they are going on this perverse path of green jobs—of wind chime manufacturers and duck pond makers. That is how we will survive in the future when we have got to pay back their stinking debt: we will survive with just green jobs and beautiful thoughts.</span>

The New South Wales Treasury figures show the carbon tax will lead to 31,000 lost jobs in New South Wales, but over 26,000 of these will be in regional Australia. But we have not got an inquiry going on into regional Australia, because Bob has got to go to Durban. He has to go surfing and he has to tell the people in Durban what a wonderful person he is. So let us not worry about regional Australia and the 26,000 people in regional Australia who are going to lose their jobs, including 18,500 in the Hunter. If you are listening to me, you people in the Hunter, I say that Joel Fitzgibbon is going to vote for 18,500 people to lose their jobs. Maybe he should just lose his job, or maybe he should do the noble thing and cross the floor and vote against it.

We need an inquiry to tell people that 18,500 people in Hunter Valley, 7,000 people in the Illawarra and 1,000 people on the Central Coast are going to lose their jobs. They are going to lose their jobs because of the carbon tax, because of this nutty, stupid policy. But they do not get the grace of an inquiry. The government is going to guillotine time.

In the Rockhampton and Gladstone area the economic activity will fall by 8.2 per cent. So I say to the people of Rockhampton, in the seat of Kirsten Livermore MP, that she should be encouraging an extension of time. Maybe we should have an inquiry in Rockhampton where we tell the people of Rockhampton what is going to happen to their lives if they vote for this. In the Mackay area economic activity will go down by 5.7 per cent. Who cares? Who cares about regional Australia when you can pander to the Manic Monkey Cafe of inner-urban Nirvanaville? Who cares about them? They are only the people who put the money on the table. Don't worry about them—we will somehow live without them in this new mad form of economics, with a Treasurer who has an award from the same place that awarded Bear Stearns. It also awarded Lehman Brothers as the bank of the year. It never gave Peter Costello anything but it did give Paul Keating the Treasurer of the year award before we had 'the recession we had to have'. Why not?</span>

You will literally get chased down the street by people who were formerly supporters of the Australian Labor Party. They are blue-collar conservative workers who have bailed on the Australian Labor Party because the Labor Party no longer believes in labour. They have dropped the 'u' out of 'labour'.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="G1N" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KROGER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  It is with real regret that I am standing up to discuss this because it is a motion that we should not have to consider and it is a demonstration that this is a sad day for Australian democracy. Why is it a sad day for Australian democracy? Because the government, in moving this variation of hours, is demonstrating that what we are witnessing here today is the tail wagging the dog. We are seeing the tail wagging the dog with the Greens running the show here. Senator Brown, the Leader of the Greens, said earlier on that this was based on consensus, that this was a consensus arrange­ment. It was clearly a consensus arrangement between the government and the Greens, but I would suggest that it would be reasonable to ask: who actually pitched this arrange­ment? Was it the government or was it the Greens who put this arrangement together?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a clear demonstration that we have a minority party running the agenda of this country. Let us not forget not only what has happened in the last 12 months since this government came to office but the way in which the agenda has rolled out over that time. We must note that when the Leader of the Greens, Senator Brown, gets up and speaks of a consensus arrangement he is the leader of a minority party that could not even win a seat in the House of Representatives in its own right. It could not win one seat. Such is its minority support in Australia that it could not win one seat in its own right. It only won its seat with preferences, and I would suggest to those who are listening to this broadcast that they stay tuned for the next election because I would like to see whether the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, can win that seat in his own right. I would think that the Australian people and the constituents of the seat of Melbourne will have a very different view as to who they are supporting at the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a minority party that probably do not get any more than 10 per cent of the vote across the country. We have a minority party that, as we see in the news polls on a regular basis, are not improving their support. Their support base is declining. We have a minority party that get up here in this chamber and argue about scrutiny of the media. They supported an inquiry into the media, and we hear day in and day out in this chamber that the Leader of the Greens hates criticism. They cannot cope with any criti­cism levelled at them. The minute that they are given proper and due scrutiny, they scream foul and call for a media inquiry. The sad fact for the Australian population is that the tail is wagging the dog. It is the Greens who are influencing and leaning on the government in terms of the agenda that has been established and it is the Greens that are very much behind this agreement to vary the hours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we concerned about it? The parliamentary schedule, the sitting dates for each calendar year, is established by the government in the previous year. I under­stand that it is the Prime Minister of the day himself or herself who sits down and consid­ers their policy and agenda criteria, their priorities and what they want to achieve in a year. One would think that the determination of that would be based on election commit­ments that were given. This government went to the last election, in August of last year, saying that there would be no carbon tax under any government that the Prime Minister leads, but it did a backflip. Why did it do a backflip? Because the Australian Labor Party could not form government in its own right. We had an agonising seven-day period, when clearly negotiations were going on behind the scenes, that ended with the Greens and some Independents supporting the current Prime Minister in forming government. But she and the government use that as an excuse as to why they cannot have a properly laid out legislative framework for the year. It is because of that that she has come back and said: 'No, a carbon tax is critical for this country. This package'—this so-called clean energy package—'is abso­lutely critical and it is vital that it gets through this year.' We know that is because as part of the deal with the Greens the Australian Labor Party in government is supporting the imposition of a carbon tax on all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the parliamentary calendar, you will see that it was established last year and was circulated to all MPs and senators so that they could plan their business itineraries for the coming 12 months. It is very import­ant for MPs and senators to be able to do that. You will note that there is a great blank in the calendar during the first six months of this year. Only six sitting weeks were scheduled for the first half of this year, yet we have a fairly intensive program for the second half of the year. I am one to put up my hand and say that I do not mind being here at all and that I am prepared to do whatever hours it takes to make sure that we scrutinise legislation properly. Senator Conroy, you are sitting opposite; I will ask you. The shape of the parliamentary calendar begs the question: why did we sit for only six weeks in the first half of the year? Why was that determined? Did it have anything to do with the formal alliance of the Greens and the ALP, which I am going to call a coalition of the willing because it is a coalition? In the government's words it is a formal alliance, but the Australian public knows it is a coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the parliamentary calendar was framed this way because you could not form a majority in this place until after 1 July. The suggestion that you could not properly consider the legislative frame­work flies in the face of integrity when so much more could have been done in the first half of this year and when it was the decision of this government not to go down that track. Do not come in here and cry foul that you cannot possibly get all the legislative work done when it was your decision that determined the framework for the parlia­mentary sitting period. Your failure to do this is yet another demonstration of this government's incompetence and mismanage­ment across the board. We have seen knee-jerk reactions to rolling crises in the country, and this is yet another example of this government not appropriately managing the agenda before it. We know this because of what the government and the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, have said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know why we have to vary the business hours in the next few weeks. It is because of Durban, as Senator Brown has said in his own words. It is because he wants to go to Durban with his partner, Prime Minister Gillard. He wants to go with the delegation of 40 or 50 public servants from the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency that will go. He wants to go to the Durban conference with this parcel under his arm—this parcel that is the carbon tax, beautifully wrapped, probably in green velvet double bows. He wants to be able to go to the conference and say: 'Here we are; we have delivered it. No other country in the world has introduced an economy-wide carbon tax, but I have managed to convince the government here in Australia that this is what we are doing. I am the best man in the world.' It is all about international grand­standing. That is what it is about. It is not about proper scrutiny; it is about intern­ational grandstanding. It is a disgrace that the government is not standing up to the Greens in this endeavour. This is an indictment of the government and it will play out in the future. I have to say that, if we vary these hours today, you should be careful of what you wish for, because you know the Australian public does not support it. You will not take us to an election now to get an electoral mandate for this, because you know the Australian public does not support it. We say: 'Bring on an election.' If you want to play these games and form consensual alliances with the Greens whilst in office, be careful of what you ask for in view of a time when you will be out of office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation, which was mentioned earlier on. It is extraordinary that this joint committee was formally established only last Thursday. It has called for submissions, which had to be in writing and submitted within only five working days, I think. The first hearing is being held today. Treasury were asked, as was the minister, on countless occasions, for the modelling so that it could be properly considered through this process. Treasury had been non-forthcoming with that modelling. Yet I see that literally minutes or seconds before the beginning of that hearing today Treasury released their figures. That was only this morning—minutes before the hearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of the inquiry and the point of any of these inquiries is to provide proper scrutiny of all the relevant material. One would have thought that Treasury modelling based on a $23 per tonne tax would have been relevant to this inquiry—to the scrutiny of this legislation. Yet this modelling was only made available to the committee members literally minutes before the hearing convened. How could the members of the committee give that modelling due consideration so that they could ask Treasury relevant questions about to it? This is yet another example of the way in which this whole thing is being truncated—not so that there can be proper, transparent consider­ation and scrutiny of these 19 bills and 1,100 pages of extraordinary detail but so that the legislation can be rammed through before Durban in early December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an even sadder day when I heard that convention that has been applied in this place for considerable time was just put aside—without any decent advice and certainly with no respect given to the opposition—when it was determined that the committee would be headed up by a government chairman, which is normal practice, and a deputy chair from the Greens, Senator Milne. It begs the question: how does that reflect on the independence of this committee to properly scrutinise this clean energy future package, as it is called, when the construct of the committee itself is not independent? We know what happens in other committees; we see it every day. The chair and deputy chair positions are held by government and opposition members or senators so that there is some form of independence in the committees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate committees are an incredibly important part of the business of the Senate, ensuring that all legislation is properly scrutinised. But that was certainly not the case with this joint select committee. One has to ask the question again: why is it that the Greens were able to displace normal convention—to displace an opposition senator in that deputy chair position and take it for themselves? I am asking these questions but, I must say, the answers look pretty obvious. It is a sad day when we see a minority party having this sort of influence over a government agenda. You have to question how that is playing out behind the scenes and what is going on. We see what is going on in here, but we do not know what is actually going on behind the scenes between these two parties.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you for your courtesy, Mr Acting Deputy President. My challenge to the government is that they actually start walking the talk, as opposed to talking the walk. If they believe that the Greens are a problem for them—the Greens, who are causing a huge chasm within their own ranks between the Left and the Right of the ALP—then it is time they actually walked the talk and did something about it. I think Minister Conroy could well heed some advice on that one.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, we are not going to support this variation of business hours. It is not because we do not want to be in this place. We do believe that the work we do here is vitally important. We do have concerns about the implications of this variation to business hours, which in effect will mean—including a possible visit from the President of the United States—that we will be in Canberra every week for a seven-week period, or something like that. This has huge ramifications for the effectiveness and the running of our electorate offices. It is a problem for those constituents who have organised meetings with us in advance. It is a problem for the work that we do at a local level. It means that members of parliament will not be able to get back and do the work that they do so assiduously when parliament is not sitting—because we know that the work of the federal parliament does not cease when people leave this place; there is an intensive business program on when people leave here. So this means that a lot of local constituent work will have to be put on hold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not support this. We do not support this because it is just a shocking reflection on the government of the shambolic approach that they have taken to setting the legislative framework and schedule for this year. Even more concerning is the reflection on them of the way in which they are just responding to the agenda of the Greens. They are not in charge here. They are certainly not demon­strating that they are in control. They are very much responding to the demands—in many cases hysterical demands—of the Greens. It is a disgrace on them. I condemn them for the influence that the Greens have on them. We will not be supporting this.</span>

                  </a>  and somehow complicit in being asked to endorse the government's breaking of an election promise. It is a question that comes to the credibility of this government. I note that Senator Conroy is in the chamber and interjecting. Whilst I will not respond directly to his interjections, I note that Senator Conroy is galvanising as much support as he can in his party to prevent Kevin Rudd from assuming the leadership once again. He is also trying to dump this dreadful policy, because there are many on the Labor side who realise the political damage that has been done to the Labor Party by the words of Ms Gillard—'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'—and Mr Swan and other acolytes. That was a crystal clear, rock-solid promise, and we are being asked today to endorse the breaking of that promise by granting additional hours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many in the Labor Party do not want this to see the light of day, but we also know that the real power behind the Gillard throne is resident in the wedge at the end of the government side of the chamber, and that is Senator Bob Brown and his Greens party. If there ever was a credibility gulf amongst politicians and political parties, it is demonstrated every single day by the Greens party. We can talk about their openness and transparency requirements for donations. Whilst they rail against corporate donations, they have taken the single largest corporate donation in the history of politics in this country—$1.6 million from the founder of Wotif. Then, by some strange quirk of fate, some coincidence, Senator Bob Brown and his tribe have asked questions that are going to benefit that donor in his commercial operations. In any other forum, there would be questions about how such a coincidence arose, but not to the pious and sanctimonious Senator Brown, who says, 'I'm doing everything within the legitimacy of this parliament.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same party, might I add, that say they are out there looking after children and young people and speaking up for their interests and yet, when I introduced a private senator's bill to protect children overseas from predatory Australians who would seek to exploit them for child sex tourism offences, they voted against it. They voted against protecting children from predatory sexual tourists under Australian law. It makes you wonder where their moral compass is. As Senator Joyce said, this is the party that voted against an inquiry into the abusive rape of a 14-year-old Aboriginal girl in Queensland. This is the party of hypocrisy, the party that says you should not be allowed to use plastic water bottles unless it is for a medical emergency, and yet their deputy leader has on her own website a picture of herself clutching a plastic water bottle as she strolls around some mountain bushland environment. This is the party of hypocrisy, where Senator Bob Brown exceeded the number of flights of both the former environment minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the shadow environment minister at the time, Peter Garrett, while travelling around the country and preaching to others that they should not be emitting these noxious fumes that are destroying the planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have established beyond a shadow of a doubt—and I think the Australian people need to understand—just how dangerously hypocritical the Greens party is. What they say and what they do are two different things. What they say in public is to appease people and make them think they are protecting the environment, but what they do is that they are trying to shut down industrial Australia. They are trying to increase taxes. Unfortunately, they have an inordinate amount of power over a hapless, hopeless, rudderless government in Australia at the moment, and that is the Gillard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frauds have been perpetuated on so many Australians with the misuse, abuse, waste and squandering of taxpayers' money. We have seen it with pink batts, with GROCERYchoice, with Fuelwatch and with a whole bunch of other schemes. Today it has been reported that regional rorts are going on, that two-thirds of the money has gone to Labor electorates and only one-third to other electorates in regional Australia—completely disproportionate. We know that the standards, scrutiny, accountability and ethics of the government and their alliance partners, the Greens, are at rock bottom, and that is why their vote is at rock bottom. That is why they are all scrambling around to get the numbers for Kevin Rudd to come back. I know there are those on that side of the chamber who are deeply concerned about that, because they possibly will lose their jobs. They will lose their frontbench jobs because they so brutally knifed Mr Rudd before the Australian people could do it. There will be a big reshuffle. There will be a grand realignment of the factional schemes. You may not see Senator Conroy and Senator Carr lining up on the same team anymore. But we will see a change of government and hopefully the restoration of some integrity to it. We need to get a bit of decency, honesty and transparency back in the public debate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the areas that strikes me as extraordinary is that Senator Wong and others will stand up and talk about green jobs and the experience overseas. What I would like to do for the benefit of the Australian people and those listening to this broadcast is detail one of the experiences overseas of the great hope for Centre Left governments right around the world—and that is the American government, led by Barack Obama. Only this morning a commentator reported that $17.2 billion has been spent by the US government on creating green jobs. I wonder just how many jobs $17.2 billion could create under a Centre Left government. Remember: the dream that is being pitched to all Australians is that this carbon tax will not hurt our economy because it is going to create jobs. How many jobs did $17.2 billion create in America? Was it one million? Was it two million? Was it 500,000? Unfortunately, that was not the case. It created 3,545 jobs. If you quickly do the maths, it works out to be $4.853 million per job. This is the future that we are being sold. The Australian people are being peddled this nirvana. But the results are there. The examples are there.</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, I do come back to it. We are talking about the decarbonisation of our economy, which is what this extension of powers is intended to legitimately pursue. We know that. You may have missed my reference to the $17.2 billion being spent in America to create 3,545 jobs. It concerns me that we are heading down the same path, because the Greens tail is wagging this dog of a government. That is not the future I imagine. I imagine a future for my children where there will be industry, productivity, growth and a sense of optimism about the future. Unfortunately, this tax, which we are being asked to endorse ipso facto through this extension of hours, endorsing a broken promise, is really beyond the pale. When we examine why this government is pursuing this ideological bent we see there is no benefit at all for Australia to go down this path and for the Senate to extend sitting hours without applying that time to examining the implications of this broken promise for the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Treasurer released Treasury modelling just a few moments before a committee was due to sit. The credibility of this Treasurer has to be brought into question as well. I know much will be made of the fact—and he posed for a great photo—that he was named Euromoney Finance Minister of the Year. It follows a great tradition, as Senator Joyce referred to, set by Paul Keating, a former world's greatest Treasurer who gave us 'the recession we had to have'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think the tradition of Euromoney awards is more starkly and contemporan­eously spelt out by revisiting their 2006 awards. Euromoney said the best investment bank was Lehman Brothers. Of course, Lehman Brothers went broke in 2007. In 2006 Euromoney said that the best equity house was a group called Morgan Stanley. Of course, Morgan Stanley had to be bailed out to the tune of billions of dollars in 2007. In 2006 Euromoney, the same people who awarded Mr Swan Finance Minister of the Year, said the best risk management house was a group called Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns, of course, busted and went broke in 2007. In 2006 the best investor services according to Euromoney were Citigroup, another group that had to have billions of dollars worth of bailouts in 2007. So when they award Treasurer Swan as best finance minister of the year we are right to be dubious about the category he is inserting himself into because he follows in the great tradition of those busted outfits and the man who said Australia had to have a recession with 17 per cent interest rates, and it follows in the tradition that this Labor government has run up billions of dollars of taxpayer debt, mortgaging the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor want to further compromise the future of the Australian people and hurt successive generations by imposing an all-pervading tax on carbon dioxide. They are doing it under the mantle of presuming that there are going to be green jobs. We have busted that myth, just like Euromoney have given the kiss of death to other firms. We also know there is a very clear indication that this is a tax that will grow and grow and that tens of billions of dollars ultimately will be sent to countries without the scrutiny and accountability that exists under the Austra­lian legislative and corporate framework. We also know that this is an attempt at an election sweetener by reforming some of the tax system and applying some additional benefits to pensioners and others, most of which would be welcome because of the cost-of-living rises that have taken place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the disingenuous nature of it: the government has steadfastly refused to identify and acknowledge that this all-pervading tax will only increase in the future. It will go from $23 at the starting point and it will rise to $29 within a couple of years. Of course, that will put the price of electricity up. It will put the price of everything we use up because ultimately electricity is the thing that is used to light shops, keep refrigeration going, create cement; there are a whole range of applica­tions. This is a tax on electricity, so nothing will escape it. It will continue to rise. Even when it goes to a market based mechanism, of course, which was rejected by the Labor Party; that was their 2007 policy—</span>

We are going to see the export of industry and the export of jobs; we are not going to see the creation of green jobs. We know that this government is desperate for the cash that is going to be generated from that. But it cannot even do that appropriately. This is a new tax where apparently everyone is going to be better off, but we know that is not going to be the case.

They do not want a carbon tax, not because they do not care about the environment but because they know that it will do nothing for the environment. They know that it will not lower global temperatures one jot or tittle. We know that. We absolutely know that and no-one has ever disputed it. They also know that billions of their dollars are going to be sent offshore to unaccountable regimes or organisations. You are going to see it go to an international United Nations fund and you are also going to have to buy permits from nations which have a less than rigorous reputation for financial transparency and honesty.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a more deliberate concern amongst the Australian people and that is that we have a government that have deceived the Australian people. I wish you could say that they had a deceptive aura of confidence or competence even, but unfortu­nately you cannot, because they have demon­strated no competence in any aspect of administering the national affairs of this country. We can look at it in so many ways—I touched upon pink batts and GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch. We can look at the rorting in Building the Education Revolution, as they called it. We can look at the laptops in schools rorting. We can look at border protection: the East Timor solution, the Malaysia solution. It can go on and on and on. It is one disaster after another. And today we are being asked to extend hours to be complicit in another disaster for the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber it is very clear that we will not support that and we will not support it because we want our integrity intact. We want to be consistent in our approach to taking effective policy solu­tions—not things that are going to damage the Australian people, not things that are going to irreparably damage our economy, not the myth of green jobs. We do not want the $17 billion that Barack Obama, President of the United States, spent on creating 3,545 jobs. We do not want that myth. We want accountability, we want strength and we want, most of all, competence from the Australian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the weakness of the government, their shallowness, their lack of capacity in administrative skills and their lack of vision for the future of this country mean that they are now being driven by an extreme left-wing green ideology. We know the hypocrisy of that ideology. We know that they will stand up and say and do anything and then do something else behind the scenes. We know that they want to apply different standards to different people. It is like Orwell's <span style="font-style:italic;">Animal Farm</span>, where some animals are more equal than others. Let me tell you that in this place we should all be equal and we should all have one vote. Unfortunately, those on the government side of the chamber have effectively given their votes away to their faceless men and to the faceless women of the Greens party. We know who is driving the government and the agenda. We know that Labor are weak and they are perhaps the worst government in the history of this country.</span>

                  </a>  The way I am going I may not, Senator Williams. The point is that we have a weak and hopeless government and now we have a green wedge that is seeking to drive its own ideological, obsessive agenda into destroying Australia as we know it and recreating it in the image of Bob Brown, Christine Milne and others like them. It is not the future for this country; it is not the future we anticipate and envisage for our children. It is a future which we can foresee by looking at America and Europe and at the failings of the green agenda there. That is why I do not support this motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="I0V" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion to vary the sitting hours of the Senate. What is this about? This is about the Greens wishing to go to Durban in South Africa in early December so that they can say to the rest of the world, 'Look at what we have achieved in Australia, our minority government'—a total of 10 members of parliament and senators out of a total of 226 in this place—'and how we dominate the government.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about time; it is about wishing to change the hours of the Senate to accommo­date the Greens—nothing more, nothing less. Yet in the three years I have been here I have noticed who the biggest time wasters have been: the Greens. How many divisions did they call when they had five, until 1 July this year, Greens senators in numerous divisions against at least 69, 70 or 71 other senators? And they say they have the numbers! They must be terrible at mathematics to think that five is greater than 70. Yet they are now saying, 'Let's extend time so that we can pass this legislation on the carbon tax and so we'—that is, the Greens—'can be complicit in the broken promise of our Prime Minister to the Australian people prior to the last election.' That is what this is about: satisfying the Greens to get the carbon tax/emissions trading scheme through this parliament. Forget about proper committee hearings and proper inquiries and the Senate doing its job properly; it is about passing legislation to satisfy Bob Brown and the Greens so that they can gloat when they get to Durban.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This carbon tax will be a long argument and a long debate, unless of course the Greens and the government pull the guillo­tine down on it, and a huge tax and cost impost on Australia. Why the rush? Why does it have to be rushed through this parliament? That is a question that everyone should be asking. Those out there in radio land listening to this broadcast and those who are watching it on the internet or in their offices should be asking: why the rush? Why are you going to impose a tax of somewhere between $72 billion and $100 billion on Australian industries by 2020 and have to rush it through? That is what this debate here and now is about. Why the rush? That is a question that everyone should be asking.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Mason. It is the people's assembly. I find it quite concerning that last year China actually burnt 3.2 billion tonnes of coal—that is, 3,200 million tonnes of coal. They increased their consumption of coal last year by 434 million tonnes. Last year, Australia produced a total of 420 million tonnes of coal, yet China's consumption went up by more than that in just one year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are saying: 'Give us extended hours. Let's rush this through before the end of November.' Yet they are not saying, 'Hang on, China's CO2 emissions a year are currently 10.3 billion tonnes'—yes, that is 10,300 million tonnes—'and by 2020 will go to 17.9 billion tonnes.' I must acknowledge here my colleague Senator Cormann, who gave me those figures, which were put out by Treasury. China's CO2 is going to go up by 7,600 million tonnes a year by 2020, but we stand here in this chamber debating time extensions to rush this legislation through Australia's parliament. The 578 million tonnes of CO2 that Australia is producing, excluding bushfires, which will be another big threat this summer after the last couple of wet seasons, will go up by 43 million tonnes a year by 2020. Then we will go into buying those credits from overseas. That will be the joke of jokes: fraudulent carbon credits exposed at billions of dollars. By 2020 we will be buying $3.5 billion in credits from overseas. We will be spending that much money but who will be checking that they are genuine? You know what I think about this carbon tax, Mr Acting Deputy President.</span>

I totally believe in climate change. In fact, I believe the climate has been changing for millions of years. Just recently I was fortunate to spend three days at Airlie Beach, in the Whitsunday Islands, only to discover that 18,000 years ago the Whitsunday Islands were actually part of the Australian mainland because the sea levels were so low and that, 10,000 years ago, the globe warmed, the ice melted on the mainland and the seas rose and, hence, we now call them the Whitsunday Islands. The climate changed. What caused that climate change? What caused the globe to warm back then, Mr Acting Deputy President? Was it hoons in V8 Mustangs, putting out carbon dioxide and chucking wheelies? No, they did not exist then. Perhaps it was coal fired generators.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does it have to be through before the end of November? We do not see it rushed into other parliaments around the world. We see an emissions trading scheme of some 30 countries in Europe, where they produce 14 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide. About a dollar a head is their cost. But ours is going to come in at about $400 a head—$400 for every man, woman and child in Australia. And that is going to change the planet? No, it is not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I make is that we should not agree to the extension of hours in this chamber, for two reasons. One is the enormous amount of time that the Greens have wasted in this parliament, not only in this current parliament, the 43rd Parliament, but the 42nd Parliament prior to that, through calling ridiculous divisions where, frankly, they should all carry a calculator and do some figures and they might know the real numbers that stay around the chamber when those divisions are called. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this is a most important piece of policy with huge ramifications for our nation. Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, as a member of the Labor Party you would share my concern on manufactur­ing jobs in Australia. We have seen from BlueScope Steel the announcement of 1,000 jobs to go there plus some 400 contractors. What we are facing now is 105,000 manu­facturing jobs lost over the past three years. So why should we rush through another piece of legislation? Why should we extend the hours of this parliament on a policy that is going to cost more jobs in manufacturing? I thought the Labor Party actually cared about jobs, but that has obviously disappear­ed years ago. Why should we rush through a policy that the Transport Workers Union has referred to as a death tax? That was Tony Sheldon's evidence at our Senate select committee inquiry chaired by the very capable Senator Cormann. That is how the Transport Workers Union described the proposed 6.85c a litre increase in the excise on diesel for truckies.</span>

                  </a>  I certainly will, Mr Acting Deputy President. I normally do. I apologise for sliding off course there for a brief second. So we have a tax that needs to be rushed through this parliament that the Transport Workers Union described as a death tax. Mr Sheldon described it as a death tax because he said, 'Put those extra cost on our truckies it will sweat the drivers and sweat the trucks.' He is saying they will have to work longer hours to make a living, especially owner-drivers, and that will mean more neglect of the truck, of the rig. It could be, 'Hang on, the tyre is almost bald. It's all right, times are tough, I will get another trip out of this tyre.' Brake linings might be worn. 'No, it's all right, I can squeeze another trip out of them before I replace the brake linings.' That is what Mr Sheldon meant when he described this tax as a death tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But back to the argument we are debating. Why should we extend the hours, why should we rush when these are the concerns the Australian people have about what is being proposed? The situation is that we are going to impose this amount of money on the 500 biggest emitters of carbon dioxide in Australia, and we really do not know who they are. We have not seen the list. We hear figures that if they happen to be responsible for more than 25,000 cubic tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year then they are in, but if it is 24,999 you are out. We know the cement industry is a big emitter, and they cannot afford any of this tax, especially the way the current Australian dollar is, allowing imports to be so cheap because of our high exchange rate, which is obviously brought about by high interest rates in this country, which is obviously brought about by govern­ment policy. But that is an argument for another day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we should not support the extension of hours here. We should not just kowtow to the Greens, who want this crazy legislation that was guaranteed to the Australian people by the Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, prior to the election would not be introduced. In fact, it should be delayed until after the next election. That would be true democracy, to allow the Australian people to have a say on it. We have the member for New England, Mr Windsor, who proudly says, 'I will survey my electorate. I am the people's representative.' Mr Windsor did that recently on whether we should have changes to our tax system—not the carbon tax—and whether we should support same-sex marria­ge. But he did not survey his elector­ate on the carbon tax. If he will not do his job, I am glad to say that I am doing it for him. Last Monday I sent out 57,000 survey forms into the electorate of New England and also to the electorate of Lyne, where Mr Oakeshott MP is the sitting member. He will not do a survey in his electorate as well. Mr Windsor said at the last election in TV adverts, and I saw them in my own lounge room, 'Vote 1 Tony Windsor, the people's representative.' If he is the people's represen­tative, why doesn't he survey his electorate before there is any proceeding of this legi­slation in the House of Representatives or here? That is another reason why this should not be rushed through the parliament. That is another reason why we should not extend working hours here to have more sitting hours to rush through a policy simply beca­use the Greens are running this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will wind up by saying I do not support the motion being put forward. There is no cause for extension of working hours. We have seen the amount of legislation that has gone through this parliament this week. In fact, on Monday we almost ran out of legislation as bills were passing through so quickly. Now it is drop everything, extend hours, let us do the legislation for the Greens, the ones who are complicit in the Prime Minister breaking her guarantee to the Australian people prior to the election. The Australian people will not forget this. They will not forget many things this Prime Minister has done and this government has done to our nation. They will not forget the debt, the waste, the interest-rate rises and the commitment by the Prime Minister on Perth radio in July last year that she would never consider sending asylum seekers to countries which are not signatories to the refugee convention. But what is the argument in the House of Representatives today? It is over an issue where the government wishes to send asylum seekers to a country which is not a signatory to the refugee convention. Hence, the government has put up a bad argument for extending the hours for this particular reason. I urge my colleagues all around the chamber, perhaps some on the other side, to oppose this. But, no, if they were to do that they would be kicked out of their party and their future would be guillotined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no argument for this. This is an important piece of legislation and it should run its normal course. It should be allowed to go up to Senate committees, as well as to the joint committee that has been established, so that the Senate can do its job properly and scrutinise the legislation that has come into this parliament and not simply have it rushed through to appease the Greens so that they can beat their chests and say, 'Look at me. Look at me,' when they get to Durban, South Africa, this December.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  I have a question for the minister relating to section 5 of the bill. There is a prohibition in section 5 of the bill on using the student services fee for the support of a political party or for the election of a person as a member of a legislature of a Commonwealth, state, territory or local government body. My friend Senator Ryan discuss this yesterday, you may recall Madam Temporary Chairman.</span>

                    </a>  Could the minister inform the Senate as to what type of activity is prohibited under this provision? Is it to be strictly read—being money contributed to a fund used by a candidate for their election or to a fund controlled by a political party—or should the provision be read rather more loosely as activity which could or tends to influence the way a voter may vote in an election?</span>

I understand that funds cannot be used to support the election of a candidate for a political party. I appreciate that. In effect, as I understand it, it means that an organisation which receives funds pursuant to this bill cannot, for example, support a Labor, Liberal or National Party candidate. I accept that but can it support a political cause? For example, the Work Choices campaign is not a political party.</span>

To say 'I do not believe so' is no good. You need to a stronger statement than that. Your belief is not an adequate assurance to this chamber that compulsorily collected funds from all students across Australia will not be used and abused to fund political campaigns irrespective of whether the people who are forced to pay the tax support the cause being prosecuted. The point that Senator Mason has raised is very important because the qualification around not being able to use these funds to support the election of a candidate to the Commonwealth parliament or various other is very narrow. The way we read it on this side of the chamber is that it will not prevent the abuse of those funds collected from students across Australia being used and abused to fund political campaigns including those campaigns not support by a great majority of students across Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should students across Australia be forced by this government to fund political campaigns and political causes whether it be a cause in favour of Labor's bad carbon tax or a cause against any number of campaigns that may come up on campus from time to time? Of course, all students are free to join those causes; all students are free to contribute their own personal funds to those causes, as long as it is of their own free will and accord. The more general question I have for the government is this: what have you got against freedom? What have you got against freedom of association? Why do you want to force students across Australia to sign up to causes they do not support? Why should students across Australia not be free to make their own choices as to whether or not they want to contribute their own funds to a particular cause? These are very import­ant issues and, quite frankly, the protections in this legislation against the abuse of student funds by having them used towards political campaigns are completely inadequate and they should be strengthened.</span>

Let me point to this example: take proposed subsection (4)(f) about 'promoting the health or welfare of students'. Now, taking promot­ing the welfare of students, what is to stop a student group saying, 'We have to support the carbon tax because that promotes the welfare of students'? I am sure you follow the argument, Minister, and that is the problem here: this list is so broad and so crudely drafted that it really does not limit student expenditure at all.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  So why is it then that the government's chief tax collectors, repre­sented by the Chief Executive Officer of Universities Australia, told the Senate committee inquiring into this bill that they cannot guarantee that money would not go to the National Union of Students? That is the evidence we were given. Your chief tax collectors cannot provide a guarantee that the money would not find its way to the National Union of Students and, of course, we all know the highly political track record of the National Union of Students. We know what the National Union of Students has done in the past. We know what the National Union of Students is likely to do in the future. Again I stress that I encourage the National Union of Students to pursue all of the causes they want, but students across Australia should not be forced to make sacrifices to fund—so financially struggling students across Australia should not be forced to fund—the political activities of the National Union of Students. Even your chief tax collectors effectively say, as Senator Mason said earlier, that you can drive a truck through the sorts of commitments that the minister has just made that no money will end up there unless it provides services. That is just not true. It brings me again to a broader question. What is wrong with voluntary student unionism? What is wrong with freedom of association? What is wrong with the principle that students should only be required to pay for the services they actually access? What is wrong with service providers on campuses being required to be responsive to the genuine needs of students? Why should services on campus have this overall blanket over them where they do not have to worry about what students want or need because they have got the guaranteed cash flow, courtesy of this latest Labor Party tax grab? What is wrong with a circumstance where we have got services on campus that are responsive to genuine student needs and students are paying for the services they want to access and are not paying for everything else—not paying for political campaigns? What is wrong with that? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the minister whether she has actually assessed and reviewed the experiences in my home state of Western Australia, where in that great state we had students, for the longest period of time, being able to benefit from freedom of association and students being able to benefit from the tax cuts that were delivered to them by successive coalition governments—first, by the Court government at a state level and then by the Howard government at a federal level. Has she looked at what has happened to the provision of services on campus at the University of Western Australia and various other universities? The quality of service provision and the take-up rate dramatically improved. Instead of this sky-will-fall-in scenario that Labor senators are painting—where, supposedly, student unions and clubs collapse when there is no compulsory tax—services and unions on the campuses in Western Australia continue to thrive. Yes, they had to adjust their so-called business model. Yes, they had to start to worry about what it was that students were looking for—they could not just ignore the demand for services as they existed on campus—and be responsive to genuine student needs. That is a good thing, I would have thought. Why should we go back to the bad old days where all students across Australia were slugged with a tax to fund the idiosyncrasies of a few? That is not appropriate. Yet this is what we are getting, again, from this ideological, tax-grabbing Labor government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students across Australia need to under­stand that under a coalition government they would pay less, under a coalition government they would be more free and under a coalition government they would have freedom of association—all the things that this Labor-Green coalition government is proposing to take away from them with this legislation. I want to know from the minister—and she has not responded to this before—what this government has got against the concept of freedom of asso­ciation. Why does this government want to force students to be part of causes they do not support? Why does this government want to force students to fund campaigns that they do not support? What was wrong with the campuses in Western Australia where there was a period of 13 or 14 years of freedom of association? Are you really suggesting that student services in Western Australia are inadequate or nonexistent? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I point to one particular piece of evidence from Ms Drakeford from the National Union of Students when she sought to criticise voluntary student unionism. She said, 'The Australian National University’s gym membership has gone up by 500 per cent since VSU.' That is terrible, isn't it! Because we now have voluntary student unionism, students actually choose that they want to join a gym. They are prepared to pay a fee to join a gym. Gym membership has gone up by 500 per cent. How terrible that students across Australia are no longer funding access to gym services for those who go! How terrible that students not going to the gym are no longer funding access to the gym for those who do! That is a terrible thing! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, this government was complaining that the price of coffee has gone up, the price of drinks at the bar has gone up, the price of food has gone up—and now people have to join the gym. How terrible. The only way you can stop that is by forcing a whole bunch of students who are not going to access those services to pay for those who do! Why is that right? Why is that the way that this government wants to go? It is not as if we are talking about rich people; we are talking about students. We are talking about students who work week in and week out to make ends meet, and this government wants to slug them with another tax. It is complete­ly inappropriate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again to students across Australia who are listening to this debate: this Labor-Green government wants to take your freedom of association away, this Labor-Green government wants to slug you with another tax and this Labor-Green govern­ment is quite happy for your money to be used to fund causes and services which you do not support. We on the coalition side of the parliament think that is highly inappro­priate. That is really the crux of the matter. I am interested in your answer to my various questions, Minister.</span>

The provisions in subsection (4) of the Higher Education Legislation Amend­ment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2010 have been designed to eliminate the very concerns that the opposition are raising about political activity to focus expenditure on services and amenities, and this is why the Group of Eight have support­ed these measures. This bill is designed to allow for the better provision of student services and amenities. It has been broadly canvassed and takes into account the experiences across universities, across Australia, across the board. That is why, other than the oppo­sition, these measures are broadly supported.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I have not had the opportunity to join this debate until now, but I do want to take up some of the matters that have been raised most eloquently by my colleagues, both in the second reading debate and in committee. What is glaringly obvious from listening to this debate from my room on and off over the last two days is the utter philosophical hypocrisy of the government—absolute philosophical hypocrisy. I assume that their partners and the other end here, the real government in this country, will be joining them on this matter. That is the real philosophical hypocrisy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, the parliamentary secretary has not given one ounce of confidence to anyone in relation to the abuse of these funds in her answers to Senators Mason and Cormann. The problems are big enough for a truck to be driven through. We know from past experience that organisations such as the National Union of Students are going to do whatever is required to ensure that they get hold of this money. They get hold of this money to support the Australian Labor Party, and what the Australian Labor Party has done with this legislation is to pull out from underneath the feet of all Australian students their right to freedom of choice in the expenditure of these funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What you have done is the most appalling part of this debate. The Australian Labor Party have done this because the National Union of Students for decades was a third or fourth arm of the Australian Labor Party. It is not appropriate to argue that there are sufficient provisions in this legislation protecting students from the misuse of their funds. There is not sufficient protection. Anyone looking at this legislation, as Senator Mason said, could drive a truck through it. The Australian Labor Party knows, we know and the Greens know that it will be used against the coalition in support of the Australian Labor Party and the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is not the fundamental issue. The issue is not about whether it is to support the Labor Party against the conservative part of the community; it is about freedom of choice. On what basis does the Australian Labor Party force Australian students to pay money for services which they do not use? On what basis does the Australian Labor Party have a philosophical right to demand that of students? The only fair philosophical position in relation to this debate is for freedom of choice to remain, for there to be voluntary student unionism, because every­thing else is the antithesis of what we in this place should believe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot sit there, Parliamentary Secretary, and argue that a loose form of words is giving protection against abuse of these funds because no-one looking at the legislation we will believe it. Even a bush lawyer can see that there is no protection in this legislation. I do not think that anything you have said today to Senator Mason, Senator Bernardi, Senator Cormann or others would give any confidence at all in relation to this matter. Clearly, Parliamentary Secre­tary, you need to answer the questions properly that were put today. For example, you have not answered Senator Cormann's question about NUS expenditure. Answer the questions that have been put to you today, because if you do not it is just a further example of a philosophical cover-up on this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from the National Union of Students and the Australian Labor Party, I do not know anyone who is legitimately opposed to voluntary student unionism or voluntary student payments. How could anyone be against those voluntary payments? It does not stand up to the philosophical test. It does not pass muster in relation to what is reasonable. Again, I look at the great cohort of students in this country, particularly regional and rural students and particularly the children of working families. On what basis does the Australian Labor Party demand of them a compulsory fee? On what basis does the Australian Labor Party demand of working families and regional and rural students a fee over which they have no choice and for which they will have, in the most part, no use? On what basis do you justify that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have sold your own alleged constituency down the drain on this matter. Surely it is the students and their parents who make a decision about the expenditure of the family funds. It is the families who must be allowed to make that decision, not the Australian Labor Party to support one of its largest branches—namely the National Union of Students. This is about supporting a branch of the ALP. It is not about supporting regional or rural Australians. It is not about supporting struggling families, working families—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  The concerns of many in the coalition, most recently articulated by Senator Ronaldson, come back to this issue of the welfare of students. I seek a broader response from the Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations. How are we to interpret the words in clause 19-38(4)(f) of this bill: 'promoting the health or welfare of students'? You can draw a long bow and extrapolate health into many much needed areas, and the welfare of students is certainly a very subjective task. Some would say that engaging in political agendas, as Senator Mason has highlighted, is about enhancing the welfare of students, whether they be current students or future students. Some would say that the opposition to this compulsory tax on students is in fact acting in the welfare of students, so would students and student unions be able to put their funds in and campaign, for example, against this government which is seeking to tax every student, whether or not they actually engage in the services that are available on campus?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am drawn to the dichotomy that, on one hand, the Prime Minister said earlier this week that she believes in individualism and rejects collectivism and that the choices of individuals are very important, but, on the other hand, has had introduced into this place this week a bill which rejects entirely the individual choice of students. It is applying a tax of $250 on students, overall a tax of about $250 million, which will make their lives more difficult. I say more difficult because, financially, it is a struggle—many students do not have $250 to pluck out of thin air. It is a week's work for many casual students—it can be applied to their HECS bill but if they do that it becomes a greater burden later on. We know that delayed gratification is a good thing, but delaying the repayment of debts is not a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The welfare of students, that catch-all phrase, is open to an enormous amount of abuse. The challenge for the parliamentary secretary is to highlight the areas which the government considers are appropriate for this money to be expanded upon for the welfare of students. It is incumbent upon us to highlight our concerns and have them ruled out specifically by the government. I suspect that it will not be able to do that. That is not a reflection upon the minister's competence, but upon the drafting of this bill. You have to understand, and I think the Australian people understand, judging by the feedback that comes into the Twitter stream, that students are concerned. I do not read what people write about me on Twitter, but Senator Mason has certainly been getting many favourable comments on Twitter from students who are concerned about how this will impact on their lives. They are not concerned about the $250 specifically, although that will be a burden, but about the greater concerns of potential misuse and abuse for people who might consider themselves victims of on-campus actions. That will be the challenge and it is why I put to you, Parliamentary Secretary, the question: are you able to determine in a very specific manner, perhaps you could even table, a list of approved activities that would be determined to be for the welfare of students? If you are unable to do that, perhaps you could provide us with a number of examples that would clarify the phrase. These are very genuine concerns that have been articulated in a number of areas and which are held not just by the coalition but by hundreds of thousands of students across this great land. It is for them that we are raising these issues. We want to protect not only their financial pocketbooks but the integrity of the use of their funds. There is no denying that there has been misuse of student union funds in the past. That has been demonstrated, categorised and catalogued extensively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time I have left I do not need to elaborate too much further on that, save to say that when compulsory student unionism and amenities fees was abolished by what was an excellent government—most Austra­lians would confirm that, given the current state of affairs of this nation—there were a lot of happy students. Those who decried and said that student life would be diminished or fail have been proven wrong again and again. We could draw parallels with other sorts of policies, but I will not. I will confine myself to this issue, which is the welfare of students. So, Parliamentary Secretary, I ask whether you are able to provide me and the people listening, the many students who are following this debate, with a definition of 'welfare of students', with some examples of how it would be inappropriate to spend money under the guise of the welfare of students and some examples of how it would be appropriate to spend money on the welfare of students. I have given you plenty of time to take appropriate advice, so I would like a full and complete answer to my very genuine concerns.</span>

Aside from that, we could continue to debate at great length the philosophy of applying user charges. I do not think that there is any point in that, other than to say that it is the government's view that an education provider can seek to gather resources in order to deliver certain types of student services and amenities as opposed to political activity, and that is what this bill seeks to do.</span>

                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise today to draw attention to some of the recent remarks of the Prime Minister, especially the EMILY's List Oration and 15th<span style="color:gray;"></span>birthday that we marked last week. The address that the Prime Minister gave to the Chifley Research Centre was entitled 'Labor in Australia is a movement'. I wish to recognise the importance of the decisions and the depth of the words the Prime Minister has delivered in recent weeks. While I do so as a member of the party led by the Prime Minister, as a supporter and as a colleague, I also do so equally as an Australian citizen who believes very strongly that the office of Prime Minister is one deserving of esteem and respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am, I would presume like all Senators here, an avowed democrat with an interest in the history of the development of democracy in this country. In my short time thus far as a senator in this place, having had the opportunity to explore Canberra, I have been reminded that the role of parliament and government in this country has and continues to be central to the creation of a prosperous nation—a prosperous Australia. Our leaders, and we senators, all have a great responsi­bility, I believe, to lead as well as represent. Our words and deeds, especially those of the Prime Minister, are written into the fabric of our society, just as the words of our past leaders are inscribed on our national monu­ments and their deeds are reflected in the grand institutions of this city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These marks that are etched into history, which remain relevant to any Australian of any time, necessarily speak to not just policy and the issues of the day but also the approach that those leaders have taken in their role at the most fundamental level. They speak to the most basic values that have guided the decisions of government and, in turn, guided the direction of Australian society. The enduring influence of these values is not always evident and not always discussed in the cut and thrust of the daily 24-hour news cycle or in the debates with which we most often occupy ourselves in this place. While sometimes the discourse of this chamber and the very great volume of our extra-parliamentary debate simply does not reflect that rich tradition and those great moments of change in Australian society, and although it is easy to be drawn into conversations of negativity, criticism or, worst of all, trivia, it is the case that great words and substantial deeds do still play a role in Australia's development. They do still play a role in Australian government. And we do have the fortune of having a leader of this country who carries the dignity of her office, who is committed to dealing with important things and who considers the values that will bear her and our mark on history—Labor values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Tuesday, 13 September, the Prime Minister gave the inaugural EMILY's List Oration. EMILY's List is a movement designed to support progressive Labor women in achieving office. It is an organisa­tion which has enabled me, like so many other women on this side of the chamber, to take the opportunities of election that women were so long denied and where women are still underrepresented. The Prime Minister's speech was a reflection on the history of the women's movement and the extraordinary challenges that have been confronted and defeated by women who were determined, practical and brave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The drivers of change have been women who held firm to their values but never detached them from the real tasks and actual situations of women in politics and in society. Their result—the signal of the success of the women's movement—has, in the words of the Prime Minister, been in 'taking the remarkable and rendering it unremarkable'. It is important, I think, to dwell on that sentence a short time. What it means is that whatever progress we make—and we have made considerable progress—we must remember that we always had to work hard. Those women and men, those leaders and ordinary people who believed in the right to the vote, to decent work, to fair pay and to a proper share of life's opportu­nities always had to strive to achieve what we can sometimes take for granted today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's oration was a reminder that there is still so much work to be done, that we cannot become complacent by assuming either that the task is done or that progress is inevitable. It never has been and it never will be, and we must be active in stamping out inequality wherever it exists in our society. I strongly support the Prime Minister's comments—comments which reflect the principles on which the Labor Party has always been based and by which Labor members like me have stirred and agitated and insisted. That is why the Labor Party are the party of reform and why the Labor Party fight for equality rather than sitting back and hoping that opportunity will simply trickle down against a backdrop of inequity, poverty or patriarchy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This approach is captured in the title of another of the significant speeches the Prime Minister gave last week, 'Labor in Australia is a movement'. This was an address to the Chifley Research Centre, where again the Prime Minister made reference to Curtin's courage, which kept us free in times of war, and Chifley's convictions, which built a nation. I draw that to the attention of senators in this place, as I did in my first speech, because it is the values of Labor which guide us and which were reflected last week in those two significant addresses by the Prime Minister, both the EMILY's List Oration and the address to the Chifley Research Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are the values that will guide us into the future—the values of equality, oppor­tunity and respect for difference amongst us—as well as the recognition at all times that it is through the struggles of leaders past and present for those values that we find ourselves here today. They are the values that guide us as Labor senators and members and will guide us into the future. We need to hold dear those Labor values that, at a time when the news media are very much focused on negativity in regard to the issues of the day, do not bear the light they should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are faced each day with the task of judging the public and the national interest; weighing public desires and perceptions, and expert advice; dealing with new challenges and unpredictable circum­stances; and dealing with situations in which the intentions and motivations of our leaders cannot always be fully expressed or achieved. In these situations, in the everyday administration and on the most momentous of occasions, our decisions are filtered through the prism of our values, and it is only fair that, in a democracy, our citizens know what those values are and on what basis we are acting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our vision for a better Australia is likely common to all in this place, although our values and approaches to government are often starkly different. I am proud that Australia has a Prime Minister who is willing to clearly articulate her values, whose values I share and whose values will reverberate not just through the halls and places in Canberra where speeches are made but also through the legacy of action with which they are imbued.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  My comments will dovetail quite neatly with those of Senator Singh, because the issues that I would like to speak of go very strongly to issues of equality as well—not just income or gender equality but asset equality. Of course, I am speaking about housing and housing affordability, because it is one of the things that many of us take for granted in Australia, and this has come from our history: we believe housing is a human right. Having a roof over your head and having sustainable and affordable tenure is something that we in Australia think of as a right. In the minds of many, housing has become just another asset class, just another property to be bought and sold in the great game of Monopoly. A number of trends have pushed it in this direction, and those two agendas are completely at odds. If you are an investor and you are looking for capital appreciation at a rate that is as high as possible, eight or 10 per cent a year, that is quite clearly going to completely contradict the aspirations of many people for affordable housing and for some stability in the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcomed the launch of the Australians for Affordable Housing campaign in this building on Monday. This is a coalition of over 60 national housing, welfare and community sector organisations who are calling on all levels of government to make the changes necessary to ensure that all Australians can find an affordable home. This is a group that is saying, loud and clear, that the problem of housing affordability has gone on for too long. Plenty of people have noticed it. The Australian government has noticed it. The opposition has noticed it. But it seems intractable. It is time to fix our housing system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is needed is a clear national plan to deliver affordable housing to all Australians, and the Australians for Affordable Housing alliance offer a six-point plan that goes directly to the heart of what is wrong with our housing system right now. The first thing that they ask for is investment in more low-cost rental housing, because the housing debate in Australia is skewed towards home­ownership. Obviously, homeownership is something that we in the Australian Greens support, and it is great for the people who can get into the market, but what about those who cannot? What about the entire gener­ation of people who have simply been priced out of homeownership? We also tend to forget the fact that so many people rent. Between 1996 and 2007, the number of affordable public housing properties shrank by 32,000, while the population grew by 2.8 million people. This is despite the record one-off $5.6 billion spend on social housing as part of the stimulus package which will deliver around 20,000 new social housing dwellings. We supported that initiative. I think it was one of the better parts of the stimulus package that the government, with the concurrence of the Greens, sought to make investments in public housing. It solved an issue in the building sector and got people back to work, but it also started to fill this enormous gap in unmet need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for social housing, Mark Arbib, said earlier this year in a speech that there was underinvestment of $3.1 billion by the previous government in social housing. He noted that the current housing shortfall was 90,000 homes, with 60,000 households in greatest need. That gap will rise to 150,000 by 2020, and the cost to meet that shortfall is $24 billion. But the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness, who presides over 105,000 homeless people, says that the government does not have the money. There is no plan, there is no proposal, to plug that shortfall of $24 billion. He says it is up to the affordable housing sector to build it, it is up to the community housing sector, it is up to investors. He wants to leave it to the market to fix a market failure and chronic underinvestment by successive governments. The problem with this thinking—and the fear of government intervention that it seems to embody—is that the housing market is broken. It is not operating efficiently at the moment—unless you have six investment properties; then you would be doing reasonably well out of the increases in the housing market that have occurred over a decade or so. This is why we need long-term planning, funding and targets for social housing as a proportion of all stock based on housing need. The stimulus spend was absolutely welcome, but even the government and the minister concerned have acknowledged that it does not go nearly far enough because our private rental sector is partly what is out of control. The current gap is around 493,000 affordable and available rental dwellings for low-income earners. In the past five years, rents have risen at twice the rate of inflation. They have almost tripled in capital cities around Australia in the last decade. At the last census, 65 per cent of renters were experiencing housing stress and the next census will no doubt see this figure rise dramatically. We cannot just sit back while this happens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in our mining regions the boom has amounted to an unbelievable boom in rental prices. We think things are out of control in Canberra, Sydney and central Perth, but the median rent in Karratha and Port Hedland in Western Australia is now $1,500 to $1,700 a week. The rent in Gladstone in Queensland jumped 15 per cent in a year, and the situation is worsening as well in the so-called 'muscle towns' of Mackay and Townsville in Queensland and Whyalla in South Australia. So the people on the front line who are meant to be benefiting from the mining boom are actually doing the worst. Boom times come with a desperate shortage of housing to buy and rent. The only people who can afford to live in some of these communities now are people who are being subsidised by their employers. That is pricing key workers out of the market and it is making homelessness vastly worse. In the boom towns of the north-west—and I presume it is exactly the same in Queens­land—Aboriginal people and long-term residents of those communities can no longer afford to live there. They are flying in and flying out people to clean schools in Karratha and Dampier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second ask of the housing coalition that was launched this week is for financial assistance for low-income renters. This is probably the simplest and most obvious case to make. The current rates of Commonwealth rent assistance are simply nowhere near enough. In the last ten years, rent assistance has risen by about nine per cent, or $35, while rents across all major cities have increased by at least five per cent per year. So we are falling behind rapidly. In the last three years in Perth, rent for a two-bedroom unit rose by $100 a week, a lift of 40 per cent, at the same time as CRA is crawling upwards very slowly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A single student who earns $377 a fortnight on Austudy gets an extra $119 a week in rent assistance. That is an income of $248 a week, yet median rents in capital cities are now $380. That leaves $58 for everything else. National Shelter and ACOSS have called for a 30 per cent increase across the board and for assistance to be pegged to regional rent variations. The Henry tax review calls for maximum rates of rent assistance for income support recipients to be substantially increased and linked to movements in market rents. It is essential that Commonwealth rent assistance pays some regard to what is happening in the rental market. Addressing the inequity and the gravity of the problem with our rent assistance is well overdue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third and fourth asks by the housing coalition are for more opportunities for low-income households and first homeowners to access home ownership. Particularly for people trying to get in as first home buyers, generational inequity has emerged in that the housing market has become warped beyond all recognition just in time for people of my age and younger to find themselves comple­tely locked out of the market. The income simply is not there. Hearing all these demands by big business for labour market flexibility makes it very difficult to contem­plate taking out a 20- or 30-year loan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past decade, house prices have risen dramatically and have torn away from modest gains in income. The average house now costs seven times the average worker's wage. This is not how the situation was when people of my parents' generation were getting into the housing market for the first time. Even ten years ago it only cost four times the average worker's wage. In my home state, the median house price in the capital, Perth, was $535,617 in the June quarter. Prices are down two to three per cent recently, but that needs to be seen against the backdrop of a 222 per cent increase in Perth in the last decade. It is completely unrealistic for investors to think that that kind of capital appreciation can continue without warping the market beyond recognition. It is unsus­tainable, it cannot continue and it is strongly disadvantaging younger people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2011 Bankwest Key Worker Housing Affordability survey showed 78 per cent of capital city local council areas were too expensive for key workers to buy a house in 2010. While we are used to having to deal with the idea of people in the lowest income quintiles not being able to afford houses anywhere near the areas where they work, this is affecting key workers and people on what we would consider to be medium incomes. The same report showed that not one of Perth's 291 suburbs is affordable to key workers, including people like teachers and nurses. Something is clearly and devastatingly wrong when key workers cannot afford to live anywhere in the city. Something is also wrong when only the very wealthy or people who are prepared to live further and further over the horizon at the edge of cities can even contemplate buying their own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government response has been a demand stimulus, a handout to inflate the price of housing in the form of the $7,000 first home owners grant that has cost the country $13 billion to date. It is inflationary, regressive and despised by countless econo­mists, except unfortunately those in Treas­ury, who refuse to do any modelling on the impact of just handing over money which then passes straight through to an increase in house prices. What could have been done with $13 billion in genuine housing affordability initiatives or in help for people to get into their first home? For the same amount, we could have seen 43,000 actual houses built or 1.3 million National Rental Affordability Scheme incentives to increase supply rather than inflate prices as people bid up house prices without doing anything to increase supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other incentives like the First Home Savers scheme and shared equity schemes are much more responsible and effective. WA is leading the way in some of these things—in a tentative way, but they are there with a shared equity scheme. Cooperative housing and community land trust models must also be given their time to shine. Maybe the era of fewer and fewer people living in larger and larger houses on the fringes of our great cities is coming to an end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing coalition also have called for a change in the housing investment tax arrangements that drive up house prices. We are seeing investors crowding into the market, bidding up house prices against people trying to purchase their first home, and it is putting enormous distortions into the rental market as well. The Australian tax system provides the largest source of subsidy for housing consumption. Anyone interested in these impacts should read chapter 4 of <span style="font-style:italic;">A good house is hard to find: h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ousing affordability in Australia</span>, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia, which my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert made a huge contribution towards. Alternatively, they should read the sections on housing in the Henry tax review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate select committee investigated factors influencing the demand for housing and reported that the combined total of capital gains tax arrangements, land tax exemptions, negative gearing arrangements and so on is of the order of $50 billion per year. That is spread across the Common­wealth and state systems—$50 billion a year in concessions while we are spending something of the order of $2 billion or $3 billion a year on genuine housing afforda­bility initiatives across the country. The Greens have recognised this for many years. It is not a secret—the housing affordability peak bodies have been pointing this out for literally a decade or two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are an outlier in terms of how gener­ous our taxation system is towards housing owners, investors and even speculators. There are many more people who would stand to benefit from improving the fairness of our tax system and moving our investment towards affordable rental supply than there are people who would potentially lose out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My final ask is about a subject that is a real bugbear for me and it is something that I have consistently raised since the last election because I find the government's reasoning absolutely incomprehensible. One of the lesser discussed impacts of the last election was the loss of a dedicated housing minister. We now have a machinery of government, for housing, that is just a scrambled egg—it is just a bowl of spaghetti—if you are trying to work out who is responsible for which parts of the housing portfolio. I do not understand why the environment minister is now responsible for housing affordability. I have asked many times why the portfolio was demolished and nobody is able to give me a sensible answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Minister for Housing, Tanya Plibersek, was the first dedicated housing minister in Australia—certainly in recent political history. That was a key demand of the Greens in the run-up to the 2007 election. The Australian government responded to that and we got a housing minister who was competent, effective and compassionate. Australians deserve to have one person and one ministry responsible for providing safe, secure and affordable housing. This is not a comment on any of the ministers, like Senator Arbib, who suddenly found that housing was part of their portfolio. He is doing his very best with the resources that he has, but I do not think it is clearly understood, even in government, who is responsible for which bits of the portfolio. This is a key request of ours and I believe it is shared by the coalition. Certainly Senator Marise Payne has done an enormous amount of work on these issues. Just bring it back into a single portfolio so that we know where responsibility lies. Without a dedicated minister, I think there is very little hope for a housing strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The launch of the Australians for Affordable Housing campaign on Monday was, I think, the beginning of a very import­ant conversation that we need to have in Australia to make sure that Common­wealth and state housing spending, and the way our tax system is structured, is not regressive—that it genuinely helps people to get into homes. Whether it is getting renters stable and secure tenure, getting first homeowners into homes or allowing people to move from one home to another without being beaten to death with stamp duty, there are so many issues that we need to take on. Let us get on with it.</span>

The latest Newspoll released in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> shows that their primary support base has slumped to 26 per cent.

                  </a>  You see—you just scratch the surface a little and those sitting on the other side get very agitated about this. We have seen a historic level of government incompetence and mismanagement which has seen billions of dollars of Australians taxpayers' money flushed down the toilet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the surplus that was left by the former Howard-Costello government, Treas­urer Wayne Swan went on a spending spree in the pursuit of stimulating the economy. We have acknowledged that the purpose of it was to—in his words—'stimulate the econ­omy'. But he did it seemingly without any consideration for value for money or long-term benefits for Australia. I remind this chamber—with Senator Mason here, because he has prosecuted the case very effectively in this chamber—about the waste and misman­agement and total lack of consideration in formulating the so-called Building the Education Revolution. That program saw a focus on flash new school halls—sparkling amenities—but no real public policy consideration of how that would actually raise the education levels of our kids. It has not raised education standards and we have seen that in the recent results. It has had no impact on the education standards achieved by Australian students.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget the Green Loans scheme and the pink batts debacle. We are still paying for that debacle and there are still to this day many households with electrified roofs. Then there is the shambolic way in which they are still dealing with the asylum seeker crisis. We discuss in this chamber every day this appalling state where we have a flotilla of boats coming to this country, and it is costing taxpayers an extra billion dollars a year just to maintain the status quo without actually fixing the problem. We are not going to the root of the problem—we have a continuing crisis in this area and the whole thing is being dealt with in a shambolic way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, one can only congratulate the Treasurer for this accolade given the extraordinary financial recklessness of this government. What a great achievement it is. I would encourage those listening to this broadcast today to google the recipients of <span style="font-style:italic;">Euromoney</span> honours. It makes for interesting reading. We find former awardees include corporations such as Lehman Brothers who, as we know, went belly up in 2007, taking the hard-earned cash of many Americans with them. It was the largest bankruptcy in US history. So the Treasurer, in being given this award, is amongst very distinguished company. The global financial services firm Morgan Stanley and the megabank Citigroup have both received honourable mentions, and yet they were bailed out by the US govern­ment in the latter stages to prevent their collapse. Whilst I would not suggest I am any soothsayer, I do not think that the Treasurer is necessarily standing in very good company.</span>

In addition to the Assistant Treasurer, they could have considered the US Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner. He is facing the challenge of finding no less than US$3 trillion, at current exchange rates around A$2.9 trillion, in new deficit cuts to make sure that the US credit rating will not be downgraded any further. Then we have Giulio Tremonti, the incum­bent Italian finance minister who has presided over that country's credit rating downgrading. Italy, as we know, currently carries a public debt of €1.9 trillion, or A$2.56 trillion, a portion of which must be refunded each year through the sale of government bonds. Then we have the Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who is staring down the barrel of the financial gun and relies on the agreement of the Euro­pean Union to ensure that the Greek econo­my does not experience a total collapse.</span>

So, compared with the rest of the world, Australia is indeed a fortunate country, with its continuing mining boom, but we must not take the situation for granted or be complacent. Our current circumstances do not mean that this government should think it can have an open chequebook for the things it is trying to ram through this parliament, including the introduction of a carbon tax. Our current circumstances should not be taken for granted, and it is the responsibility of this government to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to increase Australia's productivity, particularly in the manufact­uring and service industries. </span>

Those on the other side have been getting a bit agitated about the due deference paid to former Treasurers who actually understood how to grow surpluses. It took Peter Costello 10 years to pay back that $96 billion of Labor debt that had been ratcheted up so easily during the Hawke-Keating years. The recipient of this award should be the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, who knew what it meant to apply financial discipline and responsibility to the task. That provided the basis for the current economic situation that the government enjoys. <span style="font-style:italic;">Euromoney</span> magazine has commen­ded Mr Swan for his careful stewardship of Australia's finances and economic perform­ance, both during and since the global financial crisis.

                <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Swan can claim credit for recognising the threat of the global financial crisis and responding quickly, particularly through cash injections, to stave off recession. However, much of the later rounds of stimulus spending was ill-targeted, poorly administered and unproductive. The resources boom, fuelled by continued Chinese demand, the rapid depreciation of the dollar via our floating currency and the aggressive easing of monetary policy by the Reserve Bank, as well as the stability of our financial sector, insulated us from the worst of the crisis.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not read too much in that about the contribution that the Treasurer has given to this whole situation. While we know that this government will take the credit for anything, and if I was them I probably would too, given their appalling track record on the governance of so much since they have been in office, recognition must be directed to the former government's handling of the economy and to former Treasurer Peter Costello for the way in which he set up this country so that it ensured us some protection against any vulnerabilities or unstable global economic challenges. The Treasurer, Wayne Swan, has presented us with fudgy budgets. He has promised to return the budget to surplus while borrowing $135 million a day to service the current debt. That is $135 million a day that every taxpayer will have to pay back before a single cent is saved for the government in the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the categorical ruling out of 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' by Prime Minister Gillard, we know how committed the Labor government is to its election promises. We know what it does with its pledges: it bins them. It has no credit and integrity in this regard whatsoever. The answer to this government's financial irre­sponsibility, and its total spending spree, is to raise more money by introducing more taxes. We see this again now and we will see it with the mining tax, which is the next thing the government wants to bring on the agenda.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7Y6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CROSSIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  It was with immense pride a few weeks ago that I helped to welcome our troops back to Australia and also took part with our community in the opening of a new memorial to our veterans in the heart of Palmerston. On Saturday 3 September we witnessed a magnificent sight when hundreds of service men and women marched through the streets of Darwin, welcomed back by thousands of friends, family and members of our very supportive Top End community. The Australian Army Band Darwin provided the marching music as the seemingly endless line of troops moved from The Esplanade down Mackey Street. Joining the troops on parade was Digger, the riderless horse, with boots in the stirrups that, in accordance with tradition, are pointing to the rear, which represents the fallen soldiers, not marching with their comrades but not forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the marching troops rolled the armoured fighting vehicles that provide a symbolic example of their vital overwatch, direct fire, and protective work on opera­tions. This was an impressive sight but it was also a real buzz for the families and the children lining the streets, waving Territory and Australian flags and dressed in yellow T-shirts, provided by the Northern Territory government, that said 'Welcome Home'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ADF was represented at the welcome home parade by the Chief of the Army, Lieutenant General David Morrison AO—and I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate him on his appointment and say I enjoyed immensely the opportunity that I had on that day to chat with him about his new role—also, the Commander of the 1st Division, Major General Rick Burr DSC, AM, MVO and the Commander of the 1st Brigade—a great friend of Darwin and the Top End's Defence community—Brigadier Fergus McLachlan AM, ADC. These three very distinguished leaders of our armed forces joined local, Territory and federal representatives in welcoming home approximately 1,300 of our troops who have recently finished their overseas operational service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their distinguished service included operations in Afghanistan as part of the Mentoring Task Force 2. This task force was made up of engineers, mechanised infantry and cavalry from Darwin based units. MTF 2 made an invaluable contribution to security in Oruzgan by patrolling further and support­ing more Afghan National Army—ANA—elements than any other previous task force. These partnering operations and mentoring will enable the ANA to take increasing responsibility for security in their own country. There was also the Artillery Train­ing Team, Kandahar, who have been training members of the ANA in artillery and the required numeracy and literacy that is needed to perform the task of an artillery operator. Also included was the combined team in Oruzgan, which is part of the team running operations led by the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, based in that province. There were also troops from Special Operations Task Groups 13 and 14, which included members of the Darwin based 1st Armoured Regiment. We also welcomed home the members of Force Communications Unit 4, who were support­ing operations in Afghanistan with vital communications links.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of the troops being welcomed home had been serving in Afghanistan. However, the parade also provided an opportunity to welcome home members of Australian Security Detachment 17, who were guarding the Australian Embassy and embassy staff in Baghdad, Iraq. We also welcomed back members of Timor-Leste Task Group 2, including soldiers from the Darwin based 1st Combat Engineer Regiment and our fantastic Active Australian Army Reserves from reserve units throughout Australia. Again, task groups need communications, and Force Communi­cations Element 4, made up of members of our Darwin based 1st Combat Signals Regiment, was also welcomed home after serving in Timor-Leste, our close neighbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The march was very well attended. There was almost a carnival atmosphere as people lined the streets and applauded constantly. They were so proud of the display of the service men and women from our Defence Force. I want to place on record my thanks to the Darwin City Council for the immense work that was undertaken in organising and hosting this parade and the great reception for some of the members of the Defence Forces and their families after the parade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The following day—the Sunday—we headed out to Palmerston, where hundreds turned out to again welcome home the troops, in particular the 1st Brigade troops, who are based at Robertson Barracks—or Robbo Barracks, as we call them locally. This also involved the dedication of Palmerston Memorial Park, featuring the newly installed memorial walls. The guard was provided by the 1st Armoured Regi­ment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Scott Winter. The regiment is to be congrat­ulated on its fine drill and professional turnout on that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of reading a message from the Prime Minister expressing our nation's thanks for the efforts of the troops and paying special tribute to Corporal Richard Atkinson and Sapper Jamie Larcombe, who made the supreme sacrifice in Afghanistan. Their family members were present on that day, and I know that the community appreciated their presence. I hope they were reminded from that day of the support they get from a community such as Darwin during this horrific time of grief they are going through. These two 1st Brigade soldiers were killed in Afghanistan while serving with Mentoring Task Force 2, and another eight were wounded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the City of Palmerston for hosting this great occasion and to Mayor Robert McLeod for allocating the space for the memorial park and for acknowledging the millions of dollars the federal govern­ment has provided through various grants, which have produced great results for the Palmerston community. In fact, on that day we acknowledged $4,000 from the Depart­ment of Veterans' Affairs for the construct of the memorial walls, more than $2 million for local infrastructure in and around Palmer­ston, $70,000 for playground equipment for the Palmerston community and $62,000 for the upgrade of the memorial park—and I have to say, that wall just tops off the atmosphere generated in that space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mayor was persistent in previous months and years in pressuring us and insisting that we gift to the Palmerton City Council a retired Army Leopard tank, which now provides a great focus front and centre in that park. It signifies the close relationship between the city and the military. The memorial park has become a place where all of us in Palmerston can remember our troops—our friends and our fellow commu­nity members—who have served our nation, particularly those who have given their lives in the service of our nation. Their names, of course, were the first to be transcribed onto that memorial wall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the Deputy Mayor and master of ceremonies, Geoff Carter CSM, a great friend. Thanks also to Chaplain Michael Quested; the Australian Army Band and the Palmerston City Concert Band; the City of Palmerston elected members and officers; the Australian Navy Cadets; the police from the Palmerston station; St John Ambulance; and the hundreds of members of the Defence Force, the veteran community and the wider community, who were there with their proud family members and friends. They made these events such a special occasion and a special event for that weekend in Darwin and Palmerston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a recent memorial service at Robertson Barracks, 1st Brigade Commander Brigadier Gus McLachlan said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Today will be a very proud day for our soldiers, but it is also a day in which they will reflect on those who did not come home. Our thoughts go out to the families of those soldiers today, and to all service families who have been touched by war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these families was the family of Private Scott Palmer, and we were honoured by their attendance at the welcome home parades. Scott was one of the Australian commandos killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. His parents laid a wreath at the Palmerston memorial service. Scott grew up in Katherine and is now one of the Territory's greatest home-grown heroes. The fallen are eternally remembered in this place. As the Prime Minister said in her message to the returned troops, 'a grateful nation wishes you a well deserved respite.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are extremely proud of our Defence presence in Darwin and Palmerston. We are glad to have the troops back on home soil. The Defence presence is very significant indeed, and recent large-scale exercises and international visits reinforce this fact. The Navy, the Army and the Air Force all have significant establishments in Darwin and Palmerston, including Larrakeyah Barracks, Robertson Barracks, Defence Berrimah and the RAAF Base Darwin. Billions of dollars are spent in the Top End on defence, particu­larly on defence housing. The permanent live-in accommodation for single soldiers, sailors and airmen at Larrakeyah Barracks will soon be replaced with 230 new apart­ments onsite, and 97 new houses are underway in a separate $63.8 million project at Larrakeyah for Defence families. At Robertson Barracks, the 1st Brigade soldiers, many of whom we have just welcomed back, will not be missing out, with 680 apartments being built in the accommodation upgrade. Businesses across the Top End are benefiting significantly from the government's housing plan in Darwin, and these investments in Defence Housing in Darwin will provide more than 900 jobs for Territorians. Over 500 houses in the suburbs of Lyons and Bellamack have been completed, with more underway in the new and emerging suburbs of Johnston and Muirhead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reinforce this government's commitment to point out that Defence is such an integrated and appreciated part of our community and we are investing in improved conditions for single members and families to make their stay in the Territory as comfortable, as enjoyable and as long as possible. Defence contributes more than $800 million a year to the gross state product in the Northern Territory and stimulates an additional 4,500 non-Defence jobs in local business. Strategically important and valued in our community, our servicemen and servicewomen are integrated and apprecia­ted, and we continue to seek new ways to support our Defence families and members in the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With me here in the chamber today is Warrant Officer Gary Wight. I will not embarrass him and wish him happy birthday! Warrant Officer Wight has been in the Navy since 1987 and currently proudly serves on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Darwin</span>. He is with me in my office this week as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, a program which I wholeheartedly support. I have participated in it a number of times, probably not as successfully as I would have liked. It reinforced to me that I have chosen well in not having a career in the Defence Force. I am clearly the one who would lag behind each and every time—although I was pretty good at peeling three kilos of potatoes when I served on the patrol boat for a couple of days. That part I managed to do quite well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to reinforce how we value the work and the contribution that these service men and women provide in our community. To our returning troops, I say: welcome home. You are respected and appreciated, and I thank you for your service. As the Prime Minister said in her speech on that day, your courage, your dedication and your selfless service will not be forgotten. A grateful nation wishes you a well-deserved respite.</span>

I refer to a story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> by journalist Adele Ferguson, a courageous journalist who, in my opinion, always speaks the facts.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I instigated an inquiry into the liquidating industry and insolvency practitioners two years ago, and the report of that inquiry, from all sides of the parliament, was scathing about ASIC for not doing their job properly. They are the corporate watchdog. It is up to them to see that corporations play by the rules, do the right thing and see that financial products out there in the marketplace are not simply cars without brakes, in which people go down hills, crash into trees and destroy themselves. That is the problem I have with ASIC. I will continue:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">so that they are to be informed of the progress of their complaints, likely outcomes and reasons for decisions not to prosecute by police. In the case of ASIC, its policy is not to discuss progress of complaints, not to inform victims of decisions, and not to inform victims whether or not their complaints will be, or are being, acted upon. This policy allows them to hide many deficiencies and leaves victims in limbo.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a summary here from David Nicholson in a statutory declaration, sworn on a Bible, of course. David and his wife invested $100,000 with Ian Lazar, who was promoting risk-free investments secured by real property. Steven Brown of Etienne Lawyers arranged with his client Ian Lazar to take David's money as payment for fees owed in other matters. Mr Nicholson volunteered to go on the committee of inspection in the subsequent liquidation of Lazar's companies. The liquidator appointed by Lazar, firstly, and then later by ASIC was Andrew Wily of armstrongWily in Sydney. Wily enlisted Jim Byrnes to recover debts owed to the companies. Wily appointed Leon Nikolaidis as a solicitor. At the time Wily appointed him, Nikolaidis was awaiting trial for fraud and was subsequently convicted, jailed and struck off as a solicitor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Nicholson made several complaints about Wily's conduct to ASIC, with no response. No surprise. Wily appointed a litigation fund that appears not to exist and agreed to pay it $3.3 million for doing nothing, as it turned out. Wily consumed around $9 million in his own fees and moneys paid to others. Ordinary creditors and investors got nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. I also have a sworn statutory declaration from Kevin Jacobsen OAM, a well-known Australian through the entertainment industry, brother of Col Joye. Kevin Jacobsen was awarded the Order of Australia medal in 1985. He is 77 years old and has been one of the world's top theatrical producers for nearly 40 years. His name will be well known to many Australians. Mr Jacobsen operated the Sydney Entertainment Centre for 26 years and brought many famous entertainers to Australia. Mr Jacobsen had a successful business but needed some assistance with a company dispute over the lease at the entertainment centre. Ian Lazar, whose birth name was Ian Rogut, was introduced by Achilles 'Al' Constantinidis as a trusted business adviser and litigation funder. Al Constantinidis was a partner in the piggery of a former prime minister, Mr Paul Keating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the time that Kevin Jacobsen first met Lazar, which was less than one year ago, he has lost all his businesses and had all his trading companies placed in liquidation. He has had his car stolen by Ian Lazar. Mr Jacobsen told me how he told Mr Lazar that he would like to sell his Lexus. Lazar said, 'Give it to me. I am a licensed dealer. I will get rid of it.' He has not seen the car since or any money. He said, 'It has just disappeared like flatulence in the wind.' This is what we are facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Jacobsen had $84,000 fraudulently charged to his AMEX card by Mr Lazar. He has lost access to all the funds paid to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority to cover the breaking of the lease. Mr Jacobsen has lost a $6.1 million sale of rights over a musical because Mr Lazar has placed a false charge over Kevin Jacobsen Pty Ltd, the company involved which is now in liquidation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Constantinidis also introduced Andrew Wily of armstrongWily to Jacobsen. Within one hour of arriving to meet Jacobsen at the entertainment centre, Wily's staff had emptied all the cash out of the ATMs, and the cash appears not to have been seen again. Wily then charged $250,000 in fees for six days work. Mr Jacobsen has no knowledge of any work carried out by Wily. Staff of armstrongWily emptied the safe and all the ATMs at the entertainment centre and have never accounted for the cash. Jacobsen says, 'I believe it to be around $150,000 in cold cash.' Lazar then put in a claim for $1.2 million against the proceeds of the settlement when no moneys are owed to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. I will take you to the Webb family. Adam Webb and his family ran a successful company which had been operating for 25 years. They engaged a business adviser for restructuring by the name of John Brickwood who took over running of the company in September 2003. Brickwood's first act was to order staff to stop all payments to the ATO—group tax, company tax and superannuation guarantee levies. This information is all from sworn documents that I have here. These are not my words. Brickwood set about destroying the business and selling off the assets which the Webbs had built over their working lives. In December 2003 Brickwood told the Webbs he had a company that would provide 18 per cent interest on investment. Adam Webb's mother, father and sister invested $600,000 of their superannuation funds in this company. All funds were lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2005, the company manager provided Adam Webb with a statutory declaration about a conversation on a boat which was jointly owned by Brickwood and—guess who?—liquidator Andrew Wily. Brickwood discussed involving Wiley in liquidating a number of Webb's related companies and Wily agreed his fee would be around $300,000. Brickwood also disclosed he had a relationship with other staff of armstrongWily, such as Tim Gillespie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2004 Brickwood engaged Leon Nikolaidis to act for the Webbs. The same name appears again—the very solicitor who went to jail for fraud. Brickwood did not advise the Webbs that Nikolaidis was awaiting trial for a criminal matter for which he was subsequently convicted, jailed and struck off as a solicitor. Brickwood told Adam and Tony Webb in 2005 that Wily would be a friendly liquidator and would do what Brickwood wanted. After sale of a factory owned by Tony Webb where the purchaser paid $335,000 in GST, Brickwood placed that money in an unrelated company—Legal Response Pty Ltd—which he controlled. It was supposed to be paid to the tax office as BAS payments and GST. It has never been paid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When armstrongWily was administering or liquidating Vertex Trading Australia Pty Ltd, Adam Webb told Wily that Brickwood had stolen $1.5 million from Vertex Trading Pty Ltd and transferred it to his own company, Alternative Business Solutions Pty Ltd. David Hurst from armstrongWily said they could not take any action to get back the stolen money as they were not in charge of Vertex Trading Pty Ltd. Adam Webb prepared a chart of estimated losses through Brickwood's conduct to the ATO which shows around $3.5 million has been lost to the Australian Taxation Office. The Webbs lodged formal and written complaints to ASIC, the IPA and the Institute of Chartered Accountants about Wily. They received no assistance from any of these bodies, and that is no surprise to me. Time is against me to continue with other rotten deeds—about Mr Burt, who admitted to taking $600,000, losing it and saying he would pay it back. But now he just works for DoCS out at Wagga Wagga. I have a letter to table, where he agreed on taking the money, but ASIC says there will be no further investigations on him.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Mr Acting Deputy President, in the short time available I wanted to make some com­ments about the recent visit to this place by the Micah team. Micah, as you know, come here regularly to remind parliamentar­ians about the importance of poverty in our world and to keep us on track in looking at the issues of the Millennium Development Goals. The theme of this particular visit—they come with a theme each time—is 'WASHing Away Poverty'. Micah have prod­uced another marvellous document, which I really hope people will take and read, which looks at the important issues of water, sanitation and hygiene and how they affect communities. This is focused on millennium development goal No. 7. I know everyone in this place knows all of the Millennium Development Goals and to what they refer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene program, referred to as the WASH program, looks at how water and sanitation operate and how we need to fund these areas in developing countries. The scary statistics show that globally there are about 2.6 billion people living without access to basic sanitation and 884 million people living without access to safe drinking water. The consequences are extremely serious. The World Health Organisation estimates that providing access to WASH could prevent 28 per cent of child deaths or, in other words, save the lives of more than two million children every year. While children may be the most affected by inadequate WASH, the diagrams provided in this document show how the issues of water—something we take for granted in this country—can impact on all the other elements which are counted towards poverty in this world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a clear commitment to this process. One of the things that the United Nations General Assembly said when they were looking at the Millennium Develop­ment Goals was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Safe and clean drinking water and sanitation is a human right essential to the full enjoyment of life and all other human rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong words. I think in our country we have become almost inured to the idea that water and sanitation are available. But that is not the case overseas. That is one of the things that, through the Millennium Development Goals, we are examining and looking at progress—and there have been good news stories. Certainly we should celebrate those as well as looking at where we can do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really fortunate earlier this year to go to several countries in Africa through the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delegation. Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Russell Trood, who was with us in the last term, were on that trip as well. We were amazed at the amount of work that AusAID was doing on the issues of water and sanitation in a number of countries. We went to visit areas in Zimbabwe, in Harare, in areas that were looking at developing good plumbing and basic amenities in the region. Not only was AusAID working with local people in putting the plumbing together—and perhaps I have too close a view of being in that place—they were involved with local theatre groups, so there were education programs funded by AusAID which gave, in theatre, information to the community about how sanitation operates. I truly believe that theatre and engagement in that way is better than every speech that has ever been made. We could see how the kids in the area were learning about good sanitation and cleanliness programs by being engaged with people who were entertaining. That is part of the AusAID program. That is where the people who came to see us through Micah were saying, 'Yes, we have been doing well, but we need to do more,' and there is a claim that we should look at greater expenditure through AusAID, and that needs to be considered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Micah met with AusAID and also the minister's office to talk about a number of things, including how money can best be spent. One issue is the need to separate the issues of clean water and the issues of sanitation. Everybody knows about the need for clean water and there have been great successes. But as Bob McMullan put it—I remember Bob making this comment—while people are really keen to be around good news stories about clean water, perhaps they are not as keen to be photographed beside toilets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was proven wrong yesterday when a whole range of parliamentarians from both houses were very keen to be photographed in various positions around a very large toilet. I have to admit I was not brave enough to climb up on top, as we saw Mr Oakeshott and others do. But by putting the focus there, the issue of having effective sanitation is an important aspect for all of us, and through our aid program we can move to do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The message from Micah is that we cannot forget our responsibilities. When you see the joy that effective clean water services and sanitation can bring to kids at school and to communities, that is a message for all of us. I say to the Micah team: keep coming and putting us on track and showing us where we have done well; but, more importantly, keep showing us what we can do better.</span>

It shows that the economy contin­ues to grow. It shows that jobs continue to grow. It shows that incomes continue to grow and that domestic emissions will fall to nearly half of what they would be without carbon pricing in 2050. These are all findings that I am sure the opposition will continue to ignore.</span>

Speaking of false­hoods, I refer the minister to this updated modelling and the assumption and all the modelled scenarios within it that 'Australia introduces a domestic carbon price in a world where other countries also act to mitigate climate change'. Does the govern­ment believe that other countries, particu­larly the United States and China, have policies in place that will ensure they comply with this assumption? If not, how quickly will they have such policies in place?</span>

In the four scenarios modelled by the government, why has the government not modelled at least one scenario where other countries do not meet the government's optimistic outlook for international action? Given that President Obama recently shelved a tightening of smog standards which would have lowered emissions, isn't it the case that not only are other countries backtracking on pricing emissions but they also backtracking on reducing emissions? Isn't Labor's policy just leaving Australia like a shag on a rock?</span>

It confirms that the Australian economy is expected to grow faster than all major advanced economies next year despite increased global instability. The IMF has issued a stark warning about the outlook for the global economy, something we should all be mindful of, because global activity has weakened and downside risks are intensifying. Despite this, the IMF has given a ringing endorsement of the Australian economy—an economy that can look forward to faster growth than any other major advanced economy, an economy located in the part of the world which is growing, an economy with relatively low unemployment, an economy where we have seen 730,000 jobs created since Labor came to government, an economy with strong public finances, an economy with a $430 billion investment pipeline coming into our economy and a clear plan to return to surplus in 2012-13. This is a resounding endorsement of the economic management of this government.</span>

This is a government which has taken the approach of focusing on supporting our economy and jobs during a time of crisis and ensuring that in years to come all Australians benefit from the economy's strength. This stands in stark contrast to the negativity of those opposite, who have done nothing but seek to talk down the economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given the revelations today that even the new headquarters for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency will use cheaper but more emissions-intensive Chinese aluminium, what chance will Australian manufacturers have to compete against cheaper but more emissions-intensive imports once Labor's carbon tax has pushed up the cost of production in Australia even further and made more environmental friend­ly Australian products less competitive?</span>

The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has not commissioned a new building. The depart­ment has signed an agreement to relocate to a new building development in Canberra to meet the department's need for office space. As a tenant the department does not have input into the awarding of contracts for the base building, which would be a matter for the developer. The department is a tenant and not the developer of the building, and obviously the developer makes its decisions about the contracts that are awarded.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a range of assertions, but I would make this point: as Senator Carr has previously outlined to the chamber, this government has a very strong record of providing support for Australian industry. It was Labor that introduced requirements for Australian Industry Participation Plans to be developed by companies bidding for major government procurements. Since January 2010 an approved Australian Industry Participation Plan has been required from companies bidding for major Australian government contracts. These plans outline how Australian industry would be given opportunities to supply goods and services. We have seen in the last 18 months approxi­mately $2.5 billion worth of announced contracts that have required Australian Industry Participation Plans. The government has also tightened requirements for firms accessing the Enhanced Project By-Law Scheme. Under this program eligible public and private project proponents must submit and implement a similar plan—an Australian Industry Participation Plan—if they wish to access duty concessions for imported goods not available in Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  One thing I would say about Mr Howard is that he did not ever have an economic team that presented a $70 billion black hole, which is what you are presenting. So if Senator Brandis wants to defend John Howard, perhaps he should start to look at his own team. I also make the point that, as the Treasury's modelling shows, we can price carbon, grow our economy, increase jobs, increase our incomes and reduce emissions; unlike the opposition's policy, which will double the cost for Australian business to achieve the same outcome. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given emissions from aluminium production in China are 50 per cent higher than emissions from produ­cing aluminium in Australia, is it not true that a carbon tax which makes Australian manufacturers less competitive will actually cause an increase in global emissions when this is supposed to be about reducing global emissions? Why is the government so intent on forcing Australians to make significant sacrifices through higher costs of living and fewer jobs when its carbon tax will end up increasing global emissions instead of reducing them?</span>

There is a proposition in which the Liberal Party used to believe but no longer do, which is if you want to reduce emissions you should do so at the lowest cost. We are doing so at the lowest cost. We are pricing carbon and we are utilising a market mechanism. That is the sensible economic policy. We are also supporting jobs through the transition by a very substan­tial jobs and competitiveness program, to assist industries, including aluminium, which will be provided with assistance. I would make this point. Those opposite appear to be saying that we should not impose a cost. They will impose a great cost. They have the same environmental objective and the Australian Treasury has made clear—these are the people who want the modelling—that you will double the cost to Australian business. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am aware of the Humane Society International and four other conservation groups which are calling for immediate cessation of gillnets in the southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery in Commonwealth waters. Australia has some of the best managed fisheries in the world. The Gillard government is committed to ensuring the long-term protection of biodiversity in the marine environment. Interaction with which protected marine species in all fishery sectors are taken seriously by this government. The Australian Fisheries and Management Authority, AFMA, has initiated new arrangements to better protect and monitor Australian sea lions, dolphins, seabirds and nontargeted shark species.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning specifically to sea lions, AFMA implemented the Australian Sea Lion Management Strategy on 1 July 2010 to reduce the risk of and improve the level of information about sea lion interaction in the gillnet hook and trap fishery. Advice on the implementation of the strategy is provided by a working group which comprises marine mammal experts and environment and fishing industry representatives. The strategy was strengthened in May 2011 to provide enhanced protection for sea lions and other threatened endangered and protected species. The strategy now includes significant area closures around each of the 48 colonies in South Australia totalling 18,500 square kilometres, a requirement that all boats fishing within the sea lion area are always independently monitored through either a camera system or an on-board scientific observer, regular reviews to assess the effectiveness of the strategy and closure of large areas of the fishery if predetermined levels of female sea lion mortalities are reached. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Returning to the sea lions, given that the federal environment minister gave fisheries managers and the industry until 30 June 2010 to implement measures, including voluntary closure of fisheries, to enable the recovery of all Australian sea lion subpopulations, what measures to protect these animals, which are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, have been made to date? Are the measures in line with the best available scientific advice?</span>

As I said in my primary answer to the question, I have outlined the strengthening of the strategy from 1 May 2011. In addition this strategy recognises that breeding females are the most important part of the population in terms of population growth. AFMA is reviewing the acceptable mortality levels for each colony given their varying size and status. AFMA remains proactive in ensuring and maintaining this species. And to ensure appropriate protection of  sea lions, AFMA is also reviewing interaction thresholds in the fishery that would see access closed to gillnet fishers if predetermined levels were met. Since the start of the strategy in mid-2010 there have been three reported Australian sea lion mortalities. AFMA continues to work with marine mammal experts, other scientists, fisheries and, of course, environmental experts and industries to ensure that the Australian sea lions are properly protected. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer the minister yet again to the statement by the Prime Minister on 8 July 2010 when she said, 'I would rule out anywhere that is not a signatory to the refugee convention.' Given that Nauru, unlike Malaysia, is a country that has signed the UN Convention on Refugees and is ready, willing and able to reopen the Australian-built offshore processing centre immediately, why won't the government swallow its ill-fated pride and pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and restart offshore processing, as it consistently says it wants to, immediately?</span>

What he said was that 'it was never our issue as to whether there was a signatory to the refugee convention'. What we do also know is that the UNHCR has indicated that the agreement with Malaysia has the potential to enhance the protection for refugees in Malaysia as well as the region as a whole.

I refer the minister to the statement by former Western Australian Labor Premier Geoff Gallop last Friday when he said, 'I'd be talking to the Liberals about getting Nauru to work; I think that is the only sustainable position'. If a respected former Labor Premier, along with many members of the Labor caucus, admits that the coalition's Nauru option is the only sustainable position to recommence offshore processing, why doesn't the government accept its own colleagues' advice?</span>

We also know, especially now, given the circum­stances that have arisen and given the historical experience of Nauru, that it is not likely to succeed in the future. Nauru is a model which the government has rejected, and we believe firmly in the proposition that the government has advanced that Malaysia is a successful proposition. That is clearly why the opposition is so strenuous in its opposition to it. Nauru is about providing a ticket to Australia. It does not act as a disincentive for the people smugglers who are selling that ticket on the international market.</span>

What we have is a party that is firmly committed to putting people back into harm's way by sending boats back out to sea. How can you possibly claim that you have got an interest in human rights? Your policy on Nauru saw the gross abuse of people on that island and saw enormous pain being inflicted on people on that island—a country that had not signed up to the UN conventions and had no interest in the UN conventions until very recently. Your interest in human rights is very short lived and very recent.

The Liberal Party is going to reverse the mining tax and, as a conse­quence, it will have to increase the contri­butions tax on superannuation and it will have to increase taxes on small business. We heard dire predictions. I recall the debate. We were going to have mass unemployment. The economy would be floored when compulsory superannuation was introduced. And what happened? It made the economy strong. And who opposed it? The Liberal Party. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Well, Mr Hockey has confessed. That is what they have to find. They have to find $70 billion. Fortu­nately, due to this Labor government and their effective economic management, we have—and the IMF acknowledged this—one of the lowest levels of government debt amongst all advanced economies. But to add to the problems, to add to the risk to the Australian economy, the Liberal-National Party have pledged to reverse the carbon tax. But as a consequence they are going to have to reduce age pensions. They are going to have to increase income taxes. If they ever get the chance and they want to give that $11 million in mining tax back to the mining companies, which actually want to pay, they are going to have to increase the contribu­tions tax on superannuation of $3½ million. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer the minister to the detailed unemployment data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last Thursday which showed that the unemployment rate in regional Australia is six per cent while the unemployment rate in capital cities is 5.1 per cent. Given that the economic modelling confirms that a carbon tax will hit regional Australia the hardest, can the minister provide the name of one person with a green job in regional Australia?</span>

I would hope he would acknow­ledge that it is in great part due to the actions taken by this government, opposed by those opposite, to stave off a recession—action which was opposed by those opposite and which ensured that some 200,000 Austra­lians who would have been on the dole queues are not but are in work. This government have created 730,000 jobs since we came to government, the effect of which can be seen by looking at where the American unemployment rate is and where ours is. We entered the global financial crisis with around the same rate of unemployment; we have exited this period with an unem­ployment rate with a five in front of it, as opposed to a nine.

First, in relation to regional jobs I again make the point as to where a number of renewable energy projects are situated. Those would include the Macarthur Wind Farm, which will create 900 jobs during construction, the Woodlawn Wind Farm in New South Wales, 150 jobs during construction, and the solar farm in New South Wales that will create another 50 jobs. I would also make the point that the Carbon Farming Initiative, which, as I recall, was opposed by those opposite, does include a substantial investment in regional Australia, including $33.6 million to establish regional Landcare facilitated positions in each of the NRM regions which, I am advised by my colleague, is in the process of being implemented. I would make this point: Senator Joyce fails to understand the importance of moving this economy to clean energy— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Can the minister explain how the government can determine the impact of the carbon tax on regional Australia, when it has released no modelling of the impact of the carbon tax on regional Australia? When will the government come clean with regional Australia and release the detailed modelling of the impact of the carbon tax on towns such as Rockhampton, held by Kirsten Livermore, Mackay, Gladstone and the Hunter Valley?</span>

We consolidated the programs of expenditure in regional Austra­lia into a single document—a budget book.

Last week the Federal Court ruled that the Business Service Wage Assessment Tool, which is used by Australian Disability Enterprises that are funded by the federal government to set the wages of intellectually disabled workers, does not breach anti-discrimination laws. This is despite the fact that the BSWAT tests disabled workers only of their knowledge of workplace health and safety practices, not how well they do their jobs. Further, other employers of disabled workers use a different test, which also considers disabled workers' productivity and therefore results in higher wage rates. Does the government think it reasonable and truly non-discrimin­atory that, under the BSWAT, workers who are intellectually disabled are paid as little as $1 an hour?</span>

This is a government that has stood for jobs. We support jobs at all levels and believe in the dignity and great purpose of work.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Disability Enterprises give people with moderate to severe disability the chance to participate in work, to meet new friends and to become more financially independent. Australian Disability Enter­prises are competitive businesses, partly funded by the Australian government and employing around 20,000 people. People with a disability who are working in Australian Disability Enterprises need high levels of support to do their jobs. Most of these workers would also be receiving some sort of social security payment, largely through the disability support pension.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you a bit of history on the issue. When supported employment through Australian Disability Enterprises was brought into the industrial relations system in 2003 the Business Services Wage Assess­ment Tool was developed for use in Australian Disability Enterprises. Earlier this month, as Senator Xenophon mentioned, the Federal Court found that the tool was not discriminatory under the Disability Discrimination Act in its application to two employees in Australian Disability Enter­prises. The Federal Court found that the determination of wage levels for employees in ADEs by a method involving assessment of competencies is appropriate. The Federal Court dismissed the case brought by these employees against the Australian Disability Enterprises they worked for and against the Commonwealth.</span>

In relation to the supported wage system used in open emplo­yment, the Federal Court found significant contrast between Australian Disability Enterprises, some of which use the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool, and open employment. With open employment, employers are able to choose the people they employ. Australian Disability Enterprises have limited scope to choose which employ­ees to accept. The Federal Court also found that Australian Disability Enterprises are required to provide an increased level of supervision, with a consequent increase in costs. The court concluded that it was reasonable for Australian Disability Enter­prises to use an assessment tool like the Business Services Assessment Tool.</span>

I do not have the detail Senator Xenophon has asked for at hand. I would say, though, that the govern­ment is committed to improving supported employment for people with disability through Australian Disability Enterprises. We are working with disability advocates and with Australian Disability Enterprises to develop a 10-year vision for supported employment. This will work towards improving access for people with disability who need supported employment, improving the experiences of people with disability in supported employment and strengthening Australian Disability Enterprises as progres­sive and sustainable commercial enterprises that provide inclusive supported employ­ment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning in the House of Representa­tives the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship introduced amendments to the Migration Act to try to repair the collapse of the government's border protection policy as a result of the decision of the High Court three weeks ago. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, announced that the opposition would support that bill, which is quite a detailed bill, provided that the government acceded to one short amendment that the opposition will move. The purpose of that amendment is to instate Nauru as an offshore processing country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite unbelievably, the government, rather than reach out to the opposition—whose cooperation the government has sought and whose cooperation has been freely offered—the Prime Minister refuses to accept that amendment. What does that tell you about the government? This is a government that refuses to consider the only option—offshore processing in Nauru—that has ever solved the problem of unlawful asylum seekers coming to Australia. The only option they refuse to consider is the only option that has ever worked. How can anybody take seriously the good faith of the government on this matter, faced with a catastrophic collapse of their policy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a reason, and it is a very ignoble reason, why the only option they refuse to consider is the only option that has ever worked. It is because, if they were to do so, they would be conceding that the opposition had it right all along. And the one thing this Prime Minister's pride will not ever let her do is to concede that the government got it wrong and the opposition got it right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy President, let me just remind you that, when the Pacific solution, based on offshore processing in Nauru, was introdu­ced in 2001, the number of unlawful arrivals dwindled to a negligible number. In the following six years, there were 18 boats, an average of three per year throughout the period that the Nauru processing centre was in operation. Why was that? Because it did break the people smugglers' business model, because only 43 per cent of the people who were processed in Nauru ended up in Australia. A majority of those people who sought to put themselves and their families into the hands of the people smugglers so that they could get to Australia failed to do so. There were 1,637 people in all processed on Nauru, of whom only 705 were resettled in Australia having been assessed as genuine refugees—43 per cent.</span>

                  </a>  If you doubt that figure, Senator Pratt, it comes from a press release by Mr Bowen, your colleague, on 2 February 2010. Given that there is a proven solution to this problem, why then, when the opposition is moving an amendment to enable the government to reinstate that proven solution to the problem, would a government be so blind, so pig-headed, so stubborn, so arrogant, so consumed with overweening pride, as to say to a cooperative opposition: 'No. The one thing we won't do is take your successful idea on board as our policy, because it was your idea and to adopt it would mean admitting our failure'?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here is an act of sabotage from those opposite. They may well argue that Nauru is their solution. They are entitled to do so. But they do not seek to simply do that. After having strutted the political stage last week dressed in the clothing of biparti­sanship, having offered the Prime Minister all of the assistance that they could muster so that we can come to a joint solution, a bipartisan solution, around this terribly vexed question, what have we seen when the rubber hits the road? The simple answer to that is: sabotage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest fear in the breasts of those opposite is not that the Malaysian solution will fail but that it will succeed. Their greatest fear is that the boats will stop coming when the people-smuggling model is broken by the Malaysian solution. So what have those opposite constructed? They have constructed this fig leaf which is that they will only assist the government in amending the legislation insofar as it realises the policies of the coalition. We do not have this hubris in the debate. We are suggesting to the parliament that the legislation be amended so that offshore processing can be enabled. We do not seek to stipulate where that offshore processing happens.</span>

                  </a>  The simple truth of it is, Senator Brandis, that, if in the future you and your colleagues form a government, you will come to this parliament with a piece of legislation very similar, if not identical, to that being put into the House of Representa­tives by the Labor Party. At that moment, your cynical sabotage in these days will come to the fore.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is simply an outrage that those opposite will only amend the legislation insofar as it forces the government's hand in Nauru. Our proposition is a far more sensible one. Over 80 per cent of people start their journey to Australia in Malaysia. That is a matter of fact. We simply propose a Malaysian solution, the detail of which is out. Your clinging to the Nauru solution is a matter for you. You can take that to the people as you please, but what you should not be allowed to do is to escape this debate on the basis that, if the Labor Party government does not do what you want it to do, then it can do nothing. On the basis of that proposition, you will not only lose the public debate; you will also lose your pretence to the moral high ground. There is no moral high ground for you in this debate. You can either make good the pledge of the Leader of the Opposition and assist the government in coming up with a piece of legislation that enables offshore processing or, alternatively, you can cling to sabotage in the face of all logic. If you cling to sabotage in the face of all logic, then you will follow the road just set out by Senator Brandis. If you say that the government can only do offshore processing if it does it where you want, how you want, when you want, if that is the arrogant proposition you insist on putting to this parliament, then it will be you that has slain offshore process­ing. It will be at your feet that offshore processing fails.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have negotiated with the countries in this region and we have done so in the context of preparing a proper framework. The Bali process has been a part of that. Part of the Malaysian solution is an enhanced commitment to the humanitarian and refugee intake. We are proud of the fact—and those opposite pretend that they are too—that this country takes some 13,500 refugees. Under the proposal put forward by this government, that would increase by a further 1,000 a year. That, we think, is a fine thing. The Malaysian solution not only enhances this government's and this country's response to refugees and increases the refugee intake but also means that we are working with our regional partners on a regional solution that tackles the people-smuggling model. We are taking away the product that those in Jakarta— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I do not know where to start with that claptrap. I really do not. We are told that the opposition is engaged in an act of sabotage. I remind the parliamentary secretary that the government has sabotaged a succession of its own options for offshore processing before today. They wanted to go to East Timor because they wanted offshore processing. They did not talk to the East Timorese and it failed. They wanted to go to Manus Island. They have not thought that through. They wanted to go to Malaysia and they have only barely scraped that deal together. Even now, it is not clear whether that will work.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Brandis:</span>
                  </a>  And it's illegal.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HUMPHRIES:</span>
                  </a>  And it is illegal, according to the High Court. They claim they have regional partners. Name one. Name a regional partner. Some flimsy deal with Malaysia where they give us 4,000 of their asylum seekers and we give them 800 is not a regional arrangement. That is a bilateral deal between Australia and Malaysia which involves no other country. It is not regional at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has cycled through a whole succession of failed policies and now finds itself in the position where its latest option is its only option. The only thing it will accept by way of offshore processing is the one option it needs the parliament to support and, not surprisingly, the parliament, as far as I can see, unanimously but for the Labor Party is saying, 'No, Malaysia is not an acceptable option. Malaysia is the worst possible option of all the options available to the government right now.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not demand that they implement Nauru as the only place on which to have offshore processing. We think Nauru is the best place because we know Nauru works. Nauru worked for six years under the previous government, in combination with temporary protection visas and turning back the boats when safe to do so. But our amendment, the Nauru amendment before the House of Representatives at the moment, does not demand that only Nauru be accepted. It only demands that countries which are signatories to the convention on refugees be considered for offshore process­ing. There are 148 of those options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government knows that it is in a bind. The government knows that its preference of recent days for offshore processing now boils down to being prepared to be flexible, and it needs to make a decision. The opposition is not saying, 'No, they cannot have offshore processing.' The opposition is saying that they do have a way out of this dilemma. They can climb aboard the boat to freedom we are offering them, which is a proven method of turning back the people smugglers and deterring the business of people smugglers—and that is to accept that a country such as Nauru provides a valid and viable way of solving their present problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Brandis has pointed out, the only thing that stands between this government sinking into a morass of failure with respect to this matter and returning to a policy of onshore processing, which we know will lead to an explosion again in the number of boats arriving on our shores, and the only thing that stops them from grasping the solution in front of them is pride. It is pride that prevents them from acknowledg­ing that maybe, just maybe, John Howard had it right with the Nauru Pacific solution. Maybe he got it right. They have spent so much time and so much political capital knocking down the solution over a period of six or seven years that they now cannot bring themselves to say, 'Maybe he was actually right.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that it is not our job in the opposition to sort out the mess that this government has got itself into with one failed policy after another in this area. But we are offering a way out—a simple way out with a very small amendment to the government legislation, introduced into the other place today. It is the Nauru amendment. All it takes is for them to do the right thing and accept that it is a way out. I particularly appeal to people like Senator Cameron—who has argued within his own party that the Malaysian solution does, indeed, breach Australia's international obligations—to do the right thing and cross the floor to support this legislation with our amendment when the opportunity arises. I have crossed the floor before. It can be done. Senator Cameron has the same privilege and right as a member of parliament. If he believes what he said about not going down this iniquitous path of the Malaysian solution, he can do the same thing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have seen a complete ignorance of the facts and of the advice of experts on a very difficult and emotive area of public policy. Unfortunately, it is becoming a bit of a habit of those opposite to ignore the facts, to ignore the advice of experts and to spread untruths in the Australian community on important public policy issues. We have seen that again today when they tried to rubbish the Treasury modelling on a carbon price. They have said that Labor's plan will not work and they have spread untruths about that. They have ignored the advice of all expert economists and expert scientists when it comes to that public policy issue, and here we see it again on a very important, very emotive and very difficult public policy issue—one on which in many countries there is bipartisan support and leadership from both opposition and government when it comes to dealing with it.

What does Tony Abbott do, upon the advice of Andrew Metcalfe? He comp­letely ignores his advice. He completely ignores the advice in the wake of the High Court decision.

They ignore the fact that there are no facilities currently available and ready on Nauru to process asylum seekers. In fact, much of the processing centre has been given away to the Nauru people. It has been gifted to the Nauru people. It is providing pergolas over barbeques for the people of Nauru. These are facts that are being ignored by those opposite. They also ignore the fact that many asylum seekers were left to rot on Nauru. For 1,637 asylum seekers that were accommodated in Nauru and on Manus Island the average stay was 501 days—approximately 1⅓ years. One man was left to rot on Nauru for 1,938 days—over five years. More than 120 people, including 19 children, I might add, were left to rot for over three years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  I am used to the minister, when responding to questions, stretching the truth; but I have to say, in the short time that Senator Thistlethwaite has been here, I am very disappointed that he seems to have decided to indulge in the same type of misleading of the Senate that the minister does. The statistics that Senator Thistleth­waite quotes in relation to Nauru are just plain wrong. They are not the statistics that Mr Metcalfe, the secretary of the department, gave to Senator Brandis and others when the coalition was briefed by Mr Metcalfe in relation to the government's Malaysia solu­tion. They are also not the statistics that are quoted by the Labor Minister for Immi­gration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, in a press release dated Tuesday, 2 February 2010. These are the statistics, the correct statistics, as put forward by Mr Bowen, the immigration minister. Under John Howard's Pacific solution 1,637 people were taken to Nauru. How many were resettled in Australia? This is the minister for immigration's statistic: 705. Seven hundred and five people out of 1,637—that is, 43 per cent—according to the minister for immigra­tion's own press release, were resettled in Australia. It is not the 95 per cent that the Labor Party likes to throw around so that they can distort the situation as it was in Nauru. For those on the other side to stand up and say that Nauru did not work, which part of the former Howard government's policies that stopped the boats don't you understand?</span>

It is the Prime Minister of Australia who consistently tells the people that she wants offshore processing. Well, if the Prime Minister of Australia listens to the coalition, she will know that this can be delivered by us in agreement with the Labor Party tomorrow. Bring it on tomorrow and we will vote for it. All that we ask is this: we ask the Prime Minister to keep her word to the Australian people when she said again to the Australian people, 'I would rule out any­where that is not a signatory to the refugee convention.' So to ensure that we have responsible government in Australia the coalition are putting forward an amendment that will ensure that the current Prime Minister of Australia is actually able to honour her word to the Australian people that she will rule out anywhere that is not a signatory to the refugee convention. That is exactly what our amendment ensures. It ensures that, when Australia transfers an asylum seeker to a third party, that third party has to be a signatory to the United Nations refugee convention.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) to a question without notice asked by Senator Wright today relating to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and the protection of marine species.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important and urgent issue. Last week five conservation groups, the Australian Marine Conservation Society, the Wilderness Society, the Conservation Council of South Australia, the Humane Society International and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society called for an immediate ban on the use of gillnets in a shark fishery, operating in Commonwealth waters off South Australia, due to the deaths of many sea lions and dolphins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time in our history we are facing the worst extinction rate in 65 million years, since dinosaurs were wiped out. We must take this issue seriously. In this particular fishery in Commonwealth waters it is estimated that 256 threatened Australian sea lions are killed each year. I also understand that the latest available information shows that 13 dolphins were also killed in this fishery in the first three months of this year alone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has put in place a strategy to attempt to protect the Australian sea lion, but this has been criticised as being grossly inadequate and now it would appear that impacts on dolphins are also increasing. Unfortunately, the exact numbers and the nature of the dolphin deaths are not known. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA, seems unwilling to publicise the latest figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The public have a right to know how many sea lions and dolphins are being killed and what measures are being taken to remedy this. Gillnets are an acknowledged threat to the survival of sea lions at places such as Seal Bay on Kangaroo Island, which is a major tourist drawcard for the island. It seems that gillnets are also now killing dolphins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Urgent action is needed to prevent the suffering and death of these animals. They are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. A ban on the use of gillnets in Comm­onwealth waters off the coast of South Australia, as called for by the five conser­vation groups mentioned, and better infor­mation from AFMA would assist in the practical protection of these iconic and majestic creatures.</span>

I know leave usually has to be given before the amendment. That is the usual thing. However, I have from this position often asked what the nature of the amendment is because it then informs me as to whether I will decide to grant leave or not. In that instance you can, in my view seek leave, and I would give it,  to explain the amendment before we then end up in a position of suspending standing orders to deal with it. This is a way to expedite the arrangement and allow the opposition, or the government for that matter, to hear what the amendment may be and consider it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to be able to move the amend­ment to this motion because we know that the motion put forward by Senator Abetz is pure hypocrisy. We know that the govern­ment has a bad plan when it comes to dumping vulnerable people in Malaysia. We know it contravenes the 1951 Refugee Con­vention. We also know that the opposition's plan of dumping vulnerable people in Nauru would contravene the 1951 convention.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time that both the government and the opposition recognise that the Australian people are fed up with the hypocrisy and with the dirty arguments that not just put the lives of vulnerable people in harm's way but trash Australia's international obligations. We know it is time we had a proper process for dealing with these issues. Why do we drag out the lives of some of the world's most vulnerable people just because there is a political standoff, a squabble, between the government and the opposition? Neither side is standing up for our obligations. Neither side is doing what they should be doing, which is to ensure that our domestic laws concur with our international obligations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely paramount that we do what it is we have signed up to do: assess the claims of asylum seekers here on the Austra­lian mainland. It is what the majority of Australians want; it is the cheapest option; it is the most humane one; and, above all else, it is legal. We should just get on with it. There is absolute rank hypocrisy in this motion, as put forward by Senator Abetz. It does not do anything to add any substance or standard to the level of debate we are seeing not just in this place but in the other place as well. How about the Leader of the Oppo­sition and the Leader of the House actually stand up for what Australia signed up for 60 years: protecting the rights of vulnerable people when they arrive on our doorstep, doing what it is that we should be doing. Stop trashing Australia's international obliga­tions just because of the politics of the day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that onshore processing would be a much simpler option. It would be cheaper, it would be more humane and it is popular. We know that the government does not support Nauru. We know that the opposition does not support Malaysia. We know that offshore processing is bad policy: it is morally wrong; it is illegal; and it is expensive. So just give it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one thing that is actually right in this debate. It is that both sides are right about the rank hypocrisy of the other. Both sides have sold out. Both sides are partici­pating in a debate based on hypocrisy and backflips. There is absolutely no substance to the issues that go to the heart of the needs of asylum seekers. We should be doing what it is we said we would do under the convention we signed 60 years ago. The question and the amendment that I am putting to the Senate is: will we stand by the convention we signed 60 years ago? Under the government's plan we will not. Under the opposition's plan we will not. Is it that both sides are prepared to shred our international reputation, shred Australia's value of a fair go and throw away 60 years of commitment to the refugee convention? That is exactly what both sides want. That is the effect of both proposals—Malaysia and Nauru.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a sad point we have got to in this debate when we are being forced to choose between dumping children in Malaysia and dumping children in Nauru. There is a much better solution; it is an Australian option. It means assessing the claims of asylum seekers onshore here on the mainland, as most Australians would like us to do. It is cheaper, more humane and it is legal. That is what this amendment is about: asking both the coalition and the government to do exactly what we have already signed up to do, which is to abide by our obligations under the 1951 refugee convention. If you are not interested in that, why not just say so? Stop playing with the lives of vulnerable people. Stop pretending that you care when clearly you do not. All you care about is the political points you are trying to make on the way through. And thank heavens the Australian people are wise enough to see through the hypocrisy and the sell-outs and ensure a better solution. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  It seems that the Australian Greens are as confused about the standing orders of this place as they are in relation to their immi­gration and asylum-seeker policy stance. We heard from the Greens that we are dealing with allegedly the most vulnerable people, those who are paying literally thousands and thousands of dollars to people-smugglers to come to Australia. They freely enter Indone­sia, they travel there freely with no problems at all and then pay a criminal people-smuggler to get them to Australia, having thousands of dollars at their disposal. Some­how, they are the most vulnerable people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forget those who have been rotting in refugee camps around the world, not for weeks or months but for over a decade. There are literally millions of them all around the world. We in Australia need to ask ourselves this one question: do we want to be engaged in the humane resettlement of refugees? Overwhelmingly, the answer is yes, as it should be. The next question is: to whom out of the millions of refugees in the world should we be giving priority? We in the coalition make no bones about the fact that we do not believe priority should be given to the rich, who can afford to pay criminals to force their way into Australia and who turn a blind eye to our obligation to those who are sitting in camps in Somalia, in Kenya and in other places in Africa, where they have been for well over a decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For somebody like me, who works with my local refugee communities in Hobart, to be told I am a hypocrite on this is quite offensive. When you hear their tales of having been in refugee camps for up to 15 years you get an understanding of why these particular refugees are so offended when priority is being given to the criminal boat-people smuggling operations. That is why the coalition put in place a policy that worked to stop this criminal activity, which also puts lives at risk. We stopped it with the Nauru solution. The Labor Party deliberately dismantled that policy, and guess what: the influx of boats occurred and the influx of illegal arrivals re-entered the Australian scene. This disrupted the orderly resettle­ment of refugees into Australia that we had, in cooperation with the United Nations. We had a policy which worked. Labor dismant­led it. Now, seeing the folly of their ways, Labor are trying to make themselves more hairy-chested than we as a coalition were in this space. We say to them that their Malaysia solution, where people can be caned for disobeying orders in Malaysia, is inhumane. The Labor Party  themselves set the benchmark for offshore processing that the country should be a signatory to the UN convention. Well, Nauru is; Malaysia is not. All we have done is suggest to the govern­ment that they should adopt the Nauru solution, the Manus Island solution, and dump the Malaysia solution, where we were going to be giving them one of our illegal entrants for five of theirs, a swap which, in anybody's language, was not good. In relation to today's motion, it is simply calling on the Senate to reject:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... the Government's attempts to provide inadequate protections for asylum seekers in its proposed legislation to resurrect its Malaysian asylum seeker deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought the Australian Greens would support such a motion, but of course it is splitting them away from their Labor alliance partners and they now, undoubtedly in a deal with Labor, are trying to scuttle around to come up with an excuse as to why not to support this motion. As a result, the hapless Senator Hanson-Young has been called in to move an amendment which seeks to negate this. We say the Malaysia solution is not a solution, because it is inhumane and in breach of our international obligations, whereas the Nauru solution is workable, proven and humane. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDWIG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  We are now debating the issue, as it seems people have wanted to do. I remind people that there was a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure which gave the Senate this advice:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee has considered the operation of standing order 66 on numerous occasions—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">so it is certainly not the first time this has occurred—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Standing order 66(3) provides that a formal motion shall be put and determined without amendment or debate. Current difficulties—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">including this one—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">are largely attributable to senators seeking leave to depart from these rules and the Senate granting leave, almost as a matter of course. In particular, the number of statements being made by leave in relation to complex motions leads to a de facto debate on those motions, contrary to standing order 66.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are not only doing what we are doing now, but we are also being chastised by the Procedure Committee into entering into de facto debates, of which I think this is one:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small"> This is because senators, instead of making statements, assert views in the nature of debate by mounting arguments and responding to positions expressed by others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While the committee recommends no changes to standing order 66, noting its value as a daily opportunity for motions from all sources and of all types to be put to the vote, it urges senators to pay more heed to the existing restrictions. For example, if a senator wishes to amend—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">as we tried to do today—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">a notice of motion, then generally, as a courtesy to the Senate, that notice should be postponed till the next day of sitting to enable the senator to use the procedures under standing order 77 to amend the notice in writing and for the notice to appear in its amended form in the next day's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is so that the Senate and everyone in the chamber and everyone who is not in the chamber can be given an opportunity to look at what that amendment is and participating, and at least being informed about what is happening in the chamber:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, the committee encourages parties to use internal means to limit the number of senators seeking leave to make statements on motions to one from each group,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, because of the way things have unfolded, we have entered into a motion to suspend. We should actually be arguing why the suspension is needed, not the substantive debate on the motion itself. Anyone listening to the debate would think we were debating the substantive motion. We should be arguing as to why this suspension should proceed. I note you can include parts of your argument within that because there is wide scope and latitude. So I am not particularly taking anyone to task in relation to that. I am sure I will also fall under the rule sometimes in these debates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">   What I want to highlight specifically is that we should not now, if we are unsucc­essful in an amendment or unsuccessful in seeking leave to take a statement, go through the process of then moving to a suspension to have the de facto argument. Otherwise we will take up significant time of the chamber. The government does have its business to get on with. It does want to continue with the program. We have taken note of remaining issues to be dealt with, other parts of the program. It is important to get to legislation, so I remind senators that this is an opportu­nity to put motions without debate, rather than going through this convoluted proce­dure of seeking a suspension so that we can be heard in relation to a debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not take anyone to task. I just wish to remind all senators that this is the purpose of this time—to put matters without debate so that their particular issues can be made known, rather than soaking up the time of the Senate with the complex motions we are now engaged in.  The government will not be supporting the motion to suspend on the basis that the government wants to get on with the business of the Senate and not be bogged down in dealing with these motions. For those reasons, as I have said, we will not be supporting the motion.</span>

Senators may notice that has not stopped the effect of the amendments coming before the chamber as they doing that as whole motions seriatim and that will continue. I think, however, that where amendments are to be moved to the motions there ought to be a better mechanism and the amendments ought to be treated with a vote the same as the substantial motions. We have not got to that point yet and here we are debating whether there should be a suspen­sion of standing orders to effectively debate the motion—and I will listen to debate to work that out. But what I do want to say is that Senator Hanson-Young is absolutely right here: what we have is a move by the coalition, which had no compunction a few years ago to be locking up hundreds of children behind razor wire in deserts in Australia to the point where there was psychological scarring for life, now claiming that sending people to this country—</span>

                  </a>  Senator Abetz, for the record, is denying that happened. Well, I do not know how you deny such an obvious piece of history, but sending people off to Nauru or to Manus Island for that effect and to Malaysia is not only a huge trial upon the wellbeing of people who try to come to this country to escape persecution elsewhere but the wrong thing to do. We are a nation that is mature and that is part of the common global community of nations and we ought to be taking on our responsi­bilities—and the High Court pointed this out when it turned down the government's legislation effectively to bounce people back off  to Malaysia. But it was not just the Malaysian solution that the High Court was ruling out; it was the Nauru solution and the Manus Island solution as well, for example, on the basis that these abrogate Australia's obligation under the refugee convention—which Sarah Hanson-Young has so rightly brought into this debate because it is front and centre—to give people fleeing perse­cution and coming to our shores access to Australian laws. Whichever one of these offshore options you are looking at it cuts across that requirement of the refugee convention. I notice Senator Abetz, in his delivery, said words to the effect that we swap one illegal entrant for each five of theirs. Let me pull him up on that again—and we must have done that so many times in this chamber. These are not illegal entrants; these people are asylum seekers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  As has been indicated by Senator Abetz, we will not be supporting the suspension for the simple reason that Senator Hanson-Young's foreshadowed amendment completely changes the intent of Senator Abetz's motion. I agree with Senator Ludwig and Senator Abetz that it would indeed be helpful if the Australian Greens did circulate their amendments in advance. This chamber does operate largely on cooperation and there is usually good cooperation on motions and the intent to seek to amend them, so I think that is something that would be of benefit to the chamber. The motion moved by Senator Abetz does, I think, deserve to be given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote—which the move to suspend and to seek to amend Senator Abetz's motion certainly denies. I also think that, because the government's absolute hypocrisy does deserve to be judged by this chamber, it does warrant the consideration of Senator Abetz's motion unamended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do hate to give the Australian Greens some credit at this point but it would not be fair not to recognise that when it comes to asylum seeker policy at least the Australian Greens do have a consistent position. They are against offshore processing, and they have been consistent on that. The Greens are wrong. I think they are sincerely in error but at least on this issue they, unlike the government, do have a clear position. The Australian Labor Party have lost any shred of credibility that they had on the subject of border protection and asylum seeker policy. When those of us on this side were in office, the Australian Labor Party announced that if they were elected they would systematically set about dismantling the coalition's border protection and asylum seeker policy. And they were true to their word, as the Australian Labor Party did that. They abolished offshore processing and they abolished temporary protection visas—they weakened their resolve—which again is something that they undertook to do. We were told that pull factors were not a consideration for people-smugglers, that it was all about push factors and that it was all about factors outside the control of the Australian government. We know now, beyond any doubt, that there are both pull and push factors. What frustrates me incred­ibly is when I hear the current government say that they want to break the people-smugglers' business model. The truth is that the product that the people smugglers have to sell was given to them by the Australian Labor Party. We hear the government say that they want to bust the business model, but that business model was the one designed by the current government. Our policies were aimed at—and I think they were effective—putting the people smugglers out of business and ensuring that people who were seeking asylum did not put themselves in harm's way. That was a good thing. That meant that we did not have people at risk on the high seas with their lives in peril.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber we are not interested in public acts of conspicuous compassion. We care about effective compassion—having policies that do good and take people out of harm's way. Our policies were effective. We heard initially from the current government of the East Timor solution—nothing came of that. We heard of the Malaysian solution—to date, nothing has come of that. The government is running away from any policy that will actually work. We had the farcical situation at the South Pacific Forum where Prime Minister Gillard was basically jumping behind pot plants to hide from the President of Nauru. We thought <span style="font-style:italic;">At Home with Julia</span> was a farce; you ain't seen nothing until you have seen 'Away with Julia'. It is a bit like that <span style="font-style:italic;">Fawlty Towers</span> episode about the war—'I think I mentioned it once but I think I got away with it.' 'I think I mentioned Nauru only once but I think I got away with it.' It was a farcical situation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government deserves to be condemn­ed for its asylum seeker policy. It has no policy. The policy, such as it is, has put people in harm's way. It should adopt our Nauru solution with TPVs and a strengthen­ed resolve. Senator Abetz's motion deserves to be put unamended.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I too rise to concur with the comments of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Eric Abetz, and my colleague Senator Fifield. We are currently debating a motion by Senator Hanson-Young to suspend standing orders to allow an amendment to general business notice of motion No. 444 to be moved. I have searched high and low and I have asked my colleagues if they have a copy of the amendment for me—I understand that Senator Hanson Young was asked to reread the amendment out to the Senate—but, to date, I do not know about you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I have been unable to find a copy of the amendment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Greens come into this chamber and stand here and talk about process and the failure of some to follow process, maybe they would like to have a look at their own conduct in relation to this particular motion. There is a very good reason that those on this side of the chamber will not be supporting Senator Hanson-Young's suspension motion, and that is that Senator Hanson-Young has failed to give this chamber the courtesy that is due to it. I acknowledge the comments made by Senator Ludwig on debating these types of motions, but when the Greens come into this chamber and stand up and completely misrepresent the position of the coalition in putting forward the motion it is incumbent upon those on this side—as those on the other side would do if they were in the same position as us—to come in here and defend their position. There is a very good reason that Senator Abetz has put forward this motion. If the Greens choose not to support this motion, then quite frankly that is their problem and they can go and justify to their supporters why they are supporting a motion that condemns government policy for its inadequate protections for people that we—Australia—will be transferring to Malaysia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you what the coalition will not support, and these are the reasons we have put forward this motion. We on this side of the chamber will not support legislation that will allow the Australian government to send asylum seekers to a country that has not signed the UNHCR convention. We on this side will not support legislation that allows the Australian government to send asylum seekers to a country where, in the last five years, almost 30,000 refugees were caned—that is 16 floggings a day—and that is man­dated by an act of parliament in Malaysia. We on this side will not support legislation that allows the Australian government—and that is a government that is only in govern­ment because of its coalition with the Greens—to take children to Malaysia where they will not be able to have proper school­ing. We on this side will not support legisla­tion that allows the Australian government, again, to transfer refugees to Malaysia where they will have access to only one UNHCR funded medical clinic, which they will have to share with 94,000 other refugees. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition—and this is the reason for Senator Abetz's motion—in good conscience cannot support such morally objectionable legislation. The reason the Greens want to move the amendment is that they too know that the government is wrong. They know the government is wrong in what it is doing and, if the government is wrong, the Greens should be sitting on this side of the chamber with the coalition condemning their coalition partners. The coalition will make no apology whatsoever for their own tough and uncompromising policies on border protection, because what we did—unlike what the Greens want to do—was stop the boats. Do you know what happens when you stop the boats? You stop people risking their lives to get to this country and dying in the process. If the Greens had their way, they would have onshore processing. Do you know what that means? That means they do not want to stop the boats and they support policies that will cause people to be drowned.</span>

                  </a>  In respect of the previous motion, No. 447, the government does not support conducting our complex defence and foreign policy by way of simple Senate resolutions. Australia remains a strong promoter of peace and security, regionally and globally, and has a long and very proud history of supporting United Nations and regional peacekeeping opera­tions. While the government respects the sentiment behind the motion, the notion of a global ceasefire for the duration of the International Day of Peace is impractical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, many conflicts we face, particu­larly terrorism and piracy, are not state based and do not respect international peace. A call to cease fire against these threats would be counterproductive to Australia and our partners' continued efforts for peace and security. The government's strong view is that it is in our national interest to be in Afghanistan, not just with our alliance partner the United States but also with 47 other members of the International Security Assistance Force, acting under a United Nations mandate. Australia's fundamental goal is to prevent Afghanistan, especially the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, from again being used by terrorists to plan and train for attacks on innocent civilians, including Australians, in our own region and beyond. To achieve that goal we must help prepare the Afghan government to take lead responsibility for providing security for the Afghan people. To do so we must stabilise the security situation and mentor and train the Afghan security forces to take the lead in the security of their country by 2014.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  by leave—I do not normally do this, but I will make a brief statement. I suspect we will hear something reasonably similar from Senator Abetz shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is incredibly sad. This was a fairly innocent motion, and none of the caveats that Senator Farrell just read into the record apply. All we are seeking to do here is give peace a chance, as it were. On 7 September 2001 the UN General Assembly passed resolution 55/282 declaring that the International Day of Peace should be observed annually on the fixed date of 21 September as a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence. Senator Farrell made it sound as though he was concerned to hear the Senate calling for Australian troops to sit on their hands while they were shot at in any number of the war zones we are engaged in at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the motion does no such thing. It calls on the government to 'support the observation of a ceasefire by not engaging in hostilities for the duration of 21 September, unless provoked to do so in self-defence'. I would not have thought it was too much to ask for one day to remind this chamber that we have put people in harm's way and that we are a country at war at the moment, and to perhaps take today to not engage in acts of aggression in any of the places where that might be possible. Of course, mostly our thoughts go to Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was extremely ironic that most senators—in fact, the entire chamber—were entirely content to vote for the motion until the President, of all people, drew to their attention the fact that it might actually mean something. At that point they abashedly shuffled over to the other side of the chamber to crush it. I think that is a sad state of affairs, and I urge the Senate to recon­sider. Next year, on 21 September 2012, we will move a motion similar to this one to remind senators that there are people in conflict zones in our name at the moment who should be brought home.</span>

I think one thing we can all agree on in this chamber is that we all support and pray for peace in our time. No-one has a mortgage on that aspira­tion. However, the coalition does join with Senator Farrell in relation to his comments as they relate to our situation in Afghanistan, so I do not need to delay by repeating those comments except to say that we agree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another theatre of war is currently in Libya. Of course, we know that Colonel Gaddafi's troops are on the retreat. They are being pressed hard. They would want nothing more than a day of peace to regroup to ensure that they cannot be defeated. The wording of the motion includes 'unless provoked to do so in self-defence'. Those liberation fighters who are seeking to press the advantage as we speak would be required to withhold for a whole day, which of course would have given an inappropriate advantage to the evil Gaddafi regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is another example that echoes and builds on that which Senator Farrell so properly put to the chamber. So we as a coalition do support the sentiments and comments of the government in relation to this; that it in no way detracts from Labor's commitment or the coalition's commitment to peace in our time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I thank the Senate for agreeing that there is in fact an urgent need to discuss the implications of the disaster in Japan and at this important meeting being held at the UN tomorrow. The issue on Japan's Pacific coast is ongoing. It is vastly worse than most people realise and it will be smouldering for decades. This is an appropriate time, just after the six-month anniversary, to be considering it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As reported by the ABC today, 60 per cent of Japanese people surveyed want the Japanese government to rely less on nuclear energy. It is a stunning turnaround from the popularity of this technology. That is why 50,000 people took to the streets of Tokyo this week to demand the phase-out of nuclear energy in Japan. It is not difficult to understand why, given the extraordinary devastation visited on the people of Hiro­shima and Nagasaki, victims of radiation are calling for an end not just to nuclear weapons but to the civil nuclear industry. They know better than anyone. The Japanese have experienced this tragedy before. The majority of Japanese feel this way because they now know that 76 trillion becquerel of plutonium 239 have been released. This is a hideously dangerous radioactive isotope that the Japanese government thought had been contained. That figure was released on 6 June and is 23,000 times higher than had been previously announced by the Japanese government. The truth about this disaster still has not been told, even though it may have faded from the front pages of Australian newspapers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Japanese people also know that the IAEA and the Japanese government have done medical tests on children living in three towns near Fukushima. About 45 per cent of those surveyed—kids up to 15 years old—have had thyroid exposure to radioactive iodine. As we all know, radioactive iodine is something that children and babies are much more susceptible to. They are doing tests on products such as spinach, tea, milk and fish, hundreds of kilometres from the plant, that show them heavily contaminated with iodine and caesium.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that senators probably did not know is that the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, announced a High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety and Security on 11 May, a couple of months after the disaster. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have to reevaluate nuclear risks and nuclear safety in response to the disaster in Japan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed we do. He told reporters at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This exercise will also need a serious global debate on broader issues, including assessment of the costs, risks and benefits of nuclear energy and stronger connections between nuclear safety, nuclear security and nuclear non-proliferation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something the industry is very keen to not talk about at all. I understand the UNSG was visited by several governments after making these statements. What is called a 'demarche' took place, a coordinated diplomatic onslaught from countries heavily invested in nuclear power that do not want the disaster on Japan's Pacific coast to impact popular opinion or the fortunes of the industry in their countries. They were not happy that the SG wanted to have a dialogue on the costs and risks of nuclear power. Despite opposition to this meeting and the concerns of the secretary-general, on 16 September 2011 the secretary-general released the <span style="font-style:italic;">UN system-wide study on the implications of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant</span>. I indicated to the whips that I was going to seek leave to table this document, so I do so now.</span>

                  </a>  Picking up on the tension between nuclear states and the UN Secretary-General, and fearing that the meeting might become imbalanced or even manipulated by the industry, non-govern­ment organisations and experts came together to provide analysis and country reports, including a report on Australia. The effort was coordinated by Ray Acheson, the Director of Reaching Critical Will, a great project of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. They produced what is sometimes referred to as a 'shadow report', an alternative to the official report, to make sure, essentially, that updated information and evidence on the costs and risks of nuclear power are available. For the benefit of Senator Abetz and the opposition whip, I foreshadow that I will also seek leave to table that report later—so that is one report from the United Nations Secretary-General and one shadow report from the non-govern­ment organisations who pay very close regard to what is going on in those inter­national fora. The title of the shadow report is <span style="font-style:italic;">Costs, risks, and myths of nuclear power</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN report includes inputs from 16 UN entities whose work is affected by the disaster at the Fukushima plant. Unfortunate­ly, the IAEA was tasked with being the lead coordinating entity for the study. The IAEA, of course, is responsible for promoting the use of nuclear energy around the world. Having an organisation with such conflicted responsibilities coordinating the study resulted—I do not think any senators will be surprised—in the study being overwhelm­ingly and conclusively pro nuclear power. All the same, it does clearly acknowledge the severity of the disaster at Fukushima and the threat of international nuclear incidents elsewhere. It acknowledges the inadequacy of current threat assessments and mitigation planning, including risks from severe and unpredictable weather events related to climate change, which is very interesting. It acknowledges the lack of an agreed approach to facility decommissioning and high-level radioactive waste manage­ment. It acknow­ledges the weapons prolifer­ation links related to nuclear power. All these are things that I doubt senators, particularly those on the conservative side—but I know they have got their allies in the ALP as well—would acknowledge, topics they do not want to understand: weapons proliferation and the threats posed by climate change to nuclear energy, which is some­thing to ponder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The study also cautions against the trend towards longer service lives of nuclear plants. The only thing I would want less than to live next to a nuclear plant would be to live next to one that had been running for 60 years, but of course the industry, which can no longer afford to build new ones in places like the United States and Western Europe is relicensing old facilities for an additional 20 years. These things will have been running for longer than the lives of any of the people operating them, in order to squeeze more of a profit out of clapped-out assets. I think it is a shocking risk to play like that with the lives of people in those communities and the surrounding areas and countries. The study says that plant extension:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… brings its own challenges, such as ensuring that safety margins remain adequate. The extension of the lives of existing nuclear plants and the expansion of nuclear power programs are also placing an increasing strain upon the limited human resources available to design, construct, maintain and operate nuclear facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These cautions are being written by the international agency charged with promoting nuclear energy. It is a pretty lukewarm endorsement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN study also insists that the environmental, social and economic conse­quences of major accidents must also be considered and included in decision-making processes to identify and consider such costs—precisely the kinds of risks that have been ignored around the world. This recommendation has been taken up in the shadow report by the NGOs, by Australia's Dave Sweeney and Dimity Hawkins, who between them have many, many years of experience in analysing this sector. The report says that since some states 'remain committed to developing or acquiring nuclear power', disaster risk analysis 'must therefore ensure that nuclear plants are built and operated safely and able to withstand any possible threat that could give rise to a radiation emergency'. Surely by now we know that such an assurance is not possible. Dr MV Ramana points out, in his chapter on nuclear safety: 'Catastrophic accidents are inevitable with nuclear power.' We have seen that now just in the limited period of time that these plants have been operating entire areas have been depopulated and turned into radiation sacrifice zones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what position will Australia take to the meeting in New York tomorrow? We have a strong interest in this. Nobody wants nuclear power in this country, apart from Ziggy Switkowski and a handful of others, but Australia has 40 per cent of the world's uranium reserves and is a supplier of around 20 per cent of the global market, including to most of the world's nuclear weapon states. Ministers in both of the old parties obsess about uranium mining, despite it not being in our top 16 exports. The facts here in Australia are that Australian uranium mines have an absolutely miserable record. The BHP Olympic Dam mine that they are proposing to expand will create five cubic kilometres of radioactive tailings—a radio­active carcinogenic mountain range created by the expansion of one single project. The Ranger mine that senators will be aware of and have had a long association with has seen over 200 leaks, spills and licence breaches since it opened in 1981.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The meeting in New York tomorrow should be a thorough examination of the facts rather than assurances and glib assertions that deny the fact that the state of nuclear safety is as poor as its market prospects. That is why investors have deserted the sector. The meeting should not deny that the nuclear industry is rife with accidents, incidents and profound secrecy. It should not deny that nuclear power is a massive subsidy parasite that burns money far more efficiently than it burns uranium. I very much look forward to the contributions of other senators to this debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">):</span>  The Tohoku Pacific earthquake struck in the western Pacific Ocean, 72 kilometres north-east of the Tohoku peninsula in Japan, at 2.46 pm on 11 March this year. It registered a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale, making it the most powerful known earthquake to hit Japan since records began. The earthquake triggered very destructive tsunami waves of up to 40 metres high that in some cases travelled 10 kilometres inland. In addition to the extraordinarily tragic loss of over 15,000 lives, with thousands still missing, and the destruction of vital infrastructure, the tsuna­mi breached the six-metre high seawall protecting the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, badly damaging the site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The inundation of the site resulted in the automatic shutdown of three reactors; three other reactors were already shutdown due to maintenance at the time of the earthquake. Back-up diesel generators started emergency operation when power was lost but soon failed due to the damage that was caused by the tsunami. Back-up battery power with a limited life of eight to 24 hours was expended. That left the plant without vital power to operate the cooling pumps of the reactors. Of course, all senators know what happened next: three reactors had a partial meltdown, resulting in explosions and the release of harmful radiation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fukushima accident, triggered by a natural disaster of such great magnitude, reaffirms the importance of continually reviewing and improving the level of nuclear safety internationally. It also highlights the importance of the work of organisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agen­cy—it has the difficult acronym of IAEA; try saying that quickly!—as well as, here in Australia, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office and the Australian Radiation Protect­ion and Nuclear Safety Agency. As far as Australia goes, there is no choice. We must continue to work closely with other countries to strengthen nuclear safety and security and to promote international best practice. Simp­ly put, the international community must work collaboratively to improve nuclear safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Fukushima accident, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Secretary-General have been coordinating improvements in nuclear safety internationally. The Secretary-General's high-level meeting on nuclear safety and security, as we have heard from Senator Ludlam, is scheduled for tomorrow in New York. I think that is during the UN General Assembly leaders week. Also this week, the IAEA is holding its annual general confer­ence in Vienna, where nuclear safety is a central theme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May this year, Australia's foreign minister, Mr Rudd, outlined a number of ways to increase international action on nuclear safety. He explained the need for greater international oversight of nuclear safety under IAEA auspices through countries operating nuclear power plants and other facilities concluding bilateral safety agreements with the IAEA and through expansion of the IAEA's inspection role to encompass nuclear safety auditing. Mr Rudd has also proposed: augmented cooperation on emergency response and consequence management, including through the IAEA appointing an independent panel of internat­ional experts who could analyse incidents and provide advice on dealing with them; encouraging industry to share in-house compliance techniques; and cooperation by Australia with potential new nuclear energy entrants in our region. Elaborating on that vision of the foreign minister's, Australia presented a nonpaper to the June IAEA ministerial conference articulating actions the international community could take to address gaps in the current safety arrange­ments. Those actions include IAEA coordin­ated independent fact-finding and review missions into nuclear incidents, and IAEA coordinated nuclear safety missions, as well as better national reporting through the Con­vention on Nuclear Safety national reports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that Australia has contributed $100,000 to the IAEA for a study on marine impacts of radiation from the Fukushima power plant. I note that the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, of which the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Radia­tion Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA, Dr Carl-Magnus Larsson, is Australia's representative and vice-chair, is undertaking a program of work to address the source term, dispersion, deposition, health effects and environmental effects of the Fukushima accident, with a view to having an interim report produced in 2012—next year—and a final report available by 2013. I do think that it is beneficial to Australia that representatives of ARPANSA, ANSTO and ASNO are active members of the IAEA committees covering safety and security standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the story of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant tells us anything, it is to reinforce in the most stark and tragic way how important nuclear safety is for all countries. The international community must continue to improve nuclear safety. It must learn the terrible lessons of the Fukushima accident and its aftermath. The High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety taking place tomorrow in New York is critical and I hope it will play a critical role in this important work. It is expected to endorse the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety that was conceived by the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety as the basis for important future work in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do remain confident that the current Australian government will continue to play a leading role in promoting tangible measures to improve nuclear safety around the world.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  Tomorrow the United Nations will be hosting a discussion on nuclear safety and security at the initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General. In the UN jargon, this is a high-level meeting. The meeting has its genesis in the unfortunate events in Japan last year. In preparation for the meeting a system-wide study was undertaken on the implications of the Fukushima accident. A solid 43-page document was issued in relation to this on 16 August this year. As a result, participating countries have had over one month to study the document. Can I say as an aside that that is refreshing given that this government only provided a Senate committee with a few minutes in relation to Treasury modelling on carbon tax. I never thought that I would hear myself say, 'Look at the United Nations for due process and proper procedure,' but when it comes to that, with all its flaws, the United Nations clearly is way ahead of this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the document that was circulated, in plenty of time for tomorrow's discussion, I note a number of observations. First of all, amongst other things, the document acknowledges the contribution that safe and scientifically sound nuclear technologies make to the agriculture and food production industries. So the nuclear sector is vital to the world's food task. If we want to deal with action on poverty we need a sensible, balanced approach to nuclear power. Indeed, in paragraph 16 of the United Nations report of the Secretary-General, we are told:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Providing access to energy for the 2.4 billion people currently living in energy poverty is an important precondition for progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then it goes on to say—and I want to stress this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All—</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I underline 'all'—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">energy sources and technologies will be required to meet that enormous challenge. Nuclear power has been and will remain a significant contributor to meeting global energy needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thus achieving the Millennium Development Goals in fighting poverty. Indeed, we could move on to paragraph 88 of the report where, in relation to climate change, it says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… one of the benefits of nuclear power is its very low greenhouse gas emissions, which help reduce all risks associated with climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would invite the Greens to take a more balanced approach, as indeed the United Nations have, in relation to the issues that the world confronts following the unfortunate events in Japan last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, we have heard Senator Ludlam and others from the Greens condemn the nuclear industry, by saying it is a thing of the past and it is a dying industry. Indeed, Senator Ludlum said, 'Nuclear is a declining industry, it is a dying industry and there is no turning back,' and phrases of that nature. If you actually turn to the United Nations document that I have in front of me, you will see that paragraph 17 is very informative:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As of July 2011, some 440 nuclear power reactors were operating in 29 countries, with 65 new reactors under construction. Interest in nuclear power, although impacted by the accident at the Fukushima … nuclear power plant, remains high. Of the countries without nuclear power that before the accident had strongly indicated their intentions to proceed with nuclear power programmes, only a few have cancelled or revised their plans, but most have not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the reality of the world situation. No matter how the Greens come into this debate and try to spin, that is the reality. Anything that relates to nuclear gets the Greens up in arms, gets them on the front foot and on the attack. So if we were to call the 'nuclear family' the 'natural family' I wonder whether the Greens would be somewhat more supportive of the more traditional family role model. But I digress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having taken that slight whack at the Australian Greens, I can indicate that the coalition does not have any opposition to the two documents that Senator Ludlam sought to have tabled. So, if the Greens were to renew their request through their next speaker, the coalition would not oppose that request. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We ask for a sensible debate in this country. We are willing to sell our uranium to other countries in the world but not use it ourselves for power production. Until we get bipartisanship support on that, I doubt it will happen in Australia. But it is the same attitude that the Labor Party takes to coal. We export our coal, without a tax, for other people to burn—that is morally okay—but we are not allowed to burn our own coal in Australia without putting a huge carbon tax on it, putting ourselves at a disadvantage. You really have to wonder about government policy on these matters. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="ka5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MILNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  I rise today to congratulate Senator Ludlam on bringing this matter of public importance to the Senate, because very few Australians would be aware that there is a very high-level meeting on nuclear safety and security to be held tomorrow, 22 September, at the United Nations headquarters in response to a call by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, following the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. I am delighted that we have this opportunity to discuss the UN report. I congratulate, again, Senator Ludlam for tabling the report that will be discussed at that high-level meeting. I would urge senators to read the report and consider it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, earlier this year, on 18 April, the Secretary-General of the United Nations called for a global rethink of nuclear energy and safety. After the Fukushima disaster, people around the world began to really think about the implications of a major nuclear disaster. I note that, in recent days, the former Japanese Prime Minister came out saying that he sought advice in the early days after the disaster of what it would take if Tokyo, with its 30 million people, had to be evacuated. That is what he was grappling with in the first days after the disaster and has subsequently said that the power company involved was extremely unhelpful in providing the kinds of details that he needed to know in thinking about and making those kinds of plans. But think about it for a moment: imagine a situation in a developed country, such as Japan, where somebody has to think about moving 30 million people and what it would mean. As he said, it would mean that Japan would cease to exist and operate as a nation-state during a period where you are trying to manage that kind of disaster. It is worth actually considering that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Senator Abetz was very selective in the way that he responded to this matter. He noted, for example, in relation to food, that one of the UN agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, did contribute in the section on agriculture and food security about the contribution of nuclear energy and nuclear technology for food security. But the report also recognised that a nuclear accident involving the release of radioactive material will result in:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… serious radioactive contamination of water, agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry productions as well as wildlife, thus posing a serious threat to veterinary and public health, food security and trade, with direct implications on the livelihoods of people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us get that absolutely straight: a nuclear accident of this kind will lead to contamination and will have massive health and also food security impacts, as we have seen with the level of contamination of food in the immediate area of Fukushima. In relation to the achievement of the Millen­nium Development Goals, Senator Abetz quotes that the IAEA suggests that the provision of access to energy for the 2.4 billion people currently living in energy poverty is an important precondition for progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We totally agree. Energy is important in delivering the Millen­nium Development Goals, but nuclear power is not the answer to doing that, because we are talking here about costs and risks, and in fact it is distributed energy produced by renewable energy that has a much greater opportunity and chance to be able to relieve poverty. I put it this way: in the UNDP report they note that sustainable development will require the cost per megawatt hour of electricity to be less than three per cent of per capita income. Since the majority of those in need of energy live in countries where annual per capita incomes are under $1,000, the need is for technological options in the range of $30-$50 per megawatt hour. With nuclear you are not going to get it anywhere under $100, if not more as we go into the greater risk parameters that you are going to have to pay for if you are going to try and develop nuclear energy. So what we should be doing is opposing the idea that you would try and drive nuclear energy, central­ised systems requiring governments to underwrite them in terms of cost, posing difficulties for local communities. Instead, you would support Australian technology in thin film solar, for example, which is a new and exciting area of solar. It is now biodegradable and is entirely consistent with aspirations for providing energy to develop­ing countries. We will see that Australian technology roll out over time and we going to see it make a big difference in the developing world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On climate change, there is this ridiculous assertion that nuclear energy is required to address climate change. It is actually the opposite. In this report it states that the assumptions that need to be reviewed are regarding the types of accidents that are possible. The report says that an assessment of those accidents was way too modest and that they need to look at the possible effects of climate change in relation to nuclear energy. That is because nuclear cannot take the heat. We have seen right around the world in the last decade several occasions where nuclear reactors have had to be closed down because of extreme heat conditions, which will be increasing as the rate of climate change accelerates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you a few examples. In July 2010 in Alabama we saw the shutdown of nuclear facilities to the point where it cost that energy agency or energy department $50 million, all of which had to be paid for by customers in Tennessee, when they had to close down the reactors because they could not cool them, there was no water to be able to do it, and also they could not dispose of the hot water into river systems which were already depleted. At about the same time we had exactly the same situation in Europe. For example, in the summer of 2003 during those record-breaking heatwaves millions of people across France and Italy suffered through extended power shortages after the French network of 19 nuclear power plants had to reduce their operations. Seventy per cent of France's electricity comes from nuclear power. Italy also purchases about a third of its electricity from French nuclear providers. During the heatwave those countries had to basically cut down on use and promote energy conservation. There were blackouts and the result was that many aged people, hospitals and so on experienced those blackouts, and it was appalling. That is why France is now one of the countries in Europe most rapidly embracing renewable energy technology, because they recognise that in extreme weather events nuclear is no good, the reactor has to be shut down.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us get this very straight: rather than being a solution to climate change, nuclear is actually significantly undermined by climate change. The coalition does not want to address climate change, but we are going to have more extreme weather events in Australia, more high-temperature days. It is completely unsuitable technology in this country. But I do want on the record that Senator Abetz reiterated that it is coalition policy to build nuclear reactors in Australia. He still has not said where he would build them—</span>

                  </a>  Senator Abetz said that. Just a few minutes ago he said that as far as he was concerned the Labor Party is not wanting to support nuclear reactors, clearly the Greens do not, and he was hoping that that would be rethought. It is coalition policy and Senator Abetz has made it clear. In the face of climate change, getting nuclear reactors is so ridiculous, and in face of the disaster that has been Fukushima it is strange that anybody could be talking about promoting nuclear energy. There we had Ziggy Switkowski doing just that. He did not go and stand outside Fukushima, though, did he, when he was busy talking about the low level of risk. He should have gone straight there if it were so low-level risk. But no, it is the Japanese people who are suffering because of this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that at this meeting in the United Nations tomorrow they will not only consider this but look at the IAEA and say that this organisation needs to split its responsibilities for looking at nuclear proli­feration and for its promotion of nuclear as a technology. They need to split the regulatory authority from the promotion, and that is one of the very positive things that should come out of this meeting tomorrow.</span>

                  <a href="G0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  In rising to make a contribution to this debate I acknowledge that Senator Ludlam has had a longstanding and serious interest in, and opposition to, nuclear energy. He has not yet succumbed to the hysteria and hyperbole that we just heard from Senator Milne. Senator Milne was on about how nuclear was unreliable, and I can only presume that her endorsement of renewable energy has conveniently overlooked the fact that the recent high winds in the UK forced them to close down the wind farms there because they were at risk of collapse and catching on fire and actually overpowering the electricity grid. I also note that Senator Milne criticised Dr Switkowski for not standing in front of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan to make his announce­ments about the safety of nuclear energy. I also note that Senator Milne has not been standing in front of the geothermal tech­nology company in South Australia, where one exploded recently. Let us call this for what it is. It is another scaremongering tactic by an extreme green movement that is seeking to exploit a tragic circumstance and a very dangerous circumstance—I will acknowledge that—for their own base ends. There is no doubt that what happened in Japan was bad. It was a disaster for the Japanese people but we have to look at the fact that this reactor was built on old technology—40-year-old technology. Clear­ly it was built in the wrong place and without due consideration of the earthquake risk and the tsunami risk that it was placed under. All of these things can be overcome if you can overcome an irrational fear of nuclear energy. But, of course, the Greens specialise in irrational fear to pursue equally irrational policy agendas. Senator Ludlam, as I said, has not quite succumbed to that as yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Greens clearly want a baseload power system built on the most unreliable of technologies, which is renewable energy technology. We know it is prohibitively expensive. We know that it will not provide for Australia's base power needs. And it is startling to hear Senator Milne defend the provision of electricity to people all over the world when the Greens and Senator Milne herself want to basically shut down our baseload power generation capacity in Australia. Make no mistake: this is part of the Greens policy agenda. They do not want to see any new coalmines. They do not want to see any more coal fired power stations. But this is only part of their extreme policy agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Might I remind this Senate that Senator Bob Brown, the Leader of the Greens, actually wanted and has previously called for a registration system for businesses based on the religious belief of their owners. This was rapidly removed from the Greens website, but I still have the press release. Senator Bob Brown wanted to have a register of businesses based on the religious belief of the owners. This is the same organisation that promotes and supports boycotts of businesses that do business with Israel or that are owned by Jewish business owners. This is an extreme agenda that is very damaging to Australia because it does not confront the reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the hypocrisy of the Greens has been demonstrated over and over again. I remember when Senator Bob Brown was quoted as saying: 'People do not make large donations to political parties without having in mind favour in return.' I wonder what you get when you take the largest corporate political donation in the history of this country. There have been some suggest­ions—it is just a coincidence, we know—that when Senator Bob Brown rose and asked a number of questions in this place that were directly relevant to the business interests of that $1.6 million donor to the Greens, accusations of hypocrisy and accusations of conflict of interest could have been levelled. But, of course, the Greens washed their hands of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention these things because we need to put it in perspective: the Greens are an alarmist movement that will seek to trade and profit from human misery because that will suit their political agenda. Their agenda is, quite frankly, one that wants to reduce human kind to just another species amongst species. We are the same as rabbits and monkeys and anything else. Once again, that is in the Greens manifesto, which was written by Bob Brown and that man, Peter Singer, in 1996. It effectively equates humans with just about every other animal species. Little wonder they want to shut down the embracement of technology that can actually supply Australia's and the world's electricity needs in a manner that is consistent with the global desire to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They make no bones about that, notwithstanding what Senator Milne said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear energy is one of the few low-emissions technologies that can provide baseload power. We know that. It has worked elsewhere in the world. Senator Milne in her rush to criticise nuclear power all over the world conveniently overlooked the fact that the nuclear industry in somewhere like France supplies a lot of western Europe with their electricity needs. Indeed, you would not have the opportunity to use as much electricity in places like Italy without France's provisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be aware of what the real agenda is here. It is not about the national interest. It is not about Australia's interest or about provisioning, protecting, defending or preparing ourselves for the requirements of future generations. This is about pursuing an ideological agenda. The tragedy in Japan is simply part of that. It is no doubt a tragedy. It is something that we will have to learn from, but it is not the reason that we should shut the door to examining the application of nuclear energy and its respective benefits right around the world, and that includes here, in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to what the Senate has been told, it is not coalition policy to build nuclear power plants. We acknowledge that nuclear should be examined as a potential solution that is consistent with our desire to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but we cannot pursue this policy agenda without bipartisan agreement. Everyone acknowledges that. We know also that the Labor Party is not party to that agreement yet, because clearly the Greens tail is wagging the dog. Although, I do note that clear thinkers like Martin Ferguson MP have tried to put this on the ALP policy agenda. So I say to Australians: they should not succumb to this green— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  He has got his own set of friends, although Deputy President Marshall might be more informed than I am on the Balkanised ways of the Victorian Labor Party. But we are not here today to talk about that issue; that should be for another day. We are here today to talk about Senator Ludlam's MPI. The starting point might be to recall that, 25 years ago, we had the Chernobyl tragedy, which occurred in what was then part of the Soviet Union and is now the state of Ukraine. What we saw in March this year with Japan's Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima reaffirmed the importance of sound nuclear emergency response mechanisms and the highest possible standards of nuclear safety.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would particularly like to talk today about Australia's initial response to the Japanese disaster. In the immediate wake of the earthquake and tsunami, the Australian government responded extremely quickly to ensure the safety of Australians in Japan as well as to offer assistance to the Japanese government and, more particularly, the people of Japan. The Australian government, on behalf the Australian people, donated $10 million to the Australian Red Cross Japan and Pacific Disaster Appeal and provided very early and extensive support. Part of that support included a 72-person urban search-and-rescue team with two sniffer dogs, which was one of the first overseas teams on the ground in Japan. In addition, a 22-strong Defence team participated in Australia's response. We sent three Royal Australian Air Force C17 aircraft and airlifted a total of over 450 tonnes of cargo over 12 days to support the relief operation in Japan. Two of those RAAF C17 aircraft were also used to transport specialised pumping equipment from Perth to Japan, with Australian technicians who helped to set up the equip­ment and provide the training for using them to the Japanese technicians. The pumping equipment directly contributed to efforts to stabilise the situation at the Daiichi nuclear power plant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred and fifty Australia based and locally engaged staff provided consular support, and coordinated information and support with Japanese officials, through our embassy in Tokyo. Australia also deployed consular staff to Sendai as soon as it was possible after the tsunami. We were in fact the first team to be deployed in the area and the last to depart. In total, over 230 Australian officials served in Japan to provide consular services to Australians and to assist Japan with its very difficult recovery efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crisis centre at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—and I have had some experience with them in recent times—received over 11,000 phone calls over the period of the crisis. The Australian govern­ment was able to confirm the safety of 5,239 Australians in Japan, including 417 in the tsunami and quake affected areas of the country. All the Australians of whom DFAT was aware were accounted for and, thank­fully, there were no Australian casualties. So often, when these sorts of tragedies overseas occur, Australians are involved; but on this occasion, importantly, there were no Austra­lian casualties suffered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is taking a very active role in the broader international action on nuclear safety. In terms of the broader implications of the Fukushima accident, the Australian government recognises the importance of the international community working collaborat­ively to improve nuclear safety through the promotion of best-practice standards. We just heard Senator Faulkner talk about some of these initiatives. They include, firstly, greater international oversight of nuclear safety, including through the bilateral safety agreements with the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and their nuclear safety auditing; secondly, better international coordination of emergency response and consequent management; thirdly, encourag­ing industry to share in-house safety standard compliance techniques; and, fourthly, coop­eration from Australia with, potentially, new nuclear energy market entrants in our region.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a meeting of the IAEA. They hosted a conference on nuclear safety that was held in Vienna in June.

                  </a>  The paper that Australia presented to the conference in Vienna addressed what we considered to be gaps in safety arrangements and outlined actions to address them. These included independent fact-finding and review mis­sions for nuclear incidents—again, to be coordinated by the IAEA; nuclear safety missions, also coordinated by the IAEA; and improved national reporting under the provi­sions of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. That IAEA meeting endorsed a vision for improvements in the form of a practical action plan on nuclear safety. That action plan incorporated a number of ideas advan­ced by Australia and our foreign minister for improving nuclear safety. Those included, firstly, the IAEA conducting fact-finding missions when nuclear accidents occur and publishing those results; secondly, an expan­sion of the IAEA's nuclear safety review role; and, thirdly, greater transparency by states in reporting their nuclear safety activities.</span>

Australia hopes that the meeting will formally endorse that action plan. Importantly, the action plan recognises that all countries have a stake in nuclear safety, whether or not they have nuclear programs of their own. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  My colleagues have previously spoken about safety and the importance of ensuring that nuclear power plants have the appropriate safety mechan­isms. I endorse those comments. I also endorse the comments that Senator Abetz made before me about the need to have a balanced consideration of this matter. Of course, we are all concerned about what happened and the disaster that happened at Fukushima as a consequence of the tsunami. But the other side of the equation is that nuclear power is the source of energy for millions of people around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does need to be a balanced debate, but balanced is certainly something the Greens are not. Senator Abetz mentioned the United Nations report and cited some statistics from it. It is clear that the Greens do not have a very balanced view as far as nuclear energy is concerned. Their policies are about a nuclear-free Australia. Indeed, they are about a nuclear-free world. One only has to look at their policies to see just how extreme they are. For example, they want to close the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. Forget the probably millions of people in Australia who have had the benefits of nuclear medicine over time and the good things that the existence of that reactor has been able to provide to Australians on a daily basis. Forget all of this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at some of these extreme policies of the Greens. We know about the formal alliance with the Gillard government and the influence of the Greens now that they have control and the balance of power in the Senate. Bob Brown is on the record about the agenda of the Greens and I quote—</span>

                  </a>  I withdraw that. Senator Bob Brown is on the record about the agenda of the Greens. On 25 August 2008, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens are about re-creating Australia for the new century street by street, community by community, city by city.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want to transform Australia root and branch, not for the better but for the worse. Their goal stretches well beyond the introduction of a job-destroying economy-wide carbon tax that will push up prices and add further to the cost-of-living pressures under which Australian families are already struggling. Lindsay Tanner back in 2004 said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We might have the Greens with the balance of power … and in order to form government Labor might have to do some of the mad things they want.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a look at some of those loony, loony policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the economic policy from the Greens' radical agenda they talk about introducing road congestion taxes, means testing first homeowners grants, treating family trusts as companies and introducing death duties. In the energy sector they are opposed to the exploration, mining and export of uranium. They are opposed to the diesel fuel rebate. They are opposed to government funded research and development for geosequestra­tion technology. They want to shut down existing coal mines and coal fired power stations. Imagine what the cost of this will be on ordinary Australians, who are already struggling to confront the increase in electricity prices that will be brought by a carbon tax. Imagine no new coal mines, no new coal fired power stations and no expansion of existing coal mines. It was interesting to hear Senator Abetz the other day say that Senator Bob Brown has become a convert. At the time of the Franklin dam he was happy to have a coal fired power station, but he has changed his mind since then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at their other policies in the social and community area: legalising cannabis, supporting needle and syringe exchanges, banning junk food advertising, giving 16-year-olds the right to vote and changing the national flag. In education there is the classic: freezing private school funding. How can we get across Senator Rhiannon and her extreme BDS anti-Israel stance? There is their abolishing of private health insurance. The list goes on and on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In tabling the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Alert Digest</span> No.11 of 2011, the Senate may be interested to know that the majority of the bills scrutinised for this <span style="font-style:italic;">Alert Digest</span> relate to the govern­ment's climate change package. In scrutin­ising the provisions of the 19 bills forming part of this legislative package against the principles outlined in standing order 24, the scrutiny committee has identified a number of provisions for comment. The issues raised are those typically considered by scrutiny bodies. In relation to many of the provisions, the committee had enough information available to it to outline the particular circumstances, discuss the scrutiny principle of interest and then draw the provision to the Senate's attention for further consideration. However, in relation to a few provisions, the committee is of the view that further information is required to fully understand the justification for the proposed approach. These are also outlined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alert Digest</span> and the committee will write to relevant ministers seeking advice on the points raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also take this opportunity to draw the Senate's attention to a topic of particular interest to it at present. The committee is currently focusing on practical ways in which to improve the scrutiny of uniform national legislative schemes. These schemes involve cooperation between jurisdictions and they can be founded on intergovern­mental agreements and text based referrals of legislation. The concern is that bills can be presented to parliament with advice that, for the Commonwealth to be able to rely on the referral from the states and territories, the bill cannot be substantially amended from the form in which it is first introduced. Although the parliament technically retains the right to significantly amend any bill that is before it for consideration, as this circum­stance highlights, in practical terms this is not always realistic. The scrutiny committee can provide technical advice about bills to ensure that they are consistent with scrutiny principles. This can assist to avoid legal deficiencies and subsequent challenges to legislation, but the committee's advice cannot be put to good use if it is not implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee intends drawing the issue of the scrutiny of national schemes of legislation to the attention of ministers as relevant bills are introduced. The committee will seek to work with ministers to identify effective ways in which to provide our technical expertise at an early stage in the development of cooperative scheme laws without jeopardising any proposed legisla­tive schemes. We are also considering this issue more broadly as part of our current inquiry into the committee's future role and direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the full details of the committee's views about the bills it considered this week are available in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alert Digest</span> and in the report which is being tabled today. I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Alert Digest</span> No. 11 of 2011 and the 11th report of 2011 to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Senator Bishop, the report has only just been tabled, but this is the opportunity to take note of it. I am speaking to it because there is some great irony, I find, in a discussion about proper scrutiny given the 19 climate change bills that are before us, which Senator Fifield referred to. We are seeing far from proper scrutiny of those bills. Yes, the scrutiny of bills committee has gone through its usual process and, as Senator Fifield highlighted, it has found a number of areas where there are provisions about which they have concerns. They will write to the relevant ministers, seeking additional information to justify the direction the government is taking with this legislation. That is welcome, but in other ways, and especially when considered against the normal processes of this place, these climate change bills are receiving no such appropriate scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These climate change bills are being rushed through the parliament on a fixed deadline agreed in both chambers by the Labor Party and their coalition partners in government. They have set this arbitrary deadline and, in doing so, they have set up a shotgun inquiry which is being held under the most ridiculous terms and conditions that any substantial legislative package of this type has ever been considered under. In comparison, look at what happened when the GST and the A New Tax System reforms went through this place. We saw months of genuinely independent, or at least opposition-led, inquiry into the detail of those legislative packages. Five committees were set up through this place, each of them looking, over a period of four to five months, at the detail of those bills, each of them going out and taking submissions and evidence from interested parties right around the country and each of them with a reasonable time frame in which to do all that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare and contrast that with what we have for the carbon tax. The government have introduced 19 bills into the other place and their approach to assessing and considering them has been to establish a select committee. It is not a balanced select committee, mind you, but a select committee on which the government, together with the Greens and an Independent member—all of them part of the government's coalition arrangements—overwhelmingly outnumber the representatives of the opposition. They have seized total control of the committee, appointing a Labor member as its chair and a Greens senator as its deputy chair. When the GST bills were considered, those committees were chaired by Labor senators with Labor majorities. However, so much is the govern­ment wishing to totally control this process of consideration and public debate on its carbon tax that it has had to seize total control of this committee. It has thrown out all long-standing parliamentary conventions that where a chair is from one side a deputy chair is from the other side, ensuring some semblance of balance in the organisation and coordination of the committee. It has thrown that out in favour of having their own coali­tion partners running the show with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the timing of it? The timing of it does not exactly allow for proper scrutiny either. This is a rushed committee, a rushed inquiry—it has 20-odd days from go to whoa to get the job done, to thoroughly assess and analyse the details and merits of these 19 bills and make any recommendations after taking evidence about the content of those bills. That is a virtually impossible task in such a short period. The government has set and has forced the committee to set an equally impossible task for the Australian public, because the Australian public was given just six days to make their submissions on the legislation before this parliament—Australians have been given just six days to make submissions on the 19 bills, on the more than 1,100 pages of proposed new laws for this country contained in the carbon tax legislative package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to Australians is: do not be deterred, do not be held back by the government's contempt for you and its contempt for proper commentary, proper scrutiny and proper accountability—please make sure you get your submissions in. Australians have slightly less than 24 hours now to get their submissions into this inquiry. It has been a terribly rushed process, but I would urge anybody listening to this broadcast to go onto the Parliament House website and make a submission to the committee, with of course its very spin-generated name of the Joint Select Comm­ittee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation. It is a little bit of a mouthful but I am sure anybody who wishes to make a submission will be able to find its webpage and get their voice heard no matter how hard this government tries to stifle them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, in terms of actually taking evidence and scrutinising this legislation around the country, the committee finds itself totally hamstrung by the government-Greens-Independent majority. The committee will not take evidence anywhere away from the eastern seaboard. That is a concern to me and I am sure to you too, Mr Acting Deputy President—</span>

                    </a>  And it is certainly of concern to Senator Adams as well, as it would be. The committee and coalition members have argued that we should be going west and that we should hear from the people of Western Australia who have such concern about this carbon tax. But, no, that idea has been blocked—the committee will not be going to Western Australia; it will not take evidence in my home state of South Australia either, or the Northern Territory or Tasmania. We are not quite sure yet whether the committee will even get to Queensland and perhaps hear from somebody outside one of the big cities and actually visit one of Australia's regional centres, particularly those regional centres hit so hard by the carbon tax proposal. No, the government, because of the time line it has imposed, because of the ridiculously tight time line for this committee to report, has instead put in place an arrangement where the committee will hear some evi­dence in Canberra and hear some evidence in Melbourne, and we are still arguing for one extra sitting day for this committee to take evidence into the carbon tax proposal out into the region somewhere, out into a regional area where we can hear from those interests across the agricultural sectors, the mining sectors, the exporting industries, the manufacturing industries, the tourism industries—so many of the sectors that will be directly affected by this carbon tax legi­slation and have been given such minimal time and opportunity to comment on it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even today we saw the ultimate in farce—this committee met for the first time for a public hearing and heard from government officials including officials from the Treasury. You would have thought that, in this process, the committee would have the opportunity to question officials from the Treasury about the latest Treasury modelling into the carbon tax. But, no, the government in its wisdom, despite having finished the modelling last week, despite the Treasurer drip feeding selected parts of it out on the weekend, decided not to release this model­ling until the final few minutes before the hearing commenced this morning, thereby making it nigh on impossible for the committee to properly scrutinise the Treas­ury information upon which this legislation rests.</span>

I am pleased that it has been at least able to fulfil its usual task in this legislative process. It is perhaps the only parliamentary committee that has been able to fulfil the normal process of legislation and consider the legislation—all others appear to have been stifled when it comes to scrutiny of these bills. I commend the report, as Senator Fifield did, to the chamber.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens join the government and I hope all Australians in acknowledging the second anniversary of pension reforms and the increase in the age pension. I am sure many people in this place remember all the times that Senator Brown and I and a number of other senators spoke about the need for increases in the pension rate in this country, and we campaigned very strongly for that. Of course we welcome, and we always have welcomed, the increase in the age pension. I acknowledge that this is the second anniversary. However, I draw attention to the conclusion of the statement where it says: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This government, like Labor governments before us, is driven by our belief in a fair society that rewards a lifetime of work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are driven by our sense of responsibility to ensure that no Australian is left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unfortunate situation in this country now is that we have such a differential in the series of payments for people on income support and social security. The safety net that we supposedly have built into our society with social security payments unfort­unately has some massive holes in it, and they have been perpetuated by the increase in the age pension. As I said, we totally support the increase in the age pension. We always did; we campaigned very strongly for it. But we have seen a growing disparity between those on the pension and those on allow­ances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, we now have a gap of $128 a week between Newstart and pension rates. That is a very significant amount of money. We also have a government now that is taking its 'tough love' approach to those seeking income support, for example those living with a disability and who seek support from the disability support pension. The same government that wants to see no Australian is left behind is making it even harder for people with a disability to get the disability support pension. The government is making them prove that they have tried to find a job over 18 months or to keep sustained employment over 18 months. During that period they are supposed to exist on a Newstart payment that is $128 a week less than if they received the disability support pension or the age pension. These are people living with a disability, who we are supposed to give a leg up to find a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's report on impair­ment tables—we will be debating it probably the next time we sit—it was clearly high­lighted by witnesses to the committee how difficult it was to survive on Newstart at $128 a week less than the age pension or the disability support pension. They also high­lighted how much harder it is to live with a disability and try to find work. These are people to whom we say, 'If you can work 15 hours a week, you have to continue trying to find a job for 18 months and survive on Newstart.' If you have a significant disability, it costs you a lot more money to try to find work. It is a lot more difficult to sustain work. We have seen evidence that, of the people with a disability in this cycle of trying to find work, only 16 per cent are managing to find what was termed 'sustain­able' work—in other words, work beyond 26 weeks. So people are cycling in and out of part-time work, which of course is not a full-time wage, and trying to sustain themselves from that and Newstart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great shame that we think it is okay to treat people that way, and it is a great shame that when this much-appreciated increase in the age pension went through we did not flow through those payments to those living on youth allowance, for example, and those living and trying to find a job on Newstart. While we are doing that, as I said, the government says it is trying to encourage people into work. We do not think that the process the government has set up will do that. By doing that, it is demonising people. It ensures that people are forced even further into poverty and we know that once people are in a poverty trap and have been unem­ployed long term, it is much harder to get out of that poverty trap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I make to the government is that it is all very well to pat yourselves on the back saying, 'Look what jolly good fellows we are, responding finally to community concern about the age pension,' but what are you doing about those living with a disability? What is the government doing to make sure that those on Newstart are genuinely supported and are not living in poverty? People on Newstart now have to live in poverty. You only had to listen to the radio this morning when payday lenders were discussed. The reason that people have to go to payday lenders is that they cannot afford to live. They live from week to week and have to make their social security payments stretch. They cannot, so they are forced to go to payday lenders. That is why they are being abused in that process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not ensuring that there is a minimum living payment for someone to live on. We do not recognise that people need a minimum standard on which to survive. The value of the Newstart payment is going further and further down and not only are people struggling on Newstart but also we saw during the budget process that family benefit payments were frozen. I know people think that is only a small amount of money but when you exist on only a small amount of money every dollar counts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every budget decision and every payment decision this government has made has essentially further slashed payments to those most disadvantaged in our community. I urge the government to take a proper look at the tax and transfer process during the tax forum—or summit; whatever it is called this week—so that people are guaranteed a mini­mum living wage payment. It is essential that we treat people in our community with respect and ensure that which the govern­ment says it is committed to—that no Australian is left behind and that we do have a fair society. If we do not address this issue now, our society will not be a fair one and will become more and more unfair. More and more Australians will be left behind. Question agreed to.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Crime has significant social and economic costs that undermine our safety, security and prosperity. Our increasingly global world is presenting new opportunities for criminal groups to expand their illicit enterprises beyond traditional state borders, and escape justice. This means that a high level of international cooperation is crucial to effectively combat crime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's current extradition and mutual assistance legislation was developed over 20 years ago. There was no internet in 1988 and mobile phones were a new commodity. International travel has become much more common, and the international financial system more accessible. These developments have meant that our laws no longer meet the needs of Australia's international law enforcement activities as effectively as they used to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A comprehensive review of Australia's international crime cooperation laws was therefore timely. In 2006, discussion papers were released for public consultation that proposed fundamental reforms to Australia's international crime cooperation laws and procedures, including in the areas of extradition and mutual assistance. The concept of this Bill evolved out of that review and drafts of the Bill were released for public consultation in 2009, and again in January this year. Over 40 submissions were received and the Government has carefully considered the views raised in both consultation processes in developing the final version of this Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Essentially, the Bill has two key objectives: to streamline and modernise the process for extradition, and to ensure Australian authorities can offer a comprehensive range of assistance to our international criminal justice partners.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Faster and simpler surrender procedures will ensure that accused persons avoid unnecessary delays and this will also assist Australia to fulfil its international obligation to secure the return of alleged offenders to face justice, promptly and efficiently.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The process for extraditing a person can be cumbersome and take several months to finalise, even if a person has consented to their extradition. The Bill will allow a person, who consents to being extradited, to waive the extradition process subject to certain safeguards. The Bill will allow a person, once arrested, to immediately elect to remove him or herself from the extradition process and be surrendered to the foreign country. As not all stages of the extradition process would be required to be completed, the extradition process will be significantly streamlined where a person elects to waive extradition. Although this will mean that not all stages of the extradition process will need to be completed, the safeguards built into the extradition regime will still apply. Firstly, a magistrate must be satisfied that the person understands the consequences of waiving extradition. Secondly, despite a person waiving the right to be subject to the extradition process, the Minister would not be able to surrender the person if the person would be in danger of torture or subject to the death penalty.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 23 August I gave notice of the Greens' intention to move this disallowance to the Migration Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 4) after numerous community legal centres and pro bono lawyers contacted my office deeply concerned about the impact that this regulation would have on their current and prospective clients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of the Migration Amend­ment Regulations 2011 (No. 4), which came into effect on 1 July, introduces serious financial restrictions on access to justice for people experiencing some form of financial hardship. Up until 1 July the Migration Review Tribunal had the power to waive the application fee for merits review if the payment would cause financial hardship. However, changing the existing 1994 migra­tion regulations will mean the Migration Review Tribunal can reduce the fee by only 50 per cent. In other words, they now only have the power to reduce the $1,540 fee by half to $770, if they are satisfied that the payment of the fee has caused or is likely to cause severe financial hardship to the review applicant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere in the explanatory memorandum does the minister explain why these dramatic changes are necessary. While the statement highlights that the purpose of this regulation is to charge applicants a reduced fee if the payment would cause severe financial hardship, it fails to highlight that previously a full waiver was available. This I suggest is somewhat disingenuous and, dare I say it, sneaky. While the accompanying statement does not state that this change would have no impact or effect on business or competition, it fails to summarise the likely impact on individuals who are directly involved, which of course will be considerable. This is about whether or not people get to live in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens do not see there being any justification for slashing the fee waiver for applicants seeking a review of their visa decision. Given that the criteria for the tribunal to reduce the fee are based on evidence that the applicant would have to face severe financial hardship, it is ridiculous that someone who is assessed as being unable to pay over $1,500 could somehow still be able to pay $770. Apparently $1,500 is unacceptable but $770 is okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again community legal centres and access to justice advocates have stressed the importance of being able to offer complete fee waivers where the situation is warranted. The problem with this regulation is that without payment of the tribunal fee the application for merits review is deemed invalid. So if you cannot cough up the $770 you cannot even lodge an application to have your case reviewed. This could result in a significant number of vulnerable individuals, who previously would have been considered for a complete fee waiver, now being unable to raise the required $770 reduced fee in order to access the review. So it is only if you have enough money that you can access the legal system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010-11 the Migration Review Tribu­nal granted 511 fee waivers, highlighting its importance in ensuring access to justice is available for vulnerable individuals. This figure is increasingly important when comparing the application fee of the Migration Review Tribunal to other types of merit reviews of Commonwealth agency decisions. For example, no fees apply to either the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which looks at Centrelink decisions, or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So for some tribunals you may have to pay a fee but there is nothing beyond a basic fee of $75. Applicants who would like to see a review of a decision by the Migration Review Tribunal have to pay $1,500. They could get a waiver to $770 but anybody else appealing to other Commonwealth agencies does not have to pay anywhere in that vicinity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of legal experts, who I understand have contacted the minister's office expressing their concerns over this regulation, have indicated that the inability of Migration Review Tribunal to waive the application fee will have an adverse effect on both Australian citizens and permanent resi­dents, along with a variety of individuals seeking to obtain or retain a particular visa. The following case clearly identifies the impact that this regulation could have on individuals residing or wanting to reside in Australia. A woman who came to Australia on a temporary partner visa, who had an Australian citizen husband, separated from him due to serious domestic violence. As she is on a temporary visa, she is not eligible for ongoing Centrelink payments and is living on her cousin's couch. Wanting to remain in Australia because she has been here for some time—she has family connections, she has social connections—she contacted DIAC who informed her that, if she provided evidence of her domestic violence, then she may be able to stay on her current visa. However, as the woman did not receive any professional migration advice, she failed to provide evidence from the approved persons list and her visa was subsequently refused. She of course needed this decision reviewed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only option available to appeal this decision is through the Migration Review Tribunal. As the woman does not have $1,540, nor the $770 she would require even if it were agreed that the payment of the fee would cause financial hardship, the option of appealing is not a live one. A decision like this could be seen as directly in conflict with the intention of the domestic violence provisions in the migration legislation—to allow people to leave violent relationships without jeopardising their immigration status. The minister has refused to outline and answer this question—the rationale for why we would want to undermine our obligations in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Community Legal Centres New South Wales, access to the Migration Review Tribunal is not a futile exercise. With more than 40 per cent of all DIAC decisions reviewed by the tribunal reversed to a positive decision, that means only 36 per cent of all previous decisions were upheld. That is a pretty bad strike rate for the depart­ment of immigration in the first instance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decisions made by DIAC are incredibly important and affect the lives of applicants and their sponsors. By removing the fee waiver right of the tribunal, this regulation will effectively prevent financially disad­vantaged individuals from seeking merits review due to the increase in cost. And yet again, there is no argument put forward by the minister as to why this is the case. The only argument which has been flagged is of course one of cost savings. If we accept that it is unreasonable to expect someone who would face severe financial hardship to have to pay $1,540, how can we expect the very same person to fork out $770 just to have a review of a negative decision? With limited consultation with the legal sector and the introduction of this regulation, and the adverse impact which this may have on some of their clients, I would urge all senators to reconsider their opposition to this disallow­ance motion, which is in clear conflict with the government's own <span style="font-style:italic;text-transform:uppercase;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> strategic framework for access to justice in the federal civil justice system 2009</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I understand that both the government and the opposition have already indicated that they will not be supporting this disallowance motion, I look forward to hearing their justifications as to why this measure is necessary at all and the type of impact they expect the removal of the waiver will have on financially disadvantaged applicants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you are unable to access a review of your decision if you have the money to pay for it. What kind of Labor value is that? The Greens believe that in order to comply with the principle of natural justice for all visa applicants they must have the right to have their appeal heard, irrespective of their financial status. This is a core issue which goes right to the heart of where this govern­ment is at when it looks at the review of migration decisions. Why is it that, if you have enough money, you can have your appeal assessed, but if you do not have enough money, bad luck? Where is the justification from the government to cut and slash this financial assistance to disadvant­aged individuals, aside from their own budgeting issues and trying to keep more money in the coffers?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  The Migration Review Tribunal currently has a discretion to waive the $1,540 fee for a review of the decision if it is satisfied that the fee would cause the applicant severe financial hardship. That is a criterion and it seems to be a very fair criterion. It is not something which is done lightly but that discretion exists. Under these regulations, which I call 'mean and tricky regulations', which are the subject of this disallowance motion, the Migration Review Tribunal will only be able to reduce the review fee by 50 per cent. You have to ask: why? And where is the equity of this? It seems to me quite unreal that a person who is deemed to be suffering financial hardship and is unable to pay $1,540 is somehow supposed to be able to pay $770. If we are talking about people who are on the poverty line and are struggling, and for whom every cent counts, $770 is a very significant some of money. If they cannot pay $770 does that mean that the individual will have no access to a review? Furthermore, this fee well exceeds fees for other types of merits reviews of Commonwealth agency decisions. For instance, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal applies no fees if someone wants to appeal a Centrelink decision about entitle­ments, nor does the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of a Commonwealth workers compensation decision. It is $100 to appeal a visa cancellation on character grounds to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and just $77 to appeal a taxation objection decision of less than $5,000 to the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. So the $1,540 fee for a review of the MRT is exorbitant to begin with and to suggest that someone deemed to be in financial hardship is able to pay even half of that is beyond me. I support this disallowance motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AW5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  On behalf of the minister I indicate the government's position in regard to this disallowance motion. I would agree with Senator Hanson-Young and with the point that Senator Xenophon made that the work of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal is very important. What the evidence points to is that decisions are becoming more complex and are becoming more lengthy and that there are increasing numbers of occasions on which the tribunals are required to make decisions, therefore it is important that the necessary resources be provided to allow them to do their important work. So the government has agreed to changes to the application fees for these tribunals in terms of applications  to offset the appropriation for the operations of the tribunals in 2011-12 and in the out-years. Under these funding arrangements, the tribunals would have to incur operating losses in 2011-12 and in the forward years, making them technically insolvent, so the tribunals have insufficient cash reserves and the financial assets to meet their commitments as they fall due in the period of 2011-12.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fee amendments will fully offset an increase in appropriations to these tribunals and avoid operating losses over the forward estimates period consistent with the operating budget rules. So any disallowance of the fee amendments will have a very negative effect on the government's fiscal projections and, of course, any additional offsets required from the tribunals instead may adversely impact upon the way in which these tribunals are actually able to operate. These changes would enable the two tribunals to avoid operating losses over the forward estimates period and enhance the tribunals' capacity to respond to the significant increase in caseloads and the deterioration in the processing times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tribunals incurred operating losses of approximately $10 million between 2008-09 and 2010-11. The operating losses have been funded from accumulated appropriations and this is a position that is not sustainable. The revised funding for the tribunals increases the cost provisions per case taking into account increases in the operating costs such as the members' remuneration increases which have been determined by the Remuneration Tribunal itself. It recognises also increases in the complexity of cases due to the impact of court judgments on the conduct of reviews and the effort needed to resolve cases. The application lodgements for the MRT and the RRT increased by 23 per cent between 2007-08 and 2009-10. The MRT application fee of $1,400 has not increased since the MRT was established in 1999. The RRT application fee, which is only payable post decision if the applicant is found not to be a refugee, has been at $1,400 since 2003.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes for increases in the MRT and RRT application fees by 10 per cent from $1,400 to $1,540 will take effect from 1 July 2011. The application fee for the RRT only becomes payable after the review is completed and if the applicant is found not to be a refugee. The retaining of 50 per cent of the MRT application fee, rather than refunding the full application fee, is if the MRT sets aside the primary decision for applications for a review lodged on or before 1 July 2011. No fee is currently payable in relation to MRT applications by persons in immigration detention who are seeking a review of a decision to refuse or cancel a bridging visa, and no change is proposed to this. As to a reduction of a fee of 50 per cent on MRT applicants who are in financial hardship, rather than a full waiver for applications for review lodged on or after 1 July 2011, the $1,400 application fee to the MRT can be waived on the basis that the payment would cause severe financial hardship. There were fee waivers in some 490 cases, or six per cent of the applications lodged in the period of 2010-11, and 338 cases, or five per cent of the applications, in the year 2008-09. It should be noted that the fee will be refunded if the tribunal makes a favourable decision. So these provisions do preserve that arrangement. Automatic adjust­ment of the MRT and the RRT application fees for CPI increases would apply every two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of agreeing to this disallowance would be quite severe. The disallowance of the proposed fee structure would have a quite serious impact on the operations of the tribunals to the tune of about $3½ million, which is based on the proposition that there are some 8,300 cases currently being decided in the period of 2011-12. The disallowance of the partial fee waivers would have a negative impact of some $2.3 million per annum and that is based on the proposition that some 6,000 cases are being decided before the MRT in the period of 2011-12 and with, of course, the MRT only primary decisions setting aside at the rate of 49 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">   The disallowance of this regulation would result in both these tribunals having to internally reallocate funding from other parts of their budgets to provide for payment of the full refunds. These charges are about providing quality decision-making and to give these tribunals the resources they need to ensure that they maintain effective and efficient case resolutions. If this disallow­ance is agreed to by the Senate it would result in substantial delays in the time taken to review a decision, the impact of which would be felt most acutely by those who are in immigration detention, who, as a conse­quence of such an action, would remain in detention for much longer periods of time. The proposal that the Greens are advancing here would seriously disadvantage people who are currently in detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">   Many of the applications that are going to these tribunals are from parents and partners—and, of course, there are some children—who are waiting to join family members in Australia. Disallowing these changes in the fee structure may mean more time is spent separated from families. What the government is proposing is economically responsible and just, and it provides us with the appropriate mechanism to place support with those who are facing severe financial hardship. I seek the support of the Senate in rejecting this disallowance motion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very important bill. We have moved in the dissenting report to amend the bill to narrow down the description of discoveries, which should not be patentable. A lot of generous patents have been issued on inventive work that includes discovery work—that is, the discovery of genes. Nearly three years ago I rose to thank the Senate for its generosity in agreeing to an inquiry into the impact of gene patents on the provision of health care in Australia. The trigger for that inquiry was Myriad Genetics, the owner of Australian patents containing claims relating to genetic mutations in the BRCA 1 and 2 human genes linked to breast and ovarian cancers. Myriad has been granted not one but four patents giving it a monopoly over these genetic mutations in an isolated form. That is, they have been removed from the human genome. As well, Myriad had patent rights to any kind of BRCA 1 and 2 genetic testing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian patents were exclusively licensed to Genetic Technologies, which proceeded to send a 'cease and desist' letter to every laboratory in Australia providing BRCA genetic testing, threatening to sue them for patent infringement if they did not stop testing—and this included fine institutions such as Westmead Hospital in Sydney. But the public outrage, media attention and the Senate's action in agreeing to an inquiry—for which I am eternally grateful—forced Genetic Technologies to back off. The lawsuit never happened and laboratories got on with providing the much-needed BRCA test to Australian women.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument with Genetic Technologies, Myriad and IP Australia, which granted the patents in the first place, was not about the principle behind the Australian patent system that says that an invention should be rewarded with a patent. It was not about the incentives that are needed to encourage invention and innovation. It was not about compensating those undertaking risky and expensive research. It was about whether Myriad Genetics had actually invented anything in the first place. Common sense should tell us that a human gene and the human protein it codes for are natural phenomena. No-one invented the human genome. Certainly Myriad Genetics did not invent the genetic mutations that cause breast and ovarian cancer. That is what these Australian patents stand for. It is absurd in the 21st century, with everything that science knows about human genetics and the role that genes play in the production of proteins, that the materials that make us who we are and what we are can be monopolised and commoditised.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The patent system was never designed to grant patents for discoveries. That is what Myriad Genetics did: it patented certain genetic mutations in the BRCA 1 and 2 human genes which were linked to breast and ovarian cancer. The objective of the bill—which former Senator Coonan, Senator Xenophon, Senator Siewert and I sponsored in the Senate last November, which was introduced into the lower house by Peter Dutton, Rob Oakeshott and Malcolm Turnbull and which is the subject of the report tabled in the Senate today—is to make the distinction between discovery and invention clear when it comes to biological materials that are identical to those that exist in nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill had the support of not only the Cancer Council of Australia, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, the Human Genetics Society of Australasia, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Australian Medical Association, the Generic Medicines Industry Association, Cancer Voices Australia, Cancer Voices New South Wales, Cancer Voices South Australia, Cancer Voices Tasmania but also the federal Department of Health and Ageing. Each of these organisations made it clear that the current policy of allowing the patenting of biological materials that are naturally occurring and which no-one invented needs to be stopped. But it was not only these organisations that raised object­ions. In the United States, 20 plaintiffs sued Myriad Genetics to invalidate the patents which the US patent office had granted for the same genetic mutations. The US govern­ment, a co-owner of two of the four Australian patents, even went to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, agreeing with the plaintiffs. In its amicus brief to the court, the US government said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Genomic DNA itself, however, is a product of nature that is ineligible for patent protection, whether or not claimed in “isolated” form.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">acknowledge that this conclusion is contrary to the longstanding practice of the Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the practice of the National Institute of Health and other government agencies that have in the past sought and obtained patents for isolated genomic DNA. The district court’s judgment in this case, however, prompted the United States to reevaluate the relationship between such patents and the settled principle under Supreme Court precedent that the patent laws do not extend to products of nature. For the reasons below, the United States has concluded that isolated but otherwise unaltered genomic DNA is not patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that patent fight is nowhere near being over. In the meantime, the 20 plaintiffs who brought this action on behalf of the American people must wait for years before they have a definitive answer. It will not matter to Myriad Genetics, because by that time the BRCA patents will have expired.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Senate, with the help of our colleagues in the lower house, are in a unique position to get this right, now—once and for all. We know that those that have most to gain financially by keeping things as they are, the patent attorneys, the patent lawyers and the biological and pharma­ceutical industry, have been working hard to make sure this bill is ultimately defeated. It would seem, based on the majority report of the Senate today, that they have managed to convince some members of the Senate that a human gene is an invention. Let me assure the Senate that is a furphy. You do not have to take my word for it. Professor Sir John Sulston, a Nobel laureate and one of the leaders in the mapping of the human genome has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Promoters of gene patents argue that genes are patentable when they are "isolated and purified," or removed from the body and placed in a form so that they can be replicated outside the human body. This argument seems absurd to me. The essence of a gene is the information it provides—the sequence. Copying it into another format makes no difference. It is like taking a hardback book written by someone else, publishing it in paperback and then claiming authorship because the binding is different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Ian Frazer agrees with Professor Sulston. He has said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we allow patenting of genes we’re allowing patenting of ourselves. The patent system should protect inventive medicines developed from research using data on gene sequences. But a gene sequence used to develop the invention should not qualify the gene’s sequencer to receive benefits.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with Senators Siewert and Xenophon, we dissented from the majority report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. In our dissenting report we explain that the Australian patent system has lost its way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1989, Barry Jones, as Minister for Science and Technology, said during the second reading speech for the bill that became the Patents Act 1990 that one of the objectives was to strengthen Australia's patent law. Australia is now a soft entry point to the patent world. The bill was the result of a report prepared by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee, IPAC, which recommended the retention of the manner of manufacture test. One of the objectives of the bill was to restore the full scope of this test after two full Federal Court decisions removed the ability of the courts to strike down a patent on public policy grounds. Sixteen years after that report, the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee likewise agreed that the manner of manufacture test should be retained. More than that, the committee reinforced the importance of maintaining the distinction between discovery and invention. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the goals underpinning the National Competition Policy are well served by a patent policy that rigorously distinguishes between discoveries that advance our understanding of the nature, structure and properties of matter, and inventions that apply this understanding to useful products and processes. Within such a policy, only the latter should qualify for patent protection.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  Perhaps I could just recap the long debate on this bill thus far. I know the minister will be very helpful as we traverse these important issues. You will recall that earlier today my colleagues canvassed an issue in relation to the phrase 'welfare of students' in subsection (4) of section 19-38—that is, whether in fact money spent on the welfare of students could include a political cause. The reason this debate commenced more than 35 years ago, in the mid-seventies, was that student unions said they were acting on behalf of the welfare of students. You may recall that they used student money to fund all sorts of activities under the guise of the welfare of students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it was not just about the health of students. In those days it even involved direct political activity. I know that has been banned by this bill; I accept what the minister said earlier today. But, as far as I can tell, it does not stop the advocacy of a political cause under the rubric of 'welfare of students'. One example might be my rights at work. Another might be a campaign to stop the carbon tax. Again, that could be debated and money could be spent under the rubric of 'welfare of students'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This entire debate, since the mid-1970s, has caused so much tension. As my friend Senator Cormann said earlier today, as indeed did Senator Ronaldson, we have no objection to political causes being debated on campus—none at all. None of us in the opposition has any problems with that. What we object to strenuously is the money of students being used to advocate political causes that those students do not believe in. That is what we argue about. We will argue about it today, tomorrow, next week and forever, because we do not believe it is appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in the early 1980s, when I was at university, the problem I had was that my money was used by student unions to support the Palestine Liberation Organisation. That clearly is not a political party per se, but it is an organisation that even then, in my tender years, I could not support. I loathed the fact that student bodies at the Australian National University, where I was a student, were supporting the PLO. I objected to that so strongly then, and I still do now. Indeed, it was one of the major reasons I joined the Liberal club on campus. It made me into the fearsome right winger I am today. If it had not been for people spending my money supporting the PLO, who knows what would have happened? And I would not be wearing a pink shirt today!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I objected strongly, and that is a matter of principle. In fact, for all coalition senators who have spoken on this bill it is a matter of principle. Sure, the $250 is difficult for some students; that is true. But it is about more than just the money. Senator Ryan spoke about this eloquently, as always. It is a matter of principle and freedom of asso­ciation. We on this side simply do not believe our money should be spent on political causes we do not believe in. The PLO was the one I objected to so strongly 30 years ago. So my question to the minister is very clear. Is it possible that, under the rubric of welfare of students, a political cause could be promoted by student bodies? That is a question I would like a direct answer to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is just one short, personal story amidst the many I have heard or read on the issue of marriage equality. The issue of marriage equality has evoked considerable debate around Australia. Marriage equality is always at the forefront of media commentary and has been a hot issue in both formal and informal debate in my home state of Tasmania. Even before the motion passed the federal House of Representatives on 18 November 2010 asking politicians to gauge their local community's views on same-sex marriage, I had been contacted by a number of Tasmanians and Australians keen to have their views heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I personally believe that an amendment to the Marriage Act will ensure that Australia remains a country which promotes equality, fairness and dignity for all citizens, I also wanted to give Tasmanians the opportunity to put forward their personal view on marriage equality. In addition to learning the views of constituents who phoned my office, wrote to me or met with me, I launched an online survey on my website on 27 April 2011. It had three parts. Question 1 asked: Do you believe that the federal government should legislate to deliver greater relationship recognition to same-sex couples? Question 2 then asked respondents to indicate whether they supported one or more of the following options: amending the Marriage Act so that same-sex couples can be married; a national civil unions scheme which is open to both same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples; a national civil unions scheme which is open to same-sex couples only. Question 3 gave respondents the opportunity to share their personal story or leave a comment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I closed the online survey at 5 pm on Friday, 9 September. After scrutinising the survey data, I was able to remove responses from constituents who lived outside of Tasmania and others whose details were not able to be verified against the electoral roll. In total I can report that 509 constituents from across Tasmania completed the survey. I can also report that, in addition to the survey responses, I have had 584 other interactions with Tasmanian constituents on the issue of marriage equality, and the emails, letters and phone calls are still coming in every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Combining the survey responses and the constituent interactions, I had had 1,093 interactions on the issue of marriage equality as at 9 September. An analysis of those 1,093 interactions indicates that, state wide, 55.9 per cent of Tasmanians support marriage equality. Looking specifically at the data collated from the electorate of Denison, which is the electorate in which I live and in which my office is based, 167 of the constituents who contacted my office were from the electorate of Denison and 184 of the Tasmanian respondents to the survey were constituents living in the electorate of Denison. Out of those total 351 interactions, I can conclude that 78.6 per cent of Denison constituents support marriage equality. Given the sample size of my data, I believe this represents a statistically sound indication of the views held by the Denison electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Denison, out of the 184 respondents to the survey, 83.1 per cent said that they supported amending the Marriage Act so that same-sex couples can be married. Of that 83.1 per cent, 33.1 per cent said they would also support a civil unions scheme open to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples, 3.8 per cent said they supported a civil unions scheme open to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples, 1.08 per cent said they support­ed a civil unions scheme open to same-sex couples only and 11.9 per cent were against any legally recognised relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 167 constituents who contacted my office through emails, letters or phone calls, 73.65 per cent supported amending the Marriage Act to allow for same-sex marriage, which, as I mentioned earlier, means that, when both the survey responses and contacts are calculated, I can report that 78.6 per cent of Denison constituents contacting my office support marriage equality. The data I have collected therefore suggests that the electors of Denison strongly support marriage equality and have a clear preference for amending the Marriage Act. The data also indicates that a number of people were happy to support both a civil unions scheme and an amendment to the Marriage Act, but a large proportion of respondents indicate marriage equality is the preferred way forward—a clear preference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the data I have collected from the electorate of Denison, a socially progressive electorate, shows there is strong support for marriage equality, this support is not limited to Denison. The support for marriage equality is widespread. A recently released poll, conducted in February this year by Enterprise Marketing and Research Services, EMRS, shows that 59 per cent of Tasman­ians surveyed believe same-sex couples should be allowed to legally marry. More support for marriage equality can be found in Newspoll figures from November 2010 which show that 65 per cent of Australians 'have no problem' with allowing same-sex marriage and in Nielsen polls from November 2010 and March 2011 which show 57 per cent of people support marriage equality nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst there have been a number of national polls on the issue, many parliamentarians have been reporting back on the results from their own community consultations. Throughout the reporting period, it has become apparent that there are very strongly held views on both sides of the marriage equality debate. It is worth highlighting that results I have collected supporting marriage equality come not just from friends and family of the gay and lesbian community but from throughout the Denison electorate and more broadly across Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The data I am presenting today is a reflection of the constituent views which I received as part of my consultation period with the community. I note that, just today, the Tasmanian state parliament passed a motion supporting marriage equality and calling on the Commonwealth parliament to amend the Marriage Act to provide for marriage equality. I welcome the passage of this motion by the Tasmanian state parlia­ment and congratulate the Premier of Tasma­nia, the Hon. Lara Giddings MP, for provid­ing leadership on this issue. I look forward to the debate on this issue at the Labor Party's national conference in December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we continue to debate the issue of marriage equality and pursue the end of legislated discrimination against same-sex couples, it is also important to recognise Labor's record on reform. We have a proud history of achievement in bringing equality and recognition for same-sex couples in Australia. In our first term of government, federal Labor successfully amended up to 85 pieces of legislation to remove discrimina­tion against same-sex couples. These reforms removed discrimination and equalised treatment for same-sex couples in the areas of taxation, social security, health, aged care, superannuation, immigration, child support and family law. In my home state of Tasmania, the Labor Party has also led the way in law reform for the recognition of same-sex relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across Australia, other states have legislated to recognise same-sex de facto couples, to ensure same-sex couples receive fair access to assisted reproductive techno­logy such as IVF and to enable same-sex couples to adopt children. It follows that same-sex couples ought to have the right to define their relationship and should not be restricted in the way in which they celebrate their love for each other. Without amending the Marriage Act, we will perpetuate discrimination and inequality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Labor Party state conferences held this year, with the exception of NSW, who deferred their decision to the ALP national conference, have passed motions in support of marriage equality. In my home state of Tasmania, the state conference support for marriage equality significantly boosts our campaign to change the national platform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Historically there have been many debates about marriage. There was a time when interracial couples were not allowed to marry, and there was also a time when a wife was 'property' of her husband. This is not the case anymore. That is why we need to legislate to represent the values of Australia today. The institution of marriage has evolved to reflect changing social attitudes in the past. Given the majority of Australians today are saying that they support marriage equality, it is incumbent upon us in the parliament to take this final step towards full equality and recognition for all Australians. We have the power to amend the Marriage Act to allow for marriage to be between two people who love each other and who want to make that commitment public and official. Amending the Marriage Act will remove this one last barrier to full legal equality for same-sex partners and protect Australia's reputation as a proud, multicultural, multifaith, vibrant and diverse country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Same-sex couples can marry in Canada, Spain, South Africa, Portugal, Mexico, Argentina, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and the US states of Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and the District of Columbia. I want to see Australia added to that list.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6V" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  During this adjournment debate tonight I would like to talk about an issue that has been dividing Queensland's north-west. I recently visited Queensland's north-west, one of this country's most beautiful, vast and resource-rich areas. On the journey I visited communities in Mount Isa, Boulia and Cloncurry. I met people who loved their place, who were full of reasons why they live where they live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are issues with living up there. Up there, people pay 40 per cent more for goods, and that will rise even further with Labor's carbon tax. Some high schools in Mount Isa offer only two OP subjects. Aged-care options are minimal. There is a saying in Mount Isa: 'Get old, go to the coast.' Housing is substandard and in short supply. Mount Isa desperately needs to find $8½ million for badly needed sewerage works for the town itself. Power is even at times rationed. The lone nurse in Cloncurry is expected by her employer to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, although the community recognises that this is an intolerable burden for any one person to shoulder. There is all this when the mining areas around Mount Isa hold 25 per cent of the world's mineral wealth. Yes, that is right—25 per cent of the world's mineral wealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are some even more shameful figures that are growing worse every day as the trucks and trains with their loads of wealth head south and east, and that is in the rate of Indigenous suicide in the Mount Isa area. So far this year, 23 people have taken their lives in Mount Isa. Twenty of those who felt so bad that they chose oblivion over their country were Indigenous—20 out of 23. A social worker I met on my recent journey north went to the funeral of a co-worker last week. Her name was Yulilla Johnson. In the language of her people, the Goreng Goreng mob, Yulilla means butterfly. She was very attractive. She was beautiful. She was young. She was 19. Two more young Aboriginal women with children also took their lives that week. Indigenous Australians suffer a burden of disease that is 2½ times greater than in the general Australian population. For Indigenous women, depression and anxiety are the leading causes of their health burden. Those figures were reported in 2008 by the Institute of Health and Welfare. What is going on in Mount Isa right now, today, this very minute, suggests something even worse, with 23 deaths already this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to tell you another story about another young Indigenous women in Mount Isa who took her life last week. I will just try to paint a picture of what it was like for her. She was married to a man who long ago had given up through depression and drank almost nonstop. All of her birth family and all of his were regularly crammed into a small, shabby house. It was an environment of constant noise, arguments, fights and destruction. She was bashed regularly. She could not remember when she had last bought some little luxury for herself. She could not even afford a woman's everyday needs. She often had no money to put food on the table. Officers from the Queensland Child Safety Services were regularly at the door accusing her of neglect but offering no solution. The Department of Education and Training wanted to know why her kids were not at school but offered no support. Queensland Housing and Homelessness Services wanted to know why she was behind with the rent but offered no solution. Once all those people had left her door, the police turned up because her eldest boy had started breaking windows and vandalising property. Then her electricity was cut off and the gas company came and took the gas bottles away. So one morning last week she walked into the backyard, grabbed the garden hose and hanged herself from the mango tree. She was also 19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the most recent data, the rate of Indigenous suicide in Mount Isa in the age range of zero to 34 is 887 per 100,000. The national rate for Indigenous suicide in the zero to 34 range is 39 per 100,000. So you have 887 per 100,000 in Mount Isa and 39 per 100,000 in the rest of the Indigenous community under 34. That means that in Mount Isa Indigenous suicide is 22.74 times higher than the suicide rate in the national Indigenous population and 79.59, just on 80, times higher that an in the national non-Indigenous population. I would hope that anybody would think that those sorts of statistics suggest that what we have here is an epidemic. This situation has been known to the Queensland Bligh government for some time. People like my social worker friend and others have been begging the Queensland government for some time to do anything about it. You usually would hope that with an epidemic you get strong, decisive action. But what has the Queensland government done about it? The Queensland health minister in February gave $200,000 to the local Queensland Health regional manag­er to employ an external expert to 'get on top of the problem'. With 75,000 employees in the state department of health, you would wonder why they needed to hire someone from outside. But, even worse, seven months and 16 deaths later, since February, Queens­land has still not employed someone who is supposed to address this situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This situation is not going to be fixed by a few dollars. It will be fixed by professional diligence, genuine effort and genuine care and long, slow, careful community building. The preponderance of young Indigenous people who view suicide as a viable solution to personal problems must be fixed. The silence surrounding the issue may protect those who have the responsibility for the health of our community, but that silence is not helping Mount Isa at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many in Mount Isa who claim—and I suspect perhaps with a certain element of truth—that the clamour about this in George Street and in Canberra would be deafening if it were white fellas who were suiciding. If there had been 23 suicides in Mount Isa of whites, it would not be something that I would need to raise during the adjournment debate; it would be front-page news all over the country. So keeping quiet about the numbers is not helping and treating the symptoms is ineffective. The causative factors for these suicides are drug and alcohol abuse, relationship breakdown, poor mental health, unemployment, low vocational education skills, loss of identity and inadequate communications skills. How many young Indigenous men and women need to die before the real issues are addressed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased today to have the oppor­tunity to speak to the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors, representing a very large proportion of the Queensland community, and raise with them the idea that it is time that local government got involved in the mental health of their communities. We saw so vividly in Queensland during the floods and cyclones that it is not the government health department that can provide the genuine underlying strength. Certainly they can provide the funds and they can look as though they care—that is always a good start. But it is in your local community that you can build the capacity and build the structures so that people feel as though there is a genuine alternative to simply walking out into the backyard and hanging yourself on a mango tree with a garden hose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to hear that the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, told the House of Representatives today that he is going to Mount Isa next week. But this issue needs more than just a fly-by. It needs genuine, considered, caring action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="192970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I wish to speak about matters related to the Great Barrier Reef, which is a beautiful part of my town in Queensland. I would urge everyone to go and visit, because it is lovely, but unfortunately it is under threat from a number of things, some which I want to talk at length about this evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure senators would be aware that about two months ago UNESCO, the body responsible for looking after our World Heritage areas and making sure that state signatories to that convention are abiding by their obligations, gave the Australian govern­ment a pretty big rap over the wrist in how the government has dealt with the Gladstone Harbour LNG export facilities. This is yet another example of why the coal seam gas industry is steaming far too fast ahead without proper consideration of not only farmers' rights but also the environmental damage that it promises to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The specific point about this is the 55 million tonnes of dredging of the Gladstone Harbour seabed to facilitate the deepening of that harbour and hence the export of LNG. Unfortunately, the Australian government neglected to inform, as it is obliged to, the World Heritage Committee about its inten­tion to authorise any new development that may affect the outstanding universal value of the property. This is a major issue of concern because this is the world body saying that the Australian government is potentially presiding over and approving activities that could threaten the World Heritage status of the Great Barrier Reef—surely the most iconic and wondrous place that we as Australians and, I would argue, people globally, think is so significant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter that I want to speak about this evening is in that context. It is the combination of both coal export facility expansions and a whole lot of toxic industries that are planned for Bowen, which is further up the Queensland coast in a beautiful part of Queensland and the world. At the moment there is a 16½ thousand hectare state development area that the Queensland government proposes to approve to house some of the world's most polluting industries—namely aluminium and nickel refineries with smelters, chloralkali plants, ammonium nitrate plants, coke and gas fired power plants—and, of course, to expand the port facility to turn it into a multicargo facility that will allow export not just of the 25 megatonnes per annum of coal per year but of 230 megatonnes per annum if the Palmer and Hancock coalmines are approved in the Galilee Basin, which certainly from all records of both state and federal govern­ments they look to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a huge concern because this export facility is situated right next to an absolutely beautiful wetland area which meets Ramsar criteria—it is not yet listed, although it certainly deserves to be—and houses over 20,000 migratory birds. Clearly this is a really important area that sits adjacent to another really important area, the Great Barrier Reef. So we have got two huge repositories of biodiversity that deserve protection and, unfortunately, our state government for one is proposing to trash it. This brings me to the role of the federal government, which has received quite a number of referrals under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the EPBC Act, which deals with this area. So not only is there the multicargo facility expansion, which would entail 580 hectares of dredging and reclamation in the World Heritage area—it beggars belief, but there are the facts—including 22 square kilometres of the World Heritage area actually being lost, but there is a litany of other projects. There is further dredging associated with the expansion and there are various infrastructure components and investigations related to that expansion. There is the proposed Chalco alumina refinery, which is currently on hold but still on the federal government's assessment books. There is the proposed Waratah coal terminal and the proposed Hancock coal terminal. Another south Galilee coal project is proposed. Also proposed are the massive Adani Mining coalmine and rail project, and the 'Water for Bowen' project. This region is being slammed and the federal government is still failing to look at these projects cumulatively. It is assessing each and every one of these referrals individually.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That makes absolutely no sense at all. There is no scientific justification for that. It is really incumbent upon the federal govern­ment to now say, 'We need to take a strategic assessment approach to this and start looking at things in context and consider whether or not the reclamation and loss of 22 square kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area is really the sort of legacy that we want to leave for our kids.' I would hope not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing I am particularly interested in, as we saw the failure of the Australian government to let UNESCO know about this massive Gladstone port expansion, is whether they have told UNESCO about the proposed Bowen expansions. Are they keeping the world bodies informed, as they are required to under the operational guide­lines that I referred to earlier? I wonder, because I suspect UNESCO would not be terribly happy with Australia in that respect. So, when UNESCO visits Australia on their monitoring mission early next year, I will certainly be raising with them the need to expand their terms of reference to include looking not just at Gladstone but at the Bowen part of the Queensland coast. No doubt they could look at a whole lot of other things while they are also here, but that is another story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on record the amazing work that the local community groups have been doing around the proliferation of develop­ment proposals. There is so much to keep up with and these folk are all volunteers. I want to single out for mention Ian Lee, who is a particularly committed activist in Bowen; Maria MacDonald, also from Bowen; and Patricia Julien, from the Mackay Conser­vation Group. They are really the last bastions of the defenders of this wilderness. They are up against it, when it comes to the proliferation of stupid and damaging proposals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be pursuing with the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Popu­lation and Communities whether or not he has made those referrals to UNESCO, as he is obliged to do. I will be seeking from him a commitment to assess this litany of proposals through a strategic assessment process rather than on a one-on-one basis, which will see death by a thousand cuts. I will be raising with him the need to protect the Caley Valley wetland, given that it is such a beautiful haven for migratory birds and does meet the Ramsar criteria. In time we would hope to see that, in this age of climate change, rather than expanding our coal export facilities by a magnitude which is endangering the Great Barrier Reef not only directly through shipping but naturally through climate change and ocean acidifi­cation that we might actually see a reduction in coal exports. Why are we planning to double coal exports in my home state of Queensland, when the science is telling us that if we are serious about inhabiting this planet and passing it on to future generations then we need to turn around our emissions profile in the next five years?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with great shame that we are placing the Great Barrier Reef under such threat from these specific proposals and from the mentality of 'Let's just keep pushing it to its limits and it'll bounce back.' Unfortunately, it will not bounce back and that is why UNESCO is coming here: to look at whether in fact the government is approving projects that threaten the Great Barrier Reef's outstanding universal value. It would be an incredible embarrassment if this generation, this parliament, presided over any endanger­ment of the listing of the Great Barrier Reef as one of our most beautiful and precious World Heritage icons. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to being able to advocate for the Great Barrier Reef in this place in the years to come and I look forward to a more sustainable approach from both sides of the chamber when it comes to looking after our precious few World Heritage areas. They are great tourism icons. If nothing else, if you cannot accept the inherent value of these places, then look at the economics of it: 67,000 people are employed on the reef, providing a $6 billion annual income to this nation's books. These are important areas and we must do our utmost to protect them. I will be pursuing these matters with the minister. I would ask both sides of the chamber to really think about whether this is an appropriate sort of future for our beautiful Great Barrier Reef and to visit it while it is still there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0O" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  When I assumed my current position as Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, one of the things I was looking forward to was the opportunity to debate defence issues with the shadow defence minister, Senator Johnston. But I have been sadly disappointed. Not only is Senator Johnston a shadow but he seems to be a silent shadow. For a senior shadow minister, he has had very little to say about defence matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, he has spoken only four or five times on defence matters, not counting condolence motions. To the best of my recollection, in this calendar year he has not asked a single question without notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. So I was delighted this week to see Senator Johnston making a major statement on defence policy. I was of course surprised that he chose not to do this by way of making a statement in the Senate, which I would have thought was the correct thing to do. He did not even issue a general media release. Instead, he announced his new policy through an exclusive interview with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. I suppose that should not have surprised me. The opposition seem to have outsourced most of their policy work to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, since they are happy to just get up in the morning and, indeed, every day in the Senate and read out whatever the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> has said that morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, I have to give Senator Johnston credit for his courage in announ­cing his policy statement and, as it turned out, his politically suicidal courage. I say that because Senator Johnston has put forward a sweeping revision of defence policy, a revision not only of this government's policy but also of the broad consensus that has existed between the major parties on defence policy since, at least, 1984.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The core of Senator Johnston's new policy is massive cuts to the defence procurement program, outlined in the 2009 Defence white paper. In fact, Senator Johnston wants to scrap that white paper entirely and write a new one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The two biggest cuts Senator Johnston wants to make are to halve the number of F35 Joint Strike Fighters we buy and to scrap the plans for 12 new Australian made submarines under the Future Submarine Program. Apparently, he thinks he can save $30 billion to $40 billion by scrapping these two programs. Why is Senator Johnston proposing to gut our defence procurement program in such a radical way? The answer is obvious: the coalition is committed to cutting government spending by something in the order of $70 billion. Slashing our defence procurement is Senator Johnston's contribution to achieving that objective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators opposite do not like being reminded about the $70 billion black hole they are committed to creating in our budget. Let me remind them what they have been committed to. The shadow treasurer, Mr Hockey, said on 16 August: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Finding $60, $70 billion is about identifying waste, identifying areas where you don't need to proceed with programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently our nation's defence is an example of waste, and defence procurement is of one of these pesky programs we do not need. The shadow finance minister, Mr Robb, was specifically asked, on <span style="font-style:italic;">Meet the Press</span> on 4 September, about whether defence is to be included in this massive cutting of government programs. He said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are looking at $70 billion as a sort of out-marker … We are looking at every area, there's not one area of any portfolio that is protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me repeat: 'not one area of any portfolio'. I think that is a line that may come back to haunt the opposition. So we know where Senator Johnston got the idea that he was expected to cut defence procurement by tens of billions. He got it from Mr Hockey and Mr Robb. We might have assumed that he also got it from Mr Abbott, but we learn today that Mr Abbott does not want to accept the logic of Senator Johnston's policy, and is hanging the senator out to dry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come back to that fascinating question in a minute. But first let us ask the serious question: what would be the effect of scrapping our commitments to buy the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and to build new submarines for our Navy? It would be to create a massive capability gap for both our Navy and Air Force. It would grievously affect the ability of the Defence Force to carry out the tasks Australia will expect of it over the coming decades. It would also deal a death blow to our defence manufacturing capability. Australia has been intimately involved in the JSF project since its inception—one of the Howard government's better decisions, and one which has always enjoyed bipartisan support. The plane is tailor-made to meet our defence aviation needs for the next 30 years. The JSF is expensive, to be sure, but when the cost is considered over the expected lifetime of the planes, it is not excessive. Senator Johnston himself has acknowledged how important submarine capability is to our defence needs, as an island nation with vulnerable trade routes and offshore assets, in a region in which the naval power of other regional players is growing and expanding. The future submarine program, like the JSF, is expensive, but also like the JSF it will be a long-term asset that will prove its worth over coming decades. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Johnston does not deny that cutting the JSF procurement and scrapping the future submarine program would harm our defence capability. So he has proposed a couple of patch-up solutions. He intends to expand the existing F/A-18 Super Hornets, in the hope that they will do the job that the JSF is being bought to do. And he would buy cheaper off-the-shelf submarines from some­where in Europe, despite the fact, which he has acknowledged himself, that they would not meet our very specific operational needs. He would give our Air Force inferior planes, and our Navy inferior submarines—a sub­marine fleet designed to patrol the Baltic rather than Australia's sea and air approaches. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Near enough is apparently good enough for Senator Johnston. Well, it's not good enough for this government. We have a serious commitment to giving Australia the best possible defence capability. Given our location and our strategic environment, and the best projections of our future strategic environment, that means serious investment in air and naval assets. Senator Johnston is not a stupid person, and I expect he reads the same reports on these questions that I have read. He knows what I have said is true. He knows why we are committing these large sums to these important procurement projects. He also knows that winning public support for defence spending requires bipartisan commitment. Yet he is being driven into this reckless folly by the ideological fetishes of his party and the short-term tactical manoeuvring of his leader. He is being driven into a policy which is dangerous, which is irresponsible, and which he knows he will have to reverse if he ever finds himself as defence minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would think, however, that Senator Johnston's chances of becoming defence minister have been considerably reduced by the reception that his announcement in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> has received from his own party colleagues. Did it not occur to Senator Johnston that his decision to scrap the future submarine program might be received with something less than ecstasy by his South Australian colleagues? Did he not know that the submarines are most likely to be built in Adelaide, which, under the strong leadership of Premier Mike Rann, has become a defence manufacturing hub? Apparently not, and apparently also Senator Johnston forgot to warn the honourable member for Sturt, Mr Chris Pyne, of his plans. Mr Pyne rushed to repudiate Senator Johnston's announcement. He told ABC Radio in Adelaide this morning: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm making it perfectly clear this morning to you that there is no intention on the coalition's part to reduce our defence capabilities, no intention to reduce the defence budget and South Australia is the pre-eminent place to build and maintain defence infrastructure whether it's through Saab systems or BAE or the Australian Submarine Corporation, we'll continue our history of being the defence hub for this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Pyne also said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, there's a very good reason to maintain a capability to build ships and defence infrastructure for Australia's national interest and for our manufacturing sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't often agree with Mr Pyne but that is an absolutely correct statement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pretty hard to top Mr Pyne's comments as a public slap in the face for Senator Johnston. But Senator Johnston's leader, Mr Abbott, has also rushed to repudiate him. He told Chris Uhlmann: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The coalition will never make savings at the expense of the operational capabilities of our Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since it would of course be impossible to cut the JSF program in half or to scrap the future submarine program without affecting the operational capabilities of our Defence Force, it seems that Mr Abbott has overruled Senator Johnston on both these questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time Senator Johnston has floated a thought bubble on an important defence matter only to have it shot down almost at once. Last October he sought to lecture the Army on how they ought to be fighting the war in Afghanistan, telling them that they should be deploying our Abrams tanks there. The then CDF, Air Chief Marshal Houston, had to gently remind Senator Johnston that most of Afghanistan is mountains, and neither the terrain nor our operations were suitable for the deployment of heavy armour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole episode is typical of the tactics of the opposition. They tell us that they must cut the budget by $70 billion, but they won't say how or where they will do it, and they deny any specific cut when they are asked about it. One minute they tell us that 'there's not one area of any portfolio that is protected', and the next minute they tell us that 'the coalition will never make savings at the expense of the operational capabilities of our Defence Force'. They cannot all be right. Their policy is a swamp of confusion and contradiction. By flagging specific cuts, Senator Johnston has broken the rules of the opposition's game, and that is why his colleagues have been so quick to hang him out to dry. Better luck next time, Senator.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Chris Evans:</span>
                  </a>  The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) In general terms, when considering the contribution of Reserves or contractors to “combat capability” Defence will seek to maximise the strengths and capabilities of each particular element in order to meet the demands of operational force generation, sustainment and rotation requirements.  Reserves and contractors will be utilised where most appropriate to ensure our combat capability meets national security requirements.  Therefore, the immediate cost of combat capability is not necessarily reduced through the use of Reserves or Contractors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) There have been no 'one off' savings in relation to the use of reserves on operations for the period 1 January to 30 June 2011. In general terms a Reservist will cost more than a full-time soldier for the period of the deployment because a proportion of Reservists will have employers who are eligible for Employer Support Payments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For contracted service support, an assessment of a one-off saving can be made based on the following example of contracted aircraft support to Operation ASTUTE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A C130 is significantly more expensive to operate than a commercial aircraft, and consequently the ADF is using contracted service support to reduce costs for airlift in support of Operation ASTUTE (East Timor). A C130 costs approximately $15,000 - $21,000 per hour (direct cost) to operate (depending on the C130 variant) and at any given time, the C130 fleet is heavily utilised within the ADF, with its air hour allocation apportioned across operations, exercises, training and contingency tasking. It takes approximately 17 hours flying time for a return task to Darwin, which includes positioning of the aircraft from RAAF Richmond to Darwin and return. The total cost of this exercise would be approximately $255,000- $357,000 per movement. Conversely, the cost of the current De Havilland Dash 8 contracted aircraft to conduct this task is approximately $29,000 per movement (Darwin to Dili and return). In this circumstance, and while the security situation in Dili allows, it is more cost effective to contract commercial airlift for this aspect of support for Operation ASTUTE.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) (a) (b) Navy allocates training days to individual Funded Reserve Commitment (FRC) and Short Term Reserve Project (STRP) positions that are linked to Navy capability requirements. These positions are allocated to establishments, units and departments across Navy and non-Navy components. These days can be used anytime during the training (financial) year, and are not allocated on a half yearly basis. While just under $25m was allocated for Reserve salaries for Financial Year 2010/11, just under $20m was expended in the first half. The unused funds were re-allocated for use in the second half of the financial year, which coincided with a review of the allocation across Navy and non-Navy components. The subsequent re-allocation included changes to the rank levels of Navy Reserve personnel employed, with mainly higher ranks to be employed in the second half of the financial year, meaning that while spending would be maintained, the number of actual days used would reduce. A total of 93,169 training days were allocated used across Navy for the entire Financial Year  2010/11 as follows:</span>
