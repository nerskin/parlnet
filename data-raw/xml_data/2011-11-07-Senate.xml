                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  The committee stage of the clean energy bills is designed to ensure that we get answers to specific questions. I seek to raise with the minister this morning whether the govern­ment still claims that the carbon tax is needed to save the planet. If so, why has it ignored constant warnings, especially from the opposition, that the carbon tax in Australia, acting alone, would in fact have the perverse result of increasing the world's carbon dioxide emissions? As yet another specific example, I refer to Coogee Chemicals, which will now shelve its methanol plant proposed for Australia. Instead of being built in Australia, it will now be built in China, with four times the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. Not only does the world suffer four times the carbon dioxide emissions; Australia loses 150 jobs, a $1 billion investment and $14 billion in export earnings. Indeed, the existing methanol plant, in Ms Gillard's very own electorate, has had its future questioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask in relation to all that: was this part of the Treasury modelling? In that context, I also ask the minister to explain—because it was not answered last week—why it is that Australian coal dug up for Australian energy production, for Australian jobs and Australian manufacturing, is seen as being so evil that it requires a carbon tax, but Australian coal dug up for energy production in China, for Chinese jobs and Chinese manufacturing, is okay and will not have a carbon tax imposed on it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, another issue that the minister did not answer last week: on what authority does the government claim that it can force this legislation through the parliament? Was it an election promise? Does the government claim to have another electoral mandate? Does it claim to have popular support as witnessed by opinion polls? On what basis does the government actually believe that it can guillotine these measures through this place, or is it simply that the government is doing the bidding of the Australian Greens?</span>

Here we are in the committee stage. We have one amendment from the opposition. They have yet to move it. All they are doing is making the same political points over and over again that they have made for years.</span>

                    </a>  They say they are asking questions. They are not interested in the answers. They are in large part the same questions they have asked for the last year. Really it comes down to this: the opposition just want to say no. They just want to vote no. It is all a complete pretence from them that they have any interest whatsoever in the detail of this legislation. They do not. They do not have any interest in the policy, as is evinced by the fact that they are putting forward a policy that seeks the same environmental outcome at a higher cost to Australian business and to Australian taxpayers. Let us pause there and remember: this opposition want the same reduction in emissions from Australia that the government has pledged, but the opposition want Australian business and Australian families to pay more to achieve that reduction. The position of the opposition only has to be said to be demonstrated to be utterly ridiculous.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very happy to answer some of the questions which have been put, but I will again say—and I will make this point in every contribution: move your amendment; have the debate on the amendment; vote on the amendment. Senator Xenophon has some amendments. They should be moved and debated. What we saw from the opposition in the last four hours on Thursday—and what I predict we will continue to see—notwithstanding all the complaints about the shortness of time, was more of the same, more of what we saw in the 63 hours of debate on the CPRS, what we have seen in the last year, what we have seen in question time, what we have seen in the some 30-odd inquiries on climate change and in particular the many which have occurred in the last parliament and this parliament: the same series of questions that they have no interest in the answers to, because they do not believe that climate change is real. Certainly Senator Abetz does not, and he does not believe that we should do anything about it. Bizarrely he seems to want us to tax Australians more to try and pretend to do something about it, but that is the economics that seems to be running the opposition at the moment. I was asked about Coogee Chemicals' proposed investment. I refer the senator to the statement put out by Minister Combet today, which made a number of points. The first is that, because we are committed to proper support of Australian industry as we transition from a very high-polluting economy to a clean energy economy, which is a very large economic transition—we agree with that; we have been saying that for many years—we have a $9.2 billion Jobs and Competitiveness package, which is designed to address the issue of competitiveness to which the senator referred in his question. For industries that are highly emissions intensive, which would include, I am advised, activities like methanol product­ion, the assistance to be provided starts at 94.5 per cent. Let us just pause for a moment and understand what that means. That means that 94.5 per cent of their carbon liability under the package would be dealt with by the issue of free permits. Remember also that those free permits are against an average efficiency baseline—in other words, to look at the efficiency of the particular process as it exists. That in builds an incentive for people to be more efficient, because if you are actually more efficient than the average you can retain free permits over and above that. Mr Combet has told us:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fact is that a highly<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Cambria Math;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‐</span>efficient methanol producer like Coogee Chemicals is likely to end up with no net carbon price liability under our industry assistance arrangements, so they will not be at any disadvantage compared to their international competitors.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear. That is the advice that the minister has provided the chamber and I, as the minister representing him, provide the chamber with to put a little bit of clarity in the scare campaign that the opposition are engaging in.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also make the point that it is not the case on the government's policy that assistance under this package is simply withdrawn after five years. There is a review process during which regard will also be had to the state of international action in the relevant industry sector. So that deals with that issue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We go on and on about the Treasury modelling. Really there is one point that the opposition cannot get away from. They cannot get away from the fact that the Treasury modelling, the people who advised Peter Costello, have made it very clear in public modelling that we can grow our economy, that we can grow jobs, that we can grow income and that we can reduce emissions from what they would otherwise be with a carbon price. It does not matter how many times the government says that, the opposition simply do not want to accept it, so they ask the same set of questions over and over again. They simply cannot deal with the fact that those are the findings of that modelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked about Australian coal. I covered that in great detail on Thursday with I think Senator Macdonald. We talked about the coal package that the government has in place. We talked about the fact that what we were looking at was a small number of very gassy underground mines and, therefore, the government has in place an assistance package and a coal abatement technology package as well that are designed to recognise those matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also went through on Thursday with the senator—and I appreciate that Senator Abetz was not in the chamber and may not have had an opportunity to hear it, or maybe he did not wish to—the increase in investments in resources, including in coal, over the last three years. When we talk about the effect on the economy—and in the face of what is really quite a shameless fear campaign from those opposite—I invite senators to look at the actual investment numbers. It is sort of a question of: which proposition do those facts support? Which proposition does the money support? The investment demonstrates that the market recognises that they can continue to make money with a carbon price. So, despite Senator Abetz, Mr Abbott and others saying that the sky is going to fall in, the reality is that we see continued growth in investment in resources, including in coal, which really puts paid to the sorts of propositions that the opposition are putting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also asked about the procedural arrangements. We have had years of debate on this issue. We had some 60 hours of debate on the CPRS. We have had numerous Senate inquiries. I have been asked questions over and over again by the opposition. The reality is that no amount of debate will change the minds of Senator Abetz or Senator Bernardi. They are vehemently opposed to a carbon price. The Labor Party have been trying to get a carbon price through this Senate for some years now. We were not able in the previous parliament and we look forward to the Senate finally taking the responsible step that it ought to have taken, finally doing what is right, and passing this legislation. I invite the opposition and Senator Xenophon to do the normal process in committees and move their amendments and speak to them.</span>

Why is it good for the world environment that Coogee Chemicals goes to China on the back of the govern­ment's policies, where they will be emitting four times the amount of carbon dioxide than they would have been in Australia under the current laws? In the very long speech by the minister none of those issues were actually answered or addressed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister referred in her answer to actual numbers. They are the actual numbers that I have given her—a $1 billion project, 150 jobs and $14 billion worth of potential export earnings being lost to our nation with the perverse result of four times the carbon dioxide emissions into the world's atmos­phere. They are actual numbers. That is what is on the table. All that is going to occur because of the government's carbon tax.</span>

If we are to believe the minister in relation to all the discussions that have been had over the years about the need for a carbon tax, can she explain why she herself, her leader, her deputy leader and every single Labor candidate at the last election went to that election promising there would be no carbon tax. The minister has not answered any of those questions. I will sit down again now to give the minister the opportunity to actually provide detailed responses to the detailed questions that have been asked rather than just giving her normal 10-minute homily in relation to why anything the opposition says or raises in this space is bad.</span>

Everyone knows China is an economy on the rise. Perhaps Australia and the opposition should take some note of the fact that this growing economy wants to get ahead in the clean energy space. What does that say about where China believes the global economy will move? I also make the point that China has indicated it will introduce—</span>

Out of the mouth of your Prime Minister—for whom, Senator Bernardi, I know you have enormous regard—very clearly your policy did not expect or anticipate that the world would move before you introduced an emissions trading scheme. Four years later that is your new position because it is the only way you can justify the change in position we have seen from Howard to Nelson to Turnbull to Abbott. It is the only way you can justify it. But the historical record shows you went to an election very clearly accepting the same advice we did, which is that delaying increases costs. You were not waiting for the rest of the world to put in place a price on carbon.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MASON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  Just the other day I was looking at <span style="font-style:italic;">What a carbon price means for you: the pathway to a clean energy future</span>. There are very few copies of this left because, I understand, most of them were sent back to Ms Gillard and Mr Combet. They are about as rare as Shakespeare's first folio. But I did manage to find one. It says on page 7:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The economy will continue to grow as Australia embraces a clean energy future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Implicitly, the government is arguing that this tax promotes growth. No doubt they think it is a case of the higher the tax the greater the growth. We might want to tell the Greeks about that one! On page 7 it continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A carbon price is not a tax on households—it will be paid by Australia’s biggest polluters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As if householders will not pick up the bill! They will pick up the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the document says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By 2020 the carbon price package will take 160 million tonnes of pollution out of the atmosphere every year. That’s the equivalent of taking forty-five million cars off the road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But how much will it lower world temperatures by? Approximately zero. I think it was the great American talk-show host Rush Limbaugh who said, 'No country has ever taxed itself into prosperity,' but that is what the Labor Party and the Greens think you can do—tax carbon into prosperity. Only Labor and the Greens, beholden as they are to this sort of magic-pudding thinking, could claim that a new tax will help the economy. Only Labor and the Greens could claim that a new tax is needed to save the planet, even though it will have no impact at all on temperature. Only Labor and the Greens could try to shackle this country with a new tax even though similar policies have already cost one Prime Minister his job and even though the current proposal has sent Labor's primary vote to its lowest levels ever recorded in Australian history. This carbon tax does for Labor's vote what it cannot do for global temperatures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost two years ago, nearly to the day, I stood here along with my colleagues in this chamber arguing against a similarly harebrained idea—the CPRS—embraced by Labor. During the debate two years ago, the coalition argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is ultimate folly to try to rush through and pass an emissions trading scheme before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen and before our major trading partners introduce similar schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Guess what? Copenhagen was a dismal failure, as my colleague suggested it would be, and, two years on, none of our major trading competitors—not one; and they are the resource rich, trade exposed economies—are at all close to introducing similar schemes at home. We heard what the Canadian foreign minister said the other day: an emissions trading scheme is not on the agenda in Canada at all. In the United States, even when President Obama had huge majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives, he did not introduce a scheme because he knew it would be against the national interest of the US. Brazil, Russia, India and China—none of them is going to introduce a scheme. Before anyone shouts out 'what about the European Union?' I remind you that, as you know, it is a small, limp and corrupt market useful only for spivs, speculators and organised crime. It has been a disaster of a marketplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that, at a time when world economic growth is in the doldrums and has slowed to a crawl, no other competitor country is keen to enter into a sort of economic suicide pact. So, with a sickening sense of deja vu, two years later we are once again debating the same issues, and Labor and the Greens still don't get it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some questions which Labor still cannot address. Why would you do something that you know goes against the national interest and against the interests of the people you are supposed to represent? Why would you disadvantage a kid from Bankstown who is doing a diploma and wants to get a job in the mining industry? Why would you want to impose extra burdens and costs on a working family in Caboolture which is already struggling in difficult times? Why would you want to make it more difficult for a small business to carry on, employ people and contribute to its local community? Why would you want to punish your own people—why would you want to punish Australians—with a tax of such severity that no other country in the world has chosen to punish its people with a similarly severe tax? Why would you want to go it alone when none of the other major emitters and none of our major competitors are shackling their economies with similar schemes? Why would you want to impose a new tax in the name of fighting climate change even though that tax would have no impact at all on climate change?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know—the coalition knows, Labor knows and even the Greens know—that China is the largest emitter in the world and that India is the third largest. According to the 1990 benchmarks, China's emissions will have grown by 500 per cent and India's by 350 per cent by 2020. We now know that China is building two new coal fired power stations a week and that any reductions in emissions which Australia might achieve will be completely swallowed up in a matter of weeks—if not days—by the increases in China. We now know that, even according to the government's own documents, between 2010 and 2020 Australia's own carbon emissions will increase by eight per cent. That is what the government says—Australia's own emissions will increase by eight per cent. We now know that should current trends continue, and there are no signs at the moment that any competitor country is willing to change its course, global carbon dioxide emissions will increase by 43 per cent by 2035. We now know that this tax will make Australian businesses less competitive. We now know that this tax will push the cost of living up. We now know that this tax will not result in any real environmental gain and that regional Australia will be hardest hit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask again: why are Labor and the Greens doing this? The answer is pretty simple. They are doing it because of moral vanity, the vain belief that the Left knows best and is the world's conscience; they are doing it because of guilt that Australian capitalism has made us one of the most prosperous and most successful nations on earth; and they are doing it because of self-loathing, or at least because of a deep scepticism about the value of our society. Moral vanity, guilt, self-loathing—the three great contributions to the temper of politics by the Left in the 20th century. Moral vanity in feeling self-righteous, guilt for one's own prosperity and good fortune, self-loathing and deep scepticism of one's own society—the leftist trifecta. For this lot, for the Left, it is all a giant psychodrama, sacrificing everyone else and everything else for the sake of that warm feeling that they are right and everyone else is not only wrong but actually dangerous, deluded and immoral.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This carbon tax legislation is the best example there is of the absolute disconnect between Labor's heartland in the battlers' suburbs and Labor's trendy inner-city elites. There is no better example. It represents the ultimate act of sacrificing the interests and wellbeing of working families. Remember working families? When was the last time we heard about them? This represents sacrificing working families for the sake of international interests and the moral vanity of a trendy elite. In the Labor Party today the battlers now tug their forelocks to the trendies, the lefties and the inner-city luvvies. That is what has happened to the modern Labor Party. The Labor Party is now wholly subservient to the Greens monster, as Senator Madigan has here today—</span>

                    </a>  As Senator Madigan recognised earlier in this debate, Ben Chifley would never have sold out workers and working families in our country for the sake of satisfying the moral vanity of the inner-city trendies. Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard do not even bat an eyelid. The sad thing is that so many of Labor's senators and members in fact know this is a disgrace. They know it; the awful thing is that they have not got the courage to speak about it. The great tragedy of modern Labor is this: they have been cannibalised on the Left and they have sold out on the Right. The Prime Minister was certainly right when she said that this was a Labor government that had lost its way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember the light on the hill? The light on the hill has flickered out and been replaced by a green wind turbine. Welcome to the new Dark Green Ages. Labor's continuing quest for relevance means that it is now far more comfortable fighting for polar bears and dolphins than it is fighting for working families. That is modern Labor. Labor and the Greens will sell our country's prosperity to satisfy their moral vanity. They will mortgage our national interest to make themselves feel better. They will gamble our nation's future to satisfy their guilt and their self-loathing. They want to be heroes. They want to save the world. They want to make the state bigger and the people smaller. They want to shackle business and empower government. They want to take the money from the productive and distribute it amongst the rent seekers in Australia and abroad. The Labor-Greens carbon tax will damage Australia and, as we all know, it will do absolutely nothing for the environment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about embracing the future. It is not inevitable, it is not moral, it is not righteous and it is not enlightened. It is self-righteous. In the end the carbon tax is a tax conceived in guilt and given birth to upon a lie. It is the bastard child of the Australian Left. The idea that the working people of this country should foot the bill so that Labor and the Greens can feel good about themselves is the ultimate betrayal of the people this lot say they represent. They will sell out working families so they feel better, so they feel righteous and so moral vanity can come to the fore. That is what modern Labor stands for. It is the final act of a party that does not deserve to govern, does not deserve respect and does not deserve the support of ordinary working families and ordinary Australians. In the end we back the boy from Bankstown and this lot back the luvvy from Balmain. They do not deserve to govern this country.</span>

It had words such as 'leftist trifecta' and 'great psychodrama'—really very little to do with what is actually happening here. There are a number of issues to which I feel I should respond. I was asked: why is the government doing this? We are taking the best advice of Australia's and the world's scientists. We are listening to that advice. We are taking and listening to the advice of Australia's best economists and we are acting in accordance with that advice.</span>

                    </a>  Let me just remind you about our government: we have put more into hospitals than any government in previous history. What did you do? There was a billion dollars taken out of public hospitals; that is what Tony Abbott did. What have we done? Understanding that the pension needed to increase, we have put in place a historic increase to the pension for Australians who have worked hard. Twelve years under John Howard did not deliver that. A Labor government delivered that. A Labor government delivered paid parental leave—the first government ever to deliver paid parental leave. In 12 years you never delivered support for working women, working mothers—never. A Labor govern­ment delivered that. We have increased the childcare rebate. We have increased the amount of support that we give to working families through the childcare rebate. It never occurred under you. We put in place the carers supplement. We introduced additional family tax benefits and an education tax refund. And we abolished Work Choices, which you, Senator Mason, were so enthusiastic in supporting—just as all of you have been so enthusiastic to jump on board the bandwagon backing Qantas's right to lock out all its employees.</span>

We under­stand that managing the economy is about managing it for working Australians and their families. That work is never finished, and we will always continue to do that work, unlike those Johnny-come-latelies, who were in here on this side of the chamber telling us how wonderful Work Choices was—and I remember you, Senator Mason—and how wonderful it was for bosses to be able to sack people and for people to be able to have their penalty rates ripped away.

                    </a>  Yes, hear, hear! I will take that interjection from Senator Bernardi. They do not like working Australians, low-income Australians, getting more. We have given them more of the share of assistance than we have given high-income Australians. Let us have a look at what we are providing: an additional $510 per annum for couples combined on pensions; up to $110 per child under FTBA; up to $69 for FTBB; and additional funding, as I said, for pensions and also for self-funded retirees who held the Commonwealth seniors health card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also put in place as part of this assistance package, tax reform. We will triple the tax-free threshold. That will give a benefit not only to low-income Australians but also to secondary-income earners. This is a very important part of the government's package. It will increase participation and it will give a tax cut to every Australian earning under $80,000 a year. We have unashamedly skewed this assistance to low-income Australia—and the opposition hate that.</span>

Do you know what they are actually saying? They do not like low-income Australians—pensioners and people earning under 80 grand—getting more of the assistance than high-income Australians. That is what they are actually saying.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So do not come into this chamber and lecture us about low-income Australians. You are the party that in government never provided the sorts of assistance—paid parental leave, increased childcare rebate, increased pensions and ripping away Work Choices—that we have provided. You have never put in place the funding for health and education and the investment in Australian families that we have put in place. We put in place these things because we understand that our job is to manage the economy for the benefit of working families.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  I am afraid I will not add to the theatre of this morning, but I do have some questions that I want to raise that I think are serious issues with respect to the pricing of electricity in this country and the price pressures of electricity as a result of this scheme and whether we can improve it. The chamber knows what my views are—that we should not be proceeding with this matter—and there is an amendment that I have introduced, and I think the opposition has one as well that is on the table, to defer this whole scheme until after the next election. I think there are some important principles there. The issues I genuinely want to ask the minister about relate to the concerns expressed by the Energy Supply Association of Australia. Those concerns are quite significant in terms of whether the design of the scheme in its current form could lead to unnecessary increases in electricity prices. I refer to the front-page story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> by Lenore Taylor, Peter Martin and David Wroe headed 'Tax flaw: power bills may rise 20%' The Energy Supply Association has written to me and has written to my colleagues saying that the plans under this scheme to force immediate payment for forward dated emissions permits rather than the deferred payment allowed under the Rudd government's emissions trading scheme, the CPRS, could lead to the consequence, perhaps unintended, of unnecessary increases in electricity prices. That is an area of significant concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should indicate that Steven Munchenberg from the Australian Bankers Association has a different view. I respect that there are different views out there that you can have a derivatives market. I do not want to misquote Mr Munchenberg, because he contacted me in good faith to express the views of the banks in relation to this and to reject the Energy Supply Association of Australia's arguments. But I think there are some valid concerns there about whether the design of the scheme in its current form not allowing for deferred payments is going to cause unnecessary increases in supply costs. If you do have a derivatives market or a secondary market in terms of these matters—as the Australian Bankers Association has indicated, and I think it does have a valid point of view on this—will that market in itself be unnecessarily inflationary and lead to price increases?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think these are legitimate concerns. I would like to hear from both the government and the opposition on what their views are in relation to this. It is all well and good to oppose a piece of legislation, but if there is an opportunity to try and improve a piece of legislation then I think that is what we are meant to do here in the Senate. The key role of the Senate is not only to play that scrutiny role but to improve legislation even if we disagree with it. If the numbers make it inevitable that it will get through but there is an opportunity to improve it, we should explore that opportunity. If it is a matter of improving the legislation then I think it is incumbent on us to try to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like the minister to respond to this. Minister, you understand the spirit in which I am asking these questions. This is not a polemical debate; it is a practical debate. Will the design of this scheme in its current form, unlike the CPRS, lead to unnecessary increases in electricity prices? I reserve the right to move amendments in relation to this in the next couple of hours, but I really want to genuinely engage with the government in relation to what I think are important issues that have been raised by the Energy Supply Association.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deregulation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I will first give a response on the ESAA modelling, which I think was referenced by Senator Xenophon. The advice I have is that it was a hypothetical exercise rather than an attempt to estimate what will actually happen to electricity contracting under the package. The modelling report itself says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The study does not purport to project what <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> happen in terms of contracting levels, as they are influenced by numerous and countervailing influences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government remains confident in the findings of the Treasury modelling which shows the impact of a carbon price on electricity prices to be an increase of around 10 per cent, or about $3.30 a week, for the average household. I can say to Senator Xenophon that there was certainly a lot of consultation with this sector both in the context of the CPRS and in the context of this package. As part of the package before the chamber there is a very significant allocation to the Energy Security Fund of some $5½ billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy issue that you are referring to is the purchase of future carbon units and how that is managed. It is correct that under the CPRS there were a range of deferred payment arrangements in relation to the auctions of future vintage carbon units. The advice I have is that deferred payment arrangements increase the administrative complexity of auctions and inhibit the development of secondary markets to manage carbon pricing risk. The government is offering loans to emissions intensive generators who are otherwise unable to secure finance on reasonable terms to buy future vintage carbon units at auction. This addresses working capital constraints directly without interfering in the functioning of the auction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a different mechanism that is being proposed in the package before the chamber to that which was previously proposed, both of which deal with this issue. But the advice I have is that the loan provision to which I have referred addresses working capital constraints directly without interfering with the functioning of the auction. The Energy Security Council can advise the Treasurer to provide further assistance to generators, such as loans, if that is required to safeguard energy security. The policy question here is how the companies manage their carbon price exposure. The expectation the government has is that the private sector will continue to offer hedging services to generators and there are the additional safeguards to which I have referred in the energy security package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You invited the opposition to respond as well. If there is a concern about volatility in the short term and the impact on the electricity prices, I would make the point about—I cannot recall if it was the ESAA or some other industry association that said this—the likely price impact of the oppo­sition's commitment to repeal. If they retain their position—I do not think they will, but if they do—that is likely to have two potential consequences. The first is it makes it more difficult to engage in long-term contracts, which obviously has an impact. The second is that it also makes hedging more difficult because of the inherent uncertainty. But really the issue goes to what the policy mechanism to manage this is. You are correct to say there is a difference between this and the CPRS, but the advice I have is these other arrangements deal with this in an appropriate way. I am also reminded that obviously there is a three-year fixed period, which is relevant here.</span>

The minister has acknowledged that under the CPRS there was a deferred price mechanism. Presumably there would have been modell­ing done and advice sought as to the difference between the former scheme, the CPRS, and the current scheme in terms of the impact on electricity prices. I presume that modelling would have been done by Treasury. As to what the price impacts would be on consumers, I would be grateful if the minister could indicate whether any modelling was done on the price impacts of having a deferred payment scheme or paying upfront, as this particular scheme is seeking to do.</span>

This all comes down to the way in which companies manage their carbon price exposure. Pre-CPRS, as you said, there was deferred payment. In these arrangements we have the $5.5 billion, we have the Energy Security Council and we have the capacity to offer loans. This is assuming, of course, that the market does not deal with this. I know that the Australian Bankers Association had views on the previous occasion about whether deferred payment was in fact required. I assume the senator, because he has taken an interest in this, would be aware of the views of the financial sector that the market has the capacity to provide instruments to manage this risk without government interfering with the auction mechanism. For that reason, the government put in place the policy parameters that I have outlined to deal with this.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I want to go to the issue of what the impact will be of requesting upfront payments, if you like, under this scheme compared to the deferred payments in the CPRS. The Energy Supply Association of Australia complained in a letter to me, and I think to other senators: 'This effectively amounts to energy companies being asked to provide working capital to the Australian government which could be in the order of $10 billion.' They go on to say that they commissioned analysis from economic modeller ACIL Tasman and that this analysis found that reduced electricity contracting could increase volatility in the electricity market and increase retail electricity prices by 10 per cent in a single year for small users—households and small businesses—and up to 15 per cent for large users. They say that these rises in electricity prices are in addition to the carbon price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge what Senator Wong, the minister, said in relation to the Australian Bankers Association. They have a different view. They say that you could have a secondary market and that financial instruments could deal with this and manage the risk. So that is the difference between the two arguments. The question I am asking is: was some modelling done by the government on the impact of having deferred payments under the CPRS, as distinct from having upfront payments with this scheme? Surely there would have been some modelling done on such a fundamental aspect of the scheme design.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note an article written by Lenore Taylor in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> last Friday headed 'Ministers in final plea to delay carbon repayments'. It makes reference to the New South Wales energy minister, Chris Hartcher, and Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser. So you have a Liberal or coalition government in New South Wales and a Labor government in Queensland and the report says that both have written to the federal government 'in a last-ditch bid to win amendments to the carbon tax legislation that could prevent power prices soaring higher than forecast'. This again goes to the issue of deferring payments. So they are the issues. Was there some modelling done? What do you say to two ministers from two different political parties who have concerns about this—the Labor government in Queensland and the coalition government in New South Wales? I raise these issues because I am nervous that we are going to push up prices more than we need to. Given that the CPRS, the old scheme under the Rudd government, had deferred payments, I am trying to work out what the best public policy is to minimise the impact on households.</span>

This issue came up in the joint house inquiry. We heard from the Energy Supply Association, but from further discussions subsequent to that and after thinking about it, I think the difference between the CPRS and this scheme in terms of this particular issue is that the CPRS only had one year of a known price, whereas with this scheme we are going to a fixed price mechanism for three years before going to flexible pricing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From my point of view, that does make a difference on this issue. As Senator Xenophon said, this is one of the issues that were raised that requires consideration. I went back to the minister's office to raise it with them and to ask whether this is really the issue it is being made out to be, because the government obviously has the benefit of a lot more confidential information than we have in relation to this matter. I am led to believe that the three years does make a substantial difference in the circumstances, so I would appreciate it if the minister, in answering part of what Senator Xenophon raised, could also refer to that matter.</span>

I think that I understand what Senator Milne is referencing, although I was not involved in the committee. The proposition about the three-year fixed price is an important one. It means that there is a longer period over which this scheme is transitioned for all sectors before a floating price comes into play. That means that the products around hedging carbon risk have a longer period before the floating price comes in. That is of relevance. This policy proposition comes down to how generators will hedge carbon risk. I referred in my opening answer to the modelling to which Senator Xenophon just referred, so I have already responded to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of the two states and the different political parties, I would make the point that it is not surprising that treasurers of states that own generators might have a consistent position around this. I suspect that that is not party political but treasurers looking to the interests of their states. What the Commonwealth has to look at is what the sensible policy for the transition is. For the reasons that I have outlined, we think that the framework that we have put in place, with $5.5 billion and the capacity to provide financing from government if the market does not provide that, is able to deal with the risks that you have raised.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I am grateful for the minister's answer, but that brings me back to the question about what modelling, what assessment and what risk analysis were done by the government when it switched from a deferred payment scheme under the old CPRS that we were debating about two years ago this month—and I am sure that Senator Cormann will correct me if I am wrong on that—to what is now being proposed. You have the Electricity Suppliers Association of Australia concerned about it; the Australian Bankers Association disagrees. But you have two state governments who have expressed concerns. Notwithstanding that the Queensland government's interest in this is by virtue of being the owner of generators, if there are price effects, as found in economic modelling done by ACIL Tasman on behalf of the Electricity Suppliers Association of Australia, they are matters that deserve to be considered and rebutted by the government if the government believes them to be wrong. What modelling did the government do when comparing the CPRS and this scheme? What assessment was undertaken in terms of the potential impact on prices in the electricity market?</span>

Given that under the CPRS that was debated in this place two years ago there was going to be a deferred payment scheme rather than an upfront scheme, which is what this scheme is proposing, why wasn't some modelling done based on the CPRS to determine what the differences in price rises would be if we had a scheme in place under which deferred payments were allowed, as was proposed by the CPRS?</span>

I am grateful to the minister for her answer. I will try to put this another way. Given the concerns expressed by the Electricity Suppliers Association of Australia and by the New South Wales and Queensland governments—two governments of different political hues—will the government continue to look at this issue in the three-year transitional period proposed by this legislation so that, if it becomes apparent that there has been the unintended consequence of greater price rises as a result of the current design of the scheme in respect of upfront payments rather than deferred payments, the government can consider changing it? Will the government consider that or is the government saying that once this is passed that is the point of no return in terms of changing to deferred payments?</span>

But I am advised that the propositions in there assume a failure of financial markets to provide the sorts of hedging products that would be required. That is the assumption in that modelling. The proposition that is being put forward is that therefore these different price impacts will occur. First, we do not accept that the financial markets will not be able to provide such products. Second, even if that were the case—which we do not accept—the government has arrangements in place through the package to provide financing, including on the advice of the council. So there are a number of assumptions in what you raise. First, there is the question of whether the market will be able to provide these. We think yes and financial providers have also indicated that to be the case, which is important. Second, even if that is all wrong, the government has said that the Treasurer can authorise the provision of financing on certain terms if required. There are a range of policy requirements around that. So I think there are range of safeguards on this issue, and I again say that in many ways the larger risk is the coalition's talk—although I know they seem to talk about this a bit less—about the effect on electricity prices of the uncertainty imposed by the blood-oath of rescinding this, because that obviously is a signal to markets as well. Having said that, I suspect it will go the same way as their superannuation policy.</span>

Wouldn't that be the prudent approach to take, given concerns that have been expressed, from a number of credible sources—from two state governments, from the Electricity Supply Association and from modelling done by ACIL Tasman? Would it not be reasonable to at least to consider that, as to whether then the minister needs to use regulation making powers to try and rectify any potential risks? In other words, given the concerns that have been raised, will there at least be some modelling done to deal with those concerns one way or the other?</span>

If that monitoring showed that modelling was required then that is obviously something we would take advice on, but for the reasons I have outlined we think the policy framework we have put in place is a sensible one.</span>

The government's position—and it would be the position of the Australian Bankers Association as well, and of those that disagree with the Electricity Supply Association—is that you could have secondary markets in place to manage the risk, to hedge the risk. I think that is a fair summary. But wouldn't it be better to try and deal with the problem directly rather than relying on a secondary market? All I am asking is: will the government have an open mind in looking at issues of the risks involved that have been raised and, if necessary, to commission modelling on these issues, given the very live concerns that have been raised by two state governments, of different political persuasions; the Electricity Supply Association; and the modelling carried out by ACIL Tasman?</span>

What I would say, again, is this: this is about how you manage that uncertainty. What you are flagging, as opposed to 'advocating'—I accept I verballed you—is a policy proposition that says: let's fiddle with the auction process within government to manage this risk. We say: no, we believe financial markets will, as they do now, provide the ability for firms to hedge risks. Let's remember, firms hedge risk all the time; not just on a carbon price but on a whole range of issues: exchange rates, whatever the commodity price is and so forth; this is not a new concept. If we are wrong in that then the government has the capacity to provide financing through the mechanisms I have outlined.</span>

I would like to follow on from some of the points that Senator Xenophon has raised. Perhaps, just for the benefit of the base principles of dealing with this issue of the forward-selling of permits, and whether or not the funds from the forward-selling of those permits to electricity generators are collected at the point of sale or indeed in the vintage year at which they become available for use, could the minister explain as clearly as possible to the Senate what the policy rationale was behind the government changing its approach on the payment times for these permits from the CPRS model, which did defer the payment—and therefore did of course defer the risks and the need for this type of hedging, at least in terms of the costs of those payments—compared with this model, which ESAA claims will cause detriment because there is this requirement for this upfront payment? So, before we go too much further into some of the other more specific questions, can I just get from the minister what the policy rationale was for changing from the CPRS approach that ensured this particular problem was not a factor, to this approach that does bring this particular problem into at least debate and discussion.</span>

I will repeat what I said: deferred payment arrangements increase the administrative complexity of options and inhibit the development of secondary markets to manage carbon pricing risk. Obviously, secondary markets actually provide firms with an indication of where the price is going in the future—that is important for business. I have also indicated the government has said we will offer loans to emissions-intensive generators who are otherwise unable to secure finance on reasonable terms, to buy future vintage carbon units at auction. This addresses working capital constraints directly, without interfering with the function of the auction. We are also providing $5½ billion of assistance under the Energy Security Fund to the most emissions-intensive generators.</span>

But perhaps, Minister, if you could provide us with some information and explanation as to who advised and informed the government that the previous model was a flawed model and that this then is a better model, and who actually is supporting the theory and approach that you have just outlined that there are in fact benefits from bringing the payment forward. Obviously, the electricity generators themselves have concerns and do not see there to be a benefit. So who is actually supporting the government in arguing that the bringing forward of the payment actually is of benefit?</span>

I have talked at some length about the tax package. It is as a result of the Henry review having reported. This is a very good and much better assistance package because it combines a tax reform element with the assistance, which is of more benefit to participation than the previous assistance. So, there are parts that are different and parts that are similar. The policy proposition is the one I have outlined on quite a number of occasions. It is a very cogent proposition that we have put forward. I am not sure how much further I can assist the senator with it. I have outlined on a number of occasions now the policy rationale behind this.</span>

You also indicated that the Treasury modelling did not assume the deferred payment scenario. Minister, are you able to advise the chamber whether the Treasury modelling did assume or believe there would be a reduction in the forward contracting for electricity? It is of course one thing for it not to assume the deferred payment scenario and, therefore, as you rightly said, presumably it then did assume that payments would be made at the time that the forward purchase of these permits was locked in. However, does it accept the principle, to some extent at least, of the scenario outlined by the ESAA that there will be a reduction in forward contracting of electricity prices and, therefore, the greater risk and uncertainty, and the possible higher use of spot price electricity and, with that, the potential flow-on for increases in electricity prices? But, very particularly, does the Treasury modelling that was undertaken accept that there is a chance, in places, that there will be a reduction in forward contracting?</span>

I note that we have got to the point now where you have confirmed that those who informed the Treasury modelling say that there was no belief there would be a reduction in contracting, but the electricity generators obviously believe that there will be a reduction in forward contracting. The generators believe that, if there is a reduction in forward contracting, it will have a flow-through effect on electricity prices and of course on prices for consumers. Does the government at least accept the principle that if you have it wrong, if there is a reduction in forward contracting of electricity, the way in which the electricity market works and the way the Energy Supply Association of Australia argue that it works there would be an additional impact on electricity prices above that which has been forecast?</span>

On the broader issue about electricity prices I would make the point that without a price on carbon we will continue to see a stalling of investment in our energy generation sector, in particular. This lack of investment feeds through to electricity prices, but in that world there is no assistance available to households.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I am not at all convinced that the minister has given a clear answer on whether the government accepts that if there is a reduction in forward contracting for electricity there will be a commensurate flow-through of increased price and volatility in the electricity pricing market. It is a pretty straightforward proposition; it is one that the government can and has rejected on whether or not that will happen. But there is conflict­ing modelling presented by the Energy Supply Association of Australia—conflicting modelling that says the opposite to that which the government's Treasury modelling has assumed. So, if the government's Treasury modelling is wrong, and instead the ACIL Tasman modelling done by the ESAA is correct, then do you accept that there is a risk that forward contracting could be reduced? The particular question I was asking on this occasion was: if that scenario eventuates, if there is a reduction in forward contracting for electricity, does the government accept that that means there is a potential for greater volatility and higher prices in that market? It is fairly straightforward and, if you have answered it before, do the chamber the courtesy of answering it again. But from your answers previously I cannot see a clear-cut and direct answer to that very direct question.</span>

We are not here to debate hypotheticals; we are here to debate the package. I have explained that the indepen­dent modellers on this issue, which we used as part of the Treasury modelling, did not anticipate a reduction in forward contracting. I have also explained that the advice of financial institutions is that such products would be available. I have explained that if the market did not work as anticipated the government has made clear it will provide loans for market participants to address these working capital constraints that have been asserted. I have also explained that we are providing $5½ billion under the Energy Security Fund. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also explained on a number of occasions now that if the opposition do care about uncertainty in the market, which is an issue that goes against forward contracting and management of risk through the longer term, then they would not be opposing this and they would not be suggesting that they have some blood oath to rescind it. That of itself puts uncertainty into the market and would therefore add to the very policy risks that the senator has referred to.</span>

The Energy Security Council will advise the government of the provision of loans in these circumstances. Both forms of loans will be priced on terms that encourage generators to provide private finance where possible and there will be an assessment of the potential recipient's capacity to repay the loan.</span>

Again, that hardly provides any certainty to the industry in the passage of this legislation. In particular your statement that it will be structured in a way so as to encourage generators to seek the commercial provision of loans, is that an indication that the packages as structured by the government would be at rates above commercial rates or at terms that are less favourable than commercial terms, meaning that really there is only one offer on the table?</span>

The first is loans to emissions intensive generators who are otherwise unable to procure finance on reasonable terms to buy future vintage carbon auctions. This is to address working capital constraints. I am advised that auctions will not be engaged in until the 2013-14 financial year and obviously the details of those terms will be the subject of further consultation between Treasury and the sector. There is a second capacity to provide loans in the event that this is required to safeguard energy security. That is amongst the assistance that the Energy Security Council is able to advise the Treasurer about. Obviously the priority there is energy security.</span>

I am seeing nodding from the advisers, so the minister will correct me if that is incorrect. Minister, are you able to inform the Senate in terms of the budget estimates that the government has undertak­en what the fiscal impact would be and what the reduction in revenue from the sale of permits would be were those revenues not to be collected in the 2013-14 financial year but instead to be collected in what I assume would be the 2015-16 financial year, being the vintage year for those permits?</span>

Of the revenue from the sale of permits the government expects to bank in 2013-14, how much of that is from the sale of fixed-price permits that obviously are for that vintage year and how much of that revenue is from the sale of non-fixed-price permits from future vintage years?</span>

We do not propose to engage in a further costings exercise at the senator's request. He could of course support the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill, and then he could cost this policy, if that in fact is his policy.</span>

It is my job to provide you with the budget quality costings that we have provided—far more than anything your party has done since you have been in opposition. So we have provided the fiscal impact and the cash impact and we have provided those fiscal tables in the context of the legislation. So do not verbal me and pretend that we have not been transparent about that. As I said, we have been far more transparent than you have with the $70-plus billion of cuts to services you have to find to fund this and other policies.</span>

                    </a>  I am sure the chair can. It is interesting, when we get to talking about the budget questions, just how evasive the minister gets on this matter. Today we see debate out there that once again this government's budget forecasts may yet be proven wrong and once again their promises of returning the budget to surplus may look terribly, grossly overly optimistic. We see a situation in which the Labor government, who have never managed to hand down a surplus—and Labor govern­ments of course have not managed to hand down a surplus since 1990—will never actually manage to get there. They keep promising, they keep saying it will be in a couple of years, but, as crunch time approaches, you can see that it is going to get pushed out and pushed out even further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The remarkable thing is that this carbon tax package adds to that deficit. You would have thought, when a government introduces a new tax measure that brings in around $9 billion per annum, that it might somehow actually help put the budget back towards surplus, but this new tax measure only pushes the budget further out into deficit. The question I asked the minister was a pretty straightforward question. It was simply the question of: in 2013-14 and 2014-15, how much of the revenue from the sale of permits is from the sale of fixed-price permits for those vintage years and how much is from the sale of non-fixed-price permits for future vintage years? That is all. I am not asking for some elaborate breakdown of the budget costings. I am not asking for her to tell me which industry sectors she expects each of the permits to come from. I am not asking for her to look in some technical or elaborate way at breaking it down amongst the alleged 500 companies that the sale of permits revenue will come from. I am simply asking a fairly logical question, I would have thought, as to how much of the revenue is relevant to the financial year in question and how much of it is for permits relevant to future financial years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should surely be able to answer that question. That should surely be a question that is very relevant, very germane, to this Committee of the Whole process of debate; very relevant to the issues that Senator Xenophon started the line of questioning on about what the policy implications are, what the cost implications are, of this approach to the forward selling of permits to electricity generators. If you are going to sell them to electricity generators in advance and expect the money in advance then it is only reasonable to know, within the budget, what the implications of that policy decision are. It is only through knowing that that there can be a thorough understanding of what the implications are of any amendments that Senator Xenophon might be considering on this matter. I note that even Senator Milne said that this was an issue that requires consideration, so even the government's partners in this carbon tax legislation, the Greens, acknowledge that there are concerns here, and they acknowledge that they could be genuine concerns. They are genuine con­cerns because, if what the Electricity Supply Association of Australia says is correct and true, there is an additional cost impact for electricity consumers above and beyond what is already there, above and beyond the 10 per cent modelling that the government claims. We now know that that is the case because the government has confirmed that Treasury modelling does not believe that there will be any drop-off in the forward contracting of electricity. If the government got that wrong—and it would not be the first time that this government has got anything wrong—then we would have a situation where there could be a drop-off in forward contracting and the flow-on effect of that would be that consumers would see greater price volatility in the electricity market and for small businesses, house­holders and others that would flow through to potentially higher prices, according to the ESAA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has decided it is going to go down this alternative policy path where it takes the money and banks it in advance. That happens to make the fiscal impact of this carbon tax look better and healthier in the years 2013-14 and 2014-15 than would otherwise be the case. It is worth noting that the money that comes in does in some way boost the revenue in those early years for the government than would otherwise be the case. So the question then is: how much does it boost it by? The only way to ascertain that and to ascertain what budgetary implications of any amendments that the Greens, Senator Xenophon or anyone else might consider is to know how that is split up. It is a pretty straightforward split. It is a pretty straight­forward question. Minister, how much of the revenue in 2013-14 and 2014-15 is attribut­able to the sale of fixed price permits in those vintage years versus the sale of non-fixed price permits in future vintage years?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  I have a question about the impact of the carbon tax on electricity generators, specifically in relation to the government's so-called transitional assistance package. Minister, how much of the $5.5 billion transitional assistance package for electricity generators is expected to go to the No. 1 emitter in Australia, who the Prime Minister would describe as the No. 1 polluter out of 500 polluters—Macquarie Generation? Given they are responsible for 23.4 million tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;"></span>on the latest available information and would be expected to pay about $540 million worth of carbon tax, how much transitional assistance will Macquarie Generation get under the carbon tax package that the government has put before the parliament?</span>

Obviously, I will get some advice on that. We have set out some principles on the allocation of that fund and those principles include the energy intensity of the relevant generator, so there is a finite pool of funding via free permits and cash which is to be allocated. The permits will be allocated by the regulator and the cash will be allocated by the department. I do not think in those circumstances it would be appropriate or probably possible to in fact identify the exact quantum to any particular market participant.</span>

We have laid out the policy principles around the allocation of this assistance. There will obviously be ongoing consultation with industry about the detail of that. Again I would say it is less a commercial-in-confidence issue than a market issue. I do not think it would be appropriate, in the context of a very substantial amount of funding, for me to be indicating an estimate of what particular market participants might receive from this assistance package. I think what is in the public interest is what is in the explanatory memorandum and in the package itself around the principles for the allocation of funding. How that translates to the factual circumstances of particular generators is a matter to be dealt with either between the regulator and those generators in relation to the free permits or the regulator and the department.</span>

That sounds, quite frankly, unbelievable, Minister.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I am well aware of the provisions that are on the public record. I have read through them. They have been subject to discussions at a Senate carbon tax inquiry hearing. The question I am asking you—and you are well aware that I had already flagged that I was not asking for a dollar figure—is whether or not there is going to be any transitional assistance at all for a very signi­ficant electricity generator like Macquarie Generation as a result of how your government has structured the transitional assistance package. That is a question that obviously goes directly to the impact of the carbon tax legislation on energy security and the cost of electricity moving forward, so don't point me to things that we can all read. I am asking you very directly about your understanding of the implications of the way you are proposing this legislation should operate for a significant electricity generator like Macquarie Generation.</span>

I have reverted back to the period pre-election. But this is a list that has been put out there by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. It is very clear and on the public record that Macquarie Generation was responsible in that particular year—I think it was 2009-10—for 23.4 million tonnes of CO2; which, if you multiply that by $23 a tonne, will take you to $538,402,193.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Your government has talked about the fact that there is transitional assistance available for electricity generators to assist them through the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy. I want to know if Macquarie Generation is going to be eligible for any transitional assistance whatsoever under the $5.5 billion transitional assistance package. That is a pretty straightforward question. The answer could be as short as 'yes' or 'no'. That obviously might lead to some other questions for you to describe what sort of assistance the highest emitting electricity generator would be able to access. If they are not able to access any transitional assistance, I would be interested in knowing why that is. Given that they are responsible for 23.4 million tonnes of emissions, it stands to reason that they are a very significant supplier of electricity into the National Electricity Market.</span>

We are providing assistance to the most emissions intensive generators in the country wherever they may be. Assistance is targeted in this way because the modelling and expert advice indicate that this is the best way to reducing risk to energy security. I have outlined the nature of the energy security fund and I am again saying to the senator that I do not think other ministers, including from your side of government, would have gone through, in the context of a whole-of-economy-and-sector reform, what a particular company would get in relation to a program that had yet not passed the parliament. I do not think that is appropriate. I think what is sensible is to go through the policy rationale for why assistance has been structured in the way it has. I have done that, but we can do this a fair bit all day. You can move from one company to another and another. What I would say is that they would get no assistance under your package.</span>

I do feel sorry for Senator Cormann, because he is trying to be the fiscally sensible one and he got rolled this week because he very sensibly said, 'If we oppose the MRRT, we should oppose the spending measures, because we haven't funded it.' But then he got rolled—Mr Robb did not even get invited to the meeting—and they are now, again, engaging in more unfunded expenditure.

We are, clearly, providing assistance to the most emissions intensive generators in the country. I accept there are some generators who do not agree with that decision. The reason the government have taken that policy decision is that the advice to us from modelling and from experts is that this is the best way of reducing risks to energy security. That is why we are structuring the package in the way that we have.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  Reading between the lines, I take it that what the minister is saying is that, if you are a coal fired power station that is less polluting—has less emissions—and has a lower emissions intensity, then you are going to be worse off under this package than if you are a higher-polluting coal fired power station. If you are a lower emissions inten­sive coal fired power station, you will cop the whole cost. That is $540 million in additional tax for Macquarie Generation, which happens to be responsible for 40 per cent of the power generation in New South Wales, or about 13 per cent of the power generation across the whole eastern seaboa­rd. So they get nothing—they get zero; that is what I am reading between your lines—and the reason they get nothing is that they just happen to be a too-environmentally-friendly coal fired electricity generator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the higher polluters need more assistance, and I hear what you are saying there, Minister Wong. But let me just make this point: you talked about how they would get no assistance under our policy; of course they will not get any assistance—because they will not be whacked with a $540 million tax bill either! There will not be a $540 million tax on Macquarie Generation under our policy, Minister. And, if you are not going to get whacked with a $540 million tax, you will not need to access transitional assistance. But your government is going to whack Macquarie Generation, which just happens to be responsible for 40 per cent of the electricity generation in New South Wales, with a $540 million tax. Why aren't you giving them any transitional assistance? Because they are too environmentally efficient; their emissions intensity is too low. That is what you are saying. It is the same with Verve Energy or Griffin Energy in Western Australia. They are not polluting enough. If their emissions intensity was above 1, rather than below 1, they would get transitional assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister can stand there with her back to the chamber and try and ignore us as much as she likes, but that is the effect of the government's policy. The government, very disingenuously, refers to the 500 biggest polluters without telling people that those 500 biggest emitters are either the energy suppliers that are helping Australia keep the lights on or some of Australia's major employers, all of whom have made significant efforts to reduce their emissions intensity, to reduce their emissions and to improve their energy efficiency over the last 10 to 20 years, without a carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence that we have had at the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation from organisati­ons like Macquarie Generation, and Verve Energy in Western Australia, is that they will be asked to take 100 per cent of the tax without any transitional assistance whatso­ever because they are too environmentally efficient and their emissions intensity is not high enough. In the case of Verve Energy, they are saying this is going to be a net cost to their bottom line. They will have to pass it on, either through increased electricity prices or through the states' taxpayers. Will there be any effect on emissions as a result? No. In the case of Western Australia, WA is not part of the National Electricity Market. Western Australia is an energy island, Minister. You may not have realised that when you put your policy together. Minister Wong is now, finally, turning around; we have managed to get her to turn around and focus on what is happening in the chamber rather than keeping her back to us. But, Minister, Western Australia is an energy island—there she goes again; she is obviously not interested in what is being talked about in the chamber. Western Australia, for energy security reasons, needs to have a diversity of energy sources. We will continue to have to rely on a combination of coal, gas and various renewables—but coal and gas to a significant degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Senate committee inquiry, we asked witnesses what the effects would be in terms of the use of coal as part of power generation in Western Australia. Well, Verve Energy has to pay $200 million in additional tax, and the effect is going to be zero. Verve Energy will not be able to close down one single coal fired power station. In fact, the evidence we got is that it is most likely that, even with a carbon tax, the next new power station in Western Australia will be a coal fired power station, and that is for energy supply reasons. So this is just a net cost that is going to be imposed on the people of Western Australia, in the context of Verve Energy, through increased electricity prices, through increased taxes or through reduced services at a state level. There is zero, zilch, transitional assistance from this government in order to do it. The minister then says, 'There won't be any transitional assistance under your package.' No, there will not be. But there will not be a $540 million tax on Macquarie Generation, there will not be a $200 million tax on Verve Energy, there will not be a $180 million tax on Alinta Energy and there will not be a $161 million tax on Victoria Electricity. These are taxes that you are imposing, Minister, and in this chamber you cannot even bring yourself to say the words: 'Yes, you're right, Senator Cormann. Macquarie Generation is not going to get any transitional assistance under this package. Verve Energy is not getting any transitional assistance under this package. And the reason they are not getting any transitional assistance under this package is that their emissions intensity is too low. They are too environmentally efficient. They have done too good a job in keeping their emissions intensity as low as it can be.' That is why they have to cop the whole force of the carbon tax. That is why they have to pay 100 per cent of the carbon tax. If only they had not done what they could to keep their emissions intensity as low as possible, if only they had kept their emissions intensity above the factor of one, then your govern­ment would rush out and give them billions of dollars in transitional assistance. That is one of the many ludicrous parts of this package that your government, Minister, has put forward—a carbon tax that of course the Australian people were promised we would never get. And here today you cannot even fess up and say the words: 'You're right. There is no transitional assistance whatso­ever—not one dime, not one cent; nothing, zilch—for companies like Macquarie Gener­ation or Verve Energy because they are too environmentally efficient', in your judgment, 'to warrant getting any assistance.' That is completely inappropriate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, you confected outrage when I made the observation that I did not believe that when the government put this package together they understood that Western Australia was an energy island. My question to you is: what are the features in this carbon tax package that give effect to a recognition that Western Australia is actually an energy island which has to be energy self-sufficient and which of course is going to be impacted very differently, and in an even worse fashion, by this carbon tax package as a result of the way you have structured it? When it comes to transitional assistance to energy suppliers under your package, what are the features in which you recognise that Western Australia is not part of the National Electricity Market but is in fact an energy island?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I find it highly amusing that Senator Cormann and those opposite are seeking to ask questions of the government regarding the operation of the various assistance packages which form part of the government's clean energy package and the set of bills being debated in committee this morning, because of course we all know that Senator Cormann and those opposite are completely opposed, in the whole, to those assistance packages. They are opposed to the Jobs and Competitiveness Program. They are opposed to the Steel Transformation Plan. They are opposed to the assistance that the government is proposing for the coal sector. They are opposed to our community support package, which will provide assistance for community based organisations to over time reduce their emissions intensity and improve their energy efficiency. And of course, importantly, they are opposed to the assistance package for households and the increases to pensions, which are an important part of the government's program. They are opposed to the payments to families. They are opposed to the additional payments that will be available for job seekers and students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these assistance measures are very important parts of the government's clean energy package because they provide the basis on which our economy will transform itself and move from an industrial based economy based on heavy carbon pollution to a clean energy future based on a transition to renewable fuels, and they make the transition much easier, particularly for households and those on low to middle incomes. That is the aim of the scheme: to target the assistance; to target the use of half of that revenue to where it is required the most—that is, to low- and middle- income earners. The assistance is not a one-off proposal. The increases to pensions and to family payments will grow in line with the increases in the carbon price. So I find it highly amusing that Senator Cormann and opposition senators are seeking to gain points by asking a series of questions associated with the assistance, particularly the assistance that is there for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is symbolic of the fact that Senator Cormann and those opposite do not under­stand the way the scheme will work and the fact that it is a market based mechanism. Those in the Liberal Party say they are all for the efficiency of markets and government getting out of the way when it comes to the running of our economy, but they are opposed to this market based mechanism. They are opposed to an emissions trading scheme, which of course our scheme will move to after the first three years. Senator Cormann has raised the issue of those who are doing the right thing, companies that are reducing their emissions, and the assistance that will be available to them; but he fails to comprehend the fact that through an emissions trading scheme there is a natural advantage for those companies who do the right thing and over time reduce their emissions. The advantage becomes the fact that they are able to generate permits, buy credits and sell those credits both domestically and in the international market as well as reduce the costs associated with their emissions. That is the whole basis of the scheme. That is the way the scheme will work. Under Labor's plan, a market based mechanism, companies have the opportunity to make their own decisions about the way that they reduce their emissions and therefore reduce their costs. We are not going to force outcomes on them; we are seeking to allow them to do what companies do best—to make their own decisions about how they reduce their emissions intensity and therefore their costs. That is what will occur under our scheme over time. It is opposed by those opposite, because they do not understand the fundamental nature of the way that this scheme works. It is very difficult for them to grasp the nature of this scheme and how it will work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That became evident when they developed their direct action policy. Through their policy they are saying that they are opposed to the sale of permits, particularly in an international context. Senator Cormann has raised issues in the committee stage today about the opportunities for high polluters to make a transition into the clean energy future and to reduce their costs. One of the ways that they will have the opportunity to do that is to install new technology, make changes to their production methods, and, to offset some of that cost, generate permits and be able to sell those permits on the international market. Under the opposition's plan, that opportunity will not be there for many of these companies. That will mean that their costs will be pushed up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was borne out in the evidence given to Senator Cormann's committee, the Scrutiny of New Taxes Committee, when they conducted an inquiry into the carbon pricing mechanism. I particularly draw the committee's attention to the fact that, whilst that committee was taking evidence, they heard from a number of big players in the domestic electricity sector—most notably, Loy Yang Power, one of the biggest producers and generators of electricity on the eastern seaboard. When they were giving their evidence to the committee, they were asked what it would mean for them, a big producer of electricity and a big emitter, if they were not able to purchase abatement permits on the international market. Their answer was very succinct and very simple. Their answer was that their costs would be pushed up; that their costs would be greater than they otherwise would if they had the opportunity to purchase permits on the international market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is quite symbolic of the fact that those opposite do not understand the way this market based mechanism will work. Companies will be able to make their own decisions about how they reduce their emissions and over time reduce their costs. Indeed, wider than that, across the whole economy, households, businesses, small businesses, larger companies and farmers will make their own decisions about how they reduce their emissions over time. So it is nonsensical and quite amusing that those opposite seek to come into this debate at this point in time and criticise the government about the way the scheme will work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition's direct action scheme is anything but a market based mechanism. It is a scheme that will be based upon the premise of subsidising the biggest polluters in our country—providing government assistance to those who are the biggest polluters—and for the rest of the economy, those who do not receive assistance, there is no incentive for the reduction of emissions over time. So those who are doing the right thing will be penalised under the opposition's scheme if they are not able to access that assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the premise on which the opposition's scheme is based is highly dubious. The claim that 85 million tonnes of abatement will be achieve through soil carbon is something that many experts in this field say is a dubious claim—most notably, the Farmers Federation. The Farmers Federation have said that they do not believe that that level of abatement will be able to be achieved under the opposition's scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there is also the issue of ongoing uncertainty, particularly in the National Electricity Market, associated with the opposition's scheme. If the coalition roll back the carbon pricing mechanism, the fact that we would not have a domestic carbon price and would not be contributing in terms of an international carbon market would add to the uncertainty that would be ongoing in one of the most important industries and sectors in our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not for me to make these claims; these claims have been made by serious players in this industry and by their associations. The Energy Supply Association of Australia have said that Mr Abbott's warning not to purchase permits will put pressure on electricity prices and consumers. Again, that is a fact that came through in the evidence of Loy Yang Power. It will push up costs, because those opposite are opposing the notion of trading permits. The National Generators Forum have said that Mr Abbott's approach would increase the risk for electricity generation contracts, which would fuel higher prices. A number of banking organisations that work in the industry have said the same thing. So what we would see if the coalition's plan were implemented would be ongoing uncertainty and increases in prices—not only on the wholesale market but also for consumers ongoing—and we would not achieve the levels of abatement that we need to achieve as an economy and as a society to ensure that we are rolling back our emissions intensity over time compared to baseline objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, once again, I find it highly amusing that Senator Cormann and others are seeking to criticise the government's package when it comes to a move to a clean energy future and important assistance that will ensure that companies, small businesses, households and consumers can make that transition to a clean energy future—because they are funda­mental to that transition. Once again it demonstrates that those opposite fail to understand and grasp the notion of a market based mechanism. They are seeking to reward those that are the highest polluters in our economy whilst providing no incentive other than for those they are seeking to subsidise through their Direct Action Plan, which of course will not provide the impetus for an economy-wide approach to reducing emissions and trading both domestically and in an international market. It is unfortunate that they seek to waste the committee's time with these issues. I hope that we get some more sensible debate in the remainder of the time allocated to these issues.</span>

I am advised that modelling undertaken for the government in the context of the Treasury modelling did look at Western Australia as well as the NEM. I am advised it did not suggest that Western Australia would be disproportionately affected relative to black coal generators in other states and that there was no reason to discriminate in Western Australian generators' favour on energy security grounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the senator is concerned about energy security, the government is very focused on that, which is why the assistance has been structured in the way it has. It is true that the $5½ billion under the Energy Security Fund does target the most emissions-intensive electricity generators. I have gone through the policy rationale for that. It is important to note that the two other components of assistance under this package—the loans to emissions intensive generators who are unable to secure finance, which is the working capital point, and any other assistance recommended by the Energy Security Council, which might extend to loans or other matters—are not limited to a particular emissions intensity. Whilst the emissions intensity point is relevant in relation to the $5.5 billion, those two other components have a differential policy basis—I will just correct that: I understand that the refinancing loans do have an emissions intensity limit but not the assistance recommended by the Energy Security Council.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  Your answer misses the whole point as far as the impact on power generators in Western Australia is concerned. To compare the impact on black coal fired power generators in Western Australia to the impact on black coal fired power generators in other parts of Australia who are part of the NEM is completely irrelevant. The Western Australian energy market is its own distinct market. In the National Electricity Market you are going to get substitution from one electricity supplier to the other, which you will not be able to get in Western Australia. What matters is the relative impact within the market, not the relative impact in the Western Australian market compared to the relative impact in another market. That might be too complicated for you to grasp this morning, Minister. You have now confirmed that $5.5 billion in assistance and the assistance with any financing arrangements through the transition as a result of the impact of the carbon tax will go to the highest emission intensity electricity generators. The reason why electricity generators like Macquarie Generation, Verve Energy and so on are not getting any transitional assistance—zero, not one cent, not one dime, zilch—is that they are too environmentally efficient. That is why they get no transitional assistance at all.</span>

What is appropriate is for me to outline, as I have done, the basis on which assistance is provided, the basis on which assistance is disbursed between different players in the sector and the policy rationale for that. I have done so and I will continue to do that. But, as I explained to him when he asked the first question, I do not think it is sensible, helpful or appropriate, frankly, for ministers to say company X will get this amount of money.</span>

I have explained to you why $5.5 billion is allocated on the emissions intensity basis and other bases and the reason for that, which is energy security. I have explained to you the additional assistance in terms of the provision of loans. That is referenced at paragraph 6.193. I am happy to read that onto the record for him if he would like, but it is in the explanatory memorandum. I have explained that in addition there is a backstop mechanism whereby the Energy Security Council can recommend additional measures if required for energy security.

The government's Energy Security Fund is designed to reduce energy security risks. It provides assistance to the most emissions intensive generators in the country, wherever they may be. Assistance is targeted in this way because the modelling and expert advice suggests that this is the best way of reducing risk to energy security. The plan also contains other provisions to address residual risk to energy security.</span>

It refers to modelling and expert advice. It does not give a policy rationale. Why is it that in the government's judgment it is appropriate for 100 per cent of the transitional assistance to go to the most emissions-intensive coal fired power generators when the less emissions-intensive coal fired power generators get zero? If it is based on expert advice on energy security matters, why is it that you do not then assess Western Australia as a distinct market, which it is? It is a distinct electricity market. If the question is one of energy security exclusively, then surely the impact of the carbon tax, as far as the Western Australian electricity market is concerned, has to be assessed in isolation and quarantined from the impact on the national electricity market.</span>

But let me just make this observation. Macquarie Genera­tion is at the top of the government's carbon tax hit list, not because it is more polluting than anybody else, not because it has a higher emissions intensity than anybody else but because of the volume of electricity that it generates. It is generating electricity in a way that is more environmentally efficient than a number of other electricity generators. It is generating that electricity in a less emissions-intensive way, and yet this government is going to hit this company with a $540 million tax in year one, going up year after year after year, for its efforts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to do well under this government, you have to make sure that you are more polluting, not less. If you want get the handouts from this government under the merry-go-round of the carbon tax, you have to be a more emissions-intensive electricity generator. If you are an electricity generator that has lower emissions intensity, you will be punished. The reason you will be punished is that you are so successful in providing a large volume of electricity, even though you are providing that large volume of electricity at a lower emissions intensity than other providers in the market. That is just ridiculous. When we asked the minister to give us an explanation as to why that is the case and why the government thinks that is a good way to go about things, all she said was, 'Well, that is our advice.' Okay. But why? The minister's answer is: 'That is our advice; we're not going to give you an explanation as to why we think that we should hit Macquarie Generation with a $540 million tax without transitional assistance whatsoever. You're just the Australian parliament; you're just the Senate. Who cares about giving any explanation to the Senate as to why that is a good idea? Who cares about the impact that's going to have on consumers in New South Wales?'</span>

                    </a>  You have not. Here we go: a $540 million tax with zero transitional assistance. And why? Because their emissions intensity is too low. So, because their emissions intensity is too low, they will not be getting any transitional assistance. And, despite their emissions intensity being too low, they are still top of the list. They are still top of the carbon tax chart. They are still the number one 'polluter'—that is how the Prime Minister talks about them. The Prime Minister talks about 500 polluters. The number one polluter—in the language of the Prime Minister—is Macquarie Generation. They are the top of the charts. They are going to be number one on Labor's carbon tax hit list, paying $540 million of tax with zero transitional assistance. Now we are told that the reason they are getting zero transitional assistance is that they are too environ­mentally efficient. If they were less environmentally efficient—if their carbon intensity were higher—we are told that the Gillard Labor government would be providing them with assistance. Instead, they are going to face the full brunt. And electricity consumers in New South Wales will face the full brunt of this, Senator Thistlethwaite, either as consumers or as taxpayers in the state of New South Wales.</span>

All the minister glibly says is, 'I refer to my previous answer.' And the previous answer was a nonanswer; the previous answer was a description of what is in the legislation, not an explanation as to why. Then we had the glib comment that that is the expert advice. Minister, you should be prepared to tell us in your own words—in the government's own words—as to why you think it appropriate for zero transitional assistance to go to a power generator that is responsible for 40 per cent of the energy supply of New South Wales and that is going to be hit with a $540 million tax. I am not holding my breath. I suspect that you have not got an answer to that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, Minister, this is just another example that demonstrates the absolutely ludicrous nature of this carbon tax, which will push up the cost of everything, make Australia less competitive internationally, make more polluting businesses in other parts of the world more competitive and help more polluting businesses in places like China take market share away from busi­nesses in Australia. That in turn will shift emissions from Australia to other parts of the world, which will cost jobs in Australia and result in lower real wages. Prices will go up. That will result in Australia having a smaller economy than we otherwise would have had. And all of that without doing anything to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. We are imposing all of this cost and sacrifice on all Australians, including electricity consu­mers in New South Wales, for no purpose whatsoever. And you are not even prepared to provide a proper explanation in the chamber of the rationale for it.</span>

                    </a>  On super, to be fair to him, he has had a consistent position. It is just that he got rolled. In August 2007, he said, 'The government's recent announce­ment of a national emissions trading scheme is a positive and sensible approach to addressing global warming.' So in August 2007, Senator Cormann—when Prime Minister Howard was in power—supported an emissions trading scheme and supported the price on carbon that he now says is a tax on everything. And he also supported the part of the policy of the then Prime Minister that the emissions trading scheme would be introduced ahead of other nations. Let us keep things in perspective when we hear the continual diatribe from Senator Cormann.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to a number of the issues raised, if the senator cared about giving an incentive for cleaner energy generation and investment in cleaner energy generation he would support a price on carbon, because what a price on carbon does is give people an incentive to abate—that is, to reduce pollution. It also gives investors an incentive to invest in clean energy. If the senator cared about incentives for clean energy generation, he would not worry about the argument over who is getting handouts; rather, he would support a price on carbon to give people an incentive to pollute less and investors an incentive to invest in clean energy. The fact that he does not demonstrates that he is not being principled in his approach to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point that I would make on handouts is this: one of the most bizarre things in this whole debate is that the Labor Party is arguing for a price signal and a market mechanism and the Liberal Party are asking for taxpayer handouts. It is fantastic, isn't it? The Liberal Party, who are supposed to be the rational economists in this place—but they certainly have not demonstrated that under Tony Abbott at any point—are arguing for taxpayer funded handouts for polluters. If Senator Cormann is worried about handouts he ought to go into his party room and argue against their direct action policy, which is the government taxing Australian households to give money to polluters on a wing and a prayer and a hope that they might reduce their pollution. With respect, Senator—and I know there is a lot of rhetoric in this place—I have outlined very clearly that the rationale behind the fund is the mitigation of energy security risks as Australia transitions from highly emissions-intensive sources of generation to more renewable and low-intensity sources. That is why we have the Energy Security Fund and the measures I have outlined. I have also explained to you that that is the rationale behind the emissions-intensity basis of the allocation of one component of the assistance, which is the $5½ billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the impact on households, we have been completely transparent about that. We have not only done the Treasury modelling previously; we have done it subsequently—and what that shows is that you are looking at a CPI impact of around 0.7 per cent in 2012-13. On average that is $3.30 per week, about 10 per cent on electricity prices. We recognise that, and that is why we are providing a reduction in people's income tax arrangements. We are increasing the tax-free threshold. That is why we are providing an increase in the pension payment—in the age pension, in the disability support pension—and also assist­ance through the family tax system. So we have not hidden the price impact, Senator; we have accounted for it and we are providing assistance which is particularly focused on low-income Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I invite the opposition to move their amendment. I certainly invite Senator Xenophon, who has come back at this stage, to get to his amendments, because he has quite a number and as yet we have not dealt with any of them. I appreciate he has asked some questions about one amendment which he is considering his position on. I understand he flagged that, but I would certainly invite him to consider moving his amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I have a few brief remarks. Just to make the point again: what the government is introducing is a massive new tax, a massive new bureaucracy and, of course, a merry-go-round of money. For the government to try and tell us that a massive new tax, a massive new bureaucracy and a merry-go-round of money is somehow a market based mechanism beggars belief.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister tries again to perpetuate this myth that somehow there has been an inconsistency in approach. Let me just again place on record, very succinctly, that the world and Australia's national interest since August 2007—when it comes to action on climate change and when it comes to Australia's contribution to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions—have changed.</span>

                    </a>  Could I finish. The challenge of climate change is still there to be addressed, but we actually have to make a judgment on whether what is on the table is going to make a positive difference or whether it is going to make things worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is the crux of the argument: in 2007 there was a general expectation that countries like the US and others would introduce cap-and-trade emissions-trading schemes. There was a general expectation that there would be an appropriately compre­hensive global framework around pricing emissions agreed to in Copenhagen—and, of course, Copenhagen was a complete failure. And you need not go any further than the assessment of then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as to what his views were about the success or failure of the Copenhagen conference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All throughout 2008, 2009 and 2010 we had the Garnaut review report; we had the government's green paper and white paper; we had a number of parliamentary inquiries; and we have a clear public understanding, and the understanding in this parliament, of what a price on carbon in Australia would do in the absence of an improvement in an appropriately comprehensive global agree­ment to price emissions. All throughout 2008, 2009 and 2010, in the context of a lot of public debate, in the context of a lot of discussion, Senate inquiries and House of Representatives inquiries and policy debates within the various parties, there clearly was an increased and improved understanding of what a price on carbon in Australia in the absence of a price on carbon imposed by most of our trade competitors would (1) do to Australia's national interests, in terms of the impact on our economy, on jobs, on costs of living, and (2) have on the impact on global emissions. Of course, the conclusion after those processes all throughout 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was that, in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement to price emissions, that in the absence of countries like the US and others deciding to price emissions in their countries through an emissions trading scheme or carbon tax, it was not in Australia's national interest to impose a price on carbon outside of such a framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at all of the comments on the public record, whether from me or others, all throughout 2008, all throughout 2009, all throughout 2010, you will find that our position in 2008-09 was that we should not make a judgment on Australia's decision on a carbon pricing regime before Copenhagen. Indeed, the position when Malcolm Turnbull was our leader was 'not before Copenhagen'. Our position was that, if the government was going to put this legislation to a vote before Copenhagen, we would vote against it—and indeed we did. We voted against the government's legislation—together with the Greens, I might add. The Greens were sitting there right next to us voting against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, initially in the House of Representatives in late June 2009 and then in the Senate on 13 August 2009. I remember the day well! We voted against the Carbon Pollution Reduction scheme—that is, the coalition, Senator Xenophon, Senator Fielding and the Greens. We all voted against it because we all shared the view that what the government put on the table was not effective action on climate change. It was a scheme which, in the coalition's judgment, was just going to push up the cost of everything, cost jobs and put Australia under pressure without doing anything to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. And of course, the Australian people are entitled to believe that after a lot of backwards and forwards, after a lot of toing and froing, our Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, came to the same conclusion—because not only did Prime Minister Gillard tell then Prime Minister Rudd to kill the CPRS, not only did she tell him not to go ahead with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme; she also, of course, went to the last election with the most emphatic promise of them all, with the most emphatic promise any Prime Minister could ever make, when, looking the Australian people straight in the eye, through the barrel of a camera, in that memorable Channel 10 moment, in the morning, five days out from the election, she said to the Australian people:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason she said that is that no doubt at that point in time Prime Minister Gillard, like the rest of us, realised that it was not in our national interest to impose a carbon tax in Australia when our trade competitors in other parts of the world were not doing the same. All we are doing is making higher-emitting businesses in other parts of the world more competitive than even the most environmentally efficient equivalent businesses in Australia. That is what the debate is all about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Minister Wong, you can come in here and quote from my first speech as much as you like, but you know very well that the world has changed over the past four years. You know very well that the debate on Australia's national interests, in the context of carbon pricing, has changed.</span>

                    </a>  I will take that interjection because this is at the core of the Labor-Greens lie. You want people to believe that your tax is going to do something to improve the environment. It will not. You are painting this picture of how we have disastrous prospects of rising sea levels, floods, droughts and this and that. But your tax is not going to do a thing to stop a single flood, a single drought or to stop sea levels from rising. In fact, arguably, your tax will make it worse to the extent that it will make environmentally efficient businesses in Australia less competitive than more-pollut­ing businesses in places like China and encourage the shifting of economic activity from Australia to other parts of the world. You have reduced economic activity in Australia—and your Treasury modelling assumes that economic activity in Australia will be lower than it would be without a carbon tax—but you will have shifted it to other parts in the world where the same level of economic activity will result in higher emissions. So, the world is no better off. That is what this is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Your government, Senator Thistlethwaite, wants to make Australian businesses less competitive so that higher-emitting business­es in other parts of the world can take market share away from them. Your carbon tax aims to reduce emissions—no, it will not reduce emissions; they will continue to go up—compared to what they would have been without a carbon tax in a way that increases emissions, arguably by more, in other parts of the world. What is the sense of that? There is no sense in it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this is a legitimate thing for us to assess is that we are not alone in this world. Look at what is happening in other parts of the world. Canada has just said that there is no way they are going to go down this path. The US has made it very clear that there is no way they are going to have a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. And I do not believe that Barack Obama would go back on his word in the same way that Prime Minister Gillard has. I am prepared to give you a guarantee that Barack Obama is not going to put emissions trading scheme legislation forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me address another Labor-Greens lie. The minister keeps coming in here and saying: 'Well, China is making all these efforts. China is doing so much better than anybody thinks they are.' That is just not true. It is a complete fabrication. You do not need to look any further than the govern­ment's own modelling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude on the point I was making before the minister rudely interrupted me. The minister wants us to believe that somehow China is making huge efforts to reduce emissions. Back in 2008, only three years ago, the government thought that by 2020 emissions of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> in China would go up to 16.1 billion tonnes. Do you know what figure the government now thinks CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions will go to in China in 2020? It will be 17.9 billion tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span>. So, over the past three years there has been a deteriora­tion to the tune of 1.8 billion tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> in the government's expectation of what will happen in China with CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions. That figure is three times the total volume of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions in Australia, which puts into perspective what we are talking about here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is all spin. There is no honest policy and there is no honest factual information; it is all spin. The government comes in here and says that China is making all these efforts, when over the past three years its expectation of what will happen in China by 2020 has deteriorated—it has gone backwards. The government's expectation of what will happen with CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions in China is now worse than it was three years ago, whereas Australia continues to meet its commitments under the Kyoto protocol—whether it was the Howard government or the current government. We are doing our bit. We are doing what we committed to do. So don't give us all of this false rhetoric, Minister. Give us some facts.</span>

But I want to make a couple of points because the exhortation is to deal with facts. The facts are that it will cost us more as an economy and as a community to act later rather than earlier on climate change. The facts are that the government's policy will cost the economy, households and business less than the opposition's policy. The facts are that the science in the last few years has got worse. If you read the updates to the settled science—and I invite those opposite to read the work of Professor Steffen and publications earlier this year—what they tell us is that the window of opportunity is even narrower than it was when we first presented the CPRS. The facts are that those opposite like to talk about other countries in an attempt to say to people in this chamber and elsewhere, 'Don't worry about the risk to the next generation, don't worry about the fact that it might be a good thing to shift from being a very highly polluting economy, let's just say no.' Those are the facts that Senator Cormann and his colleagues do not wish to face. I again suggest, Madam Temporary Chair, that it would be a good thing if we could deal with some of the amendments before the chair.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  Just a few questions, and I will not take much time of the chamber. One of my concerns is abattoirs. In one of our hearings for the Senate Select Committee on Scrutiny of New Taxes at Tamworth, Bindaree Beef, an abattoir in Inverell, the town I live in, estimates the cost to be $1.74 billion in the first year. Just a couple of points here. The Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program provides a total of $150 million over six years. Minister, I am sure you are aware of that. This is just $25 million per year, but Bindaree Beef's budget to introduce systems will cost about $30 million. Refrigeration is the largest energy user on any meat processing plant and contributes around 65 per cent of electricity use at Bindaree Beef. They anticipate an annual increase of electricity costs to around $4.8 million from $3.2 million by 2012-13.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the concern I have: this whole program compensates houses and pensioners, but it also affects our business sector. The minister was just saying, in response to Senator Cormann, what the rest of the world is doing. These costs are not going on abattoirs in America which businesses such as Bindaree Beef have to compete against. They do not have those costs. What can be done about helping these industries that are vital to regional Australia and rural Australia, and people in the cities also eat meat? What are you going to do? The $150 million package over six years, just $25 million a year for the whole abattoir industry, is simply not enough. It will not achieve the change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">JBS, commonly known as Swift, has an abattoir near Ipswich—$3.3 million a year is their cost with emissions and the cost of electricity. Minister, could you inform me: what you are going to do to help these businesses survive? The $150 million you have proposed over the six years simply will not do anything and the criteria for the industry mentions:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">establishing a new production facility, green-field production site, or a facility for a new product which does not replace an existing site.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So a lot of your so-called compensation package does not relate to abattoirs; they will not be able to receive any of that package. Minister, what are you going to do to see that these jobs remain in our abattoirs? Just two weeks ago we had the abattoir at Grafton close and some 120 jobs have gone. What are you going to do to see that these abattoirs survive with this extra cost on their production?</span>

We might want to come back to that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am advised that the Treasury modelling shows that under a carbon price meat product manufacturing is in fact estimated to grow by 12 per cent to 2020 and by some 137 per cent to 2050. I am also advised that most meat processing facilities are likely to fall below the coverage thresholds of the scheme and hence not be directly liable. It is the case that there is dedicated support of some $150 million for the food and beverage processing industry available under the Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program. This sets aside dedicated funds to support the industry to invest in technology or processes to reduce their emissions. The government will also establish a $40 million energy efficiency information guidance program which will help industry peak bodies, including those that support the meat industry, prepare and disseminate informa­tion for their members on how to improve their energy efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the senator would know, households are also provided with assistance to cover any increase in cost of consumer goods in the form of the household assistance package to which I have referred previously. To keep this in perspective, the additional Treasury modelling released in September 2011 estimates the carbon price will have an impact of about 0.4 per cent on the consumer price of beef, equating to about 10c a week. I certainly heard your comment about Bindaree Beef. I am advised that officials from DCCEE, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, have also visited a number of sites, including to Bindaree Beef, to explain the program and either are presenting or have presented at a meat industry workshop in recent times or shortly. My briefing says shortly, but I understand that has already been done.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  My third and final question to the minister is: what compensation will there be for local government? During our Senate inquiry, we heard that Tamworth Regional Council would pay an extra $300,000 for electricity alone. The reports are that there will be a five per cent increase in the cost of road building. In New South Wales we have rate pegging. Last year the rates were pegged at 2.8 per cent. That does not include water, sewerage and other charges. In Inverell Shire Council, for example, their rates went up around $250,000 in income this year, brought about by rate pegging of 2.8 per cent, controlled by the state government, and their wage bill has gone up some $450,000. Now they face an increase in electricity and in road building. With their rubbish dumps, what are their rubbish emissions? Do they come under the 25,000 tonnes when they group together the emissions out of all their rubbish dumps? What is the compensation to local government? That is my third and final question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I take you back to that constitutional item. How does the government wangle its way around the Constitution, which is above this parliament? The minister agrees that in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales those coal fired generators are properties of the state. That is who they belong to. They might be in the name of Macquarie Generation or various other names, but they are properties of the state, and the Constitution clearly says you cannot impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a state. So those are my two questions. Firstly, how do you get around the Constitution under this proposed carbon tax? I think it is against the Constitution. I think it is in breach of the Constitution. Secondly, what is going to happen to local govern­ment? These are the last two questions I will be asking, Chair, because I know time is of the essence and Senator Birmingham has a quick question before we get into amend­ments from Senator Xenophon, I think.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole problem with this tax is that you are going to strangle the business sector. One day, over that side of parliament, you will realise where our nation's wealth is derived from. It is the business sector that employs people, pays tax and gives money to governments, which you then use to give out pensions and provide services and hospitals and aged-care facilities. You are going to compensate low-income families and pensioners, but you are doing nothing for abattoirs competing in the world market. We know what it is going to do the cement industry. We have already had two factories close in the last 12 months. The first was in Rockhampton. Now they have announced the closure of the factory in Kandos, where I think 96 people are directly employed plus all the businesses and the truckies and those that hang off and rely on that industry. This is where you have got it so wrong. You are strangling business, the very sector that drives our nation's wealth. You strangle our business sector, you strangle our economy and you strangle our nation financially. You might be able to compensate people, and that might shore up your votes if the compensation is 20c a week more than the cost is going to be, but here is the problem: you are going to put the costs onto local government and our industries competing overseas, and I question whether this is simply in breach of the Australian Constitution.</span>

                    </a>  Senator, let me go through this. I listened to you in silence. Most businesses will pass on the price, and that is why there is assistance being provided to households—to reflect the 0.7 per cent CPI increase, which I must say is significantly less than the price impact of the GST when it was introduced. There are businesses who cannot pass on the price. Businesses in what I used to call the emissions-intensive trade exposed sector—I do not know if we still use that term—are provided with a very substantial amount of assistance. I think it is $9.2 billion over the forward estimates under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program directly to deal with those issues. If the senator cared about business costs, he would care about two things: he would care about the fact that he is imposing a higher cost to achieve the same environmental outcomes through his policy—</span>

                    </a>  I will take the interjection that that is wrong. He is basically telling the Treasury and the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency—apolitical public servants—that their advice is wrong and that he, Senator Williams, the National Party senator for New South Wales, is right. You are imposing higher costs on businesses through your policy, including your refusal to allow international trading. You would not do that if you did care about costs on businesses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point on that I make is that you would support the MRRT because that actually will provide a tax cut to companies and small business.

                    </a>  I am going to come to those questions. I am just responding to the point on the business sector. In relation to section 114, the government's advice is that the provisions do not contravene that provision of the Constitution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to local government, as I said, the impact, which includes the impact on council rates, is 0.7 per cent of CPI. You might recall that the GST introduction was a 2.5 per cent CPI increase. The government provides ongoing financial support to local government through the financial assistance grants. That is a pool of funding indexed to the CPI, so obviously that indexation of itself captures the carbon price impact.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A question on landfill was raised with me. Landfill operators who take action to reduce pollution from waste before 2012 can secure carbon credits under the Carbon Farming Initiative. If landfill operators use methane from landfill to generate electricity, they may be eligible for renewable energy certificates under the Renewable Energy Target. I am advised that legacy waste emissions are excluded from any liability and, therefore, it is expected that carbon farming credits from landfill waste will in fact exceed liability on landfills in the period to 2020.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also made some changes in the other place to landfill liability to further ease the burden on local councils. There will no longer be a liability on landfills that emit between 10,000 and 25000 tonnes. Landfill operators will be able to meet 100 per cent of their obligations using carbon farming credits. Regrettably, Senator, I think your party opposed those amend­ments. The Australian Local Government Association welcomed the outcome of this and the introduction of a market based approach to carbon pricing. They said:</span>

I want clarification from the minister or an extension to an answer that she gave me earlier today. The clarification relates to the issues we were exploring about the budget impact. I think in response to a question of Senator Cormann the minister made a statement regarding when the budget accounts for permits for a future vintage year that are purchased in advance. She said that they are accounted for in the year in which they are acquitted. I am assuming she is meaning the year in which the permit is acquitted, in the vintage year of the permit. Minister, could you clarify for me, so we are absolutely clear in terms of the fiscal impact and the underlying cash balance impact, where that money is treated within the budget tables.</span>

So we and anyone who chooses to look at the tables and the impact can have a crystal clear understanding: permits with a vintage date of 2015-16 that are purchased in 2013-14 do not appear in the government revenue for the fiscal impact tables but are of course taken into account in 2013-14 for the cash balance impact; is that correct?</span>

I am happy for Senator Birmingham to do that, but there is one preliminary issue before we deal with that amendment. It is a seminal issue that I think was touched on last Thursday night. Under the CPRS, under the legislation introduced by the Rudd government, there was a clear target of five per cent reduction in greenhouse gases based on 2000 levels. Whilst this legislation does not have any specified target, can the government confirm that it is the intention of this bill to achieve the same outcome of a five per cent reduction on 2000 levels, or will a greater amount or a lesser amount be achieved? This is not a trick question. It is a genuine question to establish whether what we are going for is the same target as that in the CPRS.</span>

One is in relation to the deferred payments issue that we have been debating here this morning. I am now really confused about where the coalition stands in relation to this matter. I understand that what Senator Xenophon was talking about was a concern about the working capital burden that a carbon price imposes on the energy sector in terms of buying the permits upfront and having that investment. Generators are saying they will need to hold $4 billion worth of permits in any one current year and a further $6 billion worth of units to support forward contracting. They were asking for deferred settlement arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have talked about the fact that they do have a three-year certainty and so on, so the matter has been dealt with. We will have to wait until we see the practice to see whether these concerns are exaggerated. I have taken those up with the government. But clearly what the Energy Supply Association has said is that if they cannot afford a contract then the market, in their belief, would be more volatile, the electricity market would be more expensive and prices would be higher for consumers. So what we have, as I understand it, is the coalition saying that they will not honour any forward permits. They have come out and said that. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, has come out and said that electricity generators ought not buy any forward permits because the coalition will not honour them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By the same logic and argument, therefore, the coalition is saying that they want more volatility in the electricity supply market. They want to have greater expenses for the electricity market and they want to have much higher electricity prices for consumers because they want to deny generators the capacity to purchase into the forward market. That is as I understand it at the moment, so I find it interesting that Senator Birmingham is standing here trying to suggest he has some concerns about the provisions of the legislation relating to the settlement arrangements under the auction provisions when it is the coalition's policy to actually prevent any banking of permits and any projection into the forward market. In fact, AGL came out in the joint committee and said that the coalition's position represented a billion-dollar dead weight on the Australian economy because it drives up the cost of capital in the next few years because of the level of risk the coalition is driving into the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought it was important to clarify here with the coalition attempting to show some concern about the energy supply sector's supposed concerns about their ability to forward contract. If any group of people is undermining a forward contract market and driving up electricity prices and volatility in the market, it is the coalition. It is another reason why I believe we are going to see yet another retreat from the coalition. We will see them back off and not repeal these bills—in the event that they ever did come into government—because business will not tolerate it. Business wants certainty. Business wants the ability to forward contract, to hedge against risk, to even out its supply over time and its working capital arrangements. It wants those certainties, and the coalition is intent on taking those certainties away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So business is going to start to wind up, as we saw them do when the International Monetary Fund came up for discussion last week, when even the Business Council of Australia came out. Even the Business Council, which has supported the coalition to the hilt up until now, came out last week saying that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, was completely wrong on this and that it would be a breach of Australia's global responsibility and reputation to behave in the way that the coalition was suggesting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the idea that what the coalition says in here stands, at the very time we had the coalition in here talking about why ARENA and CFEC were such bad ideas—'such a honey pot for the white-shoe brigade', to quote Mr Robb—in the lower house we had Mr Macfarlane saying that, not only would the coalition not oppose ARENA, contrary to the blood oath, in fact they would not repeal it either. They are not even opposing it, let alone repealing it. So in relation to the emissions trading part of this scheme we will see the coalition not repeal these bills if ever they get the chance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we are going to find business winding up very strongly on the coalition on economic credentials. We saw it over the weekend with the embarrassing situation for Senator Cormann where nobody told him the coalition was going to make a massive retreat on superannuation. He was busy up here with the superannuation industry, telling them there was absolutely no way they were going to honour the nine to 12 per cent. There was every certainty they would be repealing that, and then when you turn round twice there is a phone link-up based on what the politics demand and Senator Cormann is left hung out to dry. So already we have had the coalition in the Senate hung out to dry by expedience from coalition members in the lower house.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I thought it was important to get some clarity around the issue of working capital arrangements for generators, future contract­ing and cash flows. I want to put on the record that the Greens did take this seriously through the joint house committee. We have looked at the submission from the Energy Supply Association. We have recognised that ACIL Tasman did that modelling for them. We have seen how ACIL Tasman can be very various according to whomever has asked for the modelling. I noted that in particular in relation to other aspects of this carbon price. I want to look very carefully at what does happen on the forward contract­ing, but I am of the view now, as is the government, that the three-year period gives people a clear indication of where things are going on pricing and will give them a clear collar, if you like, once flexible pricing starts. I think it is important in this context to have that on the record.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  Isn't it remarkable that, just as I get to utter the words 'I move' and then yield to Senator Xenophon, who asks a sensible question, Senator Milne—who has come into this debate at various intervals and said, 'Why aren't the coalition moving amendments?' and 'Why aren't there sensible questions being asked?'—comes in and goes off on a tangential rant! Is it any wonder then, Senator Milne, that I am going to respond? I am going to respond because you came in here and asked us to respond and talk about a whole range of other issues which were not the subjects of the debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can see that Senator Milne is frustrated by this debate, as are the Greens. It is evident that, whenever Senator Milne sits down in her chair, she wants to bounce up and answer the questions instead of allowing the minister to do so. She is desperate to be the minister responding to questions about this package because, of course, she was so integral to its development. Senator Milne was sitting around the multi-party committee table designing and developing the package. Whilst Senator Wong, admirably, knows much of the detail of this package and handles it with aplomb much of the time in the chamber, Senator Milne is nonetheless the frustrated author of this package, and she wants to get to her feet herself and make sure that she has her say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Milne has the gall to attack the opposition for a lack of amendments, even though our position on this legislation has been crystal clear: we oppose it. My question for Senator Milne is: where are the Greens amendments? If you want to question where the opposition amendments are, I ask you: where are the amendments from the Australian Greens? There is not a single one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Milne, do you contend that this package is perfect? Do you contend that it meets all of the designs that the Australian Greens would have liked to have had in it? Does it achieve everything that you chest-thumped over during the CPRS debates—all the things which Senator Wong well knows the Australian Greens needed to have in the CPRS but which you do not have in this package? You did not have the courage then to talk to Senator Wong, and you were not willing to negotiate with Senator Wong at all when she was the minister on the CPRS package, so, now that you have negotiated something, it does not achieve half of the things you talked about during those CPRS debates. It does not go anywhere close to achieving the things that you wanted at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, even though you love to come in here and attack me, attack changes in opposition positions and attack a lack of opposition amendments, the Greens are just as guilty as any other political party in this place for the way that the politics of this matter have been handled over many years. You come in here and talk about the electricity generation industry and how they are treated and say, 'The Greens took this matter seriously during the joint select committee, and we looked at closely.' But I have here in my hand the Greens contribution to the joint select committee's report. It is a sole paragraph which does not mention the electricity generation sector once! That is the Greens consideration of the matter, so do not come in here moralising, hectoring and lecturing all of us. We have heard plenty of that from the Greens time and time again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the frustration of the Greens. It is sometimes hard to tell, looking across the chamber, who is the biggest captive of whom. The Greens have had to sell out a lot of the things they demanded in order to be able to sign up to this package, and in doing so they have not even said to the govern­ment, 'We reserve the right to move a few amendments of the things that we didn't get during a multi-party committee stage.' You could have done that, Senator Milne. You could have said, 'We'll support this, but, at least in the chamber debate, we'll move some of the amendments of the things that we have said are important.' But, no—you backed down on all of that and did a fully fixed deal with the government. Senator Xenophon could move the most worthy and most sensible amendment in the world, and the Greens would not consider supporting it. It could be an amendment that most aligned with the things that the Greens used to talk about during the CPRS debates, and still they would not support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do not come in here, Senator Milne, and lecture everybody else about things, because frankly the position the Greens have taken on this debate sells out many of the things that you used to talk about in the debates on the CPRS. You know it and Senator Wong knows it, because she had to sit through all of those debates and hear you speaking about them time and time again. Whilst often on this side we talk about the government's having to yield to the Greens to put this package up and so back down on Prime Minister Gillard's promise at the last election that there would be no carbon tax, it is equally true that the government have managed to persuade the Greens into supporting a package which was not previously in line with Greens policy and does not go towards achieving it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been having a sensible discussion in this chamber at times this morning about the impacts on and the concerns of the electricity generation industry. Senator Xenophon has been asking some questions on that, I have been asking some questions on that and other senators have touched on different aspects of that. You have not been in here asking any of those questions, Senator Milne, so do not come in and lecture us now. I note that there was a question from Senator Xenophon before you spoke, Senator Milne. It went to the issue of what the target is, and I think the minister was about to get to her feet to answer when you, Senator Milne, interrupted the chain of the debate. I invite the minister, if she remembers Senator Xenophon's question, to answer it. If she does not remember it, I am sure Senator Xenophon will happily ask it again before we proceed the amendments.</span>

If I do not do well enough I am sure you will come back at me. I think the question was whether the government remains committed to the five per cent target—the relation between that and the bill, essentially. The government's unconditional commitment—and the opposition's, as I understand it—remains the five per cent, and the fixed-price period and the default caps in the legislation are consistent with that unconditional target.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  I will follow on from that, but can I first say this. Senator Milne and I have our disagreements but I think we have a pretty constructive working relationship. We might have fundamental policy disagreements. I do not think it is fair to criticise Senator Milne for a lack of participation in the debate, which I do not think is quite right anyway when she participated very fully in the committee—a committee that I could not get on because of the way the numbers were. I do not think anyone in this chamber, whatever side of the debate they are on, could ever accuse Senator Milne of not participating fully and very vigorously in this debate. That is a fair thing to say which I think is a pretty apolitical statement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the minister's answer, what I am trying to work out is this: five per cent was the target under the CPRS—a five per cent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 based on 2000 levels. The minister has said, as I understand it, that this bill does not resile from the government's position of a five per cent reduction in greenhouse gases based on the 2000 levels. Does it mean that this bill, in its form, in the scheme design that has been presented to us, could lead to a greater reduction than five per cent on 2000 levels by 2020? I am just trying to see whether this bill is an improvement on the CPRS in terms of its scheme design.</span>

The bill also sets up the Climate Change Authority, which would provide advice on that. My recollection is that any revision to caps would be by way of disallowable instrument, so obviously there is also parliamentary oversight of the executive's decision, which would be taken subject to the advice of the authority.</span>

So, if there are specific questions of me, perhaps we should deal with them and then it might be sensible for Senator Birmingham to move his amendment, which would enable at least that discussion to occur in my absence which might be fairer on Senator Lundy and the chamber.</span>

In relation to the structure of the scheme, it means that the target of five per cent is flexible. It is a disallowable instrument. I am not taking issue with that in itself, but what I am trying to understand is this: if that is what the government is saying, that you could vary the target—presumably upwards not down­wards, I take it; you cannot vary the target downwards by disallowable instrument, can you?</span>

I know that is the government's position, but does it mean that another government with a different position could simply say, by disallowable instrument, 'We will reduce the target to one per cent,' or 'to zero per cent'? It is not a cute question; it is not a trick question. I just want to establish that. Assuming that the answer to that is no, the other issue in terms of increasing the target is: if the government says that one of the reasons we need to have this scheme in place is to give certainty, won't there be a degree of uncertainty if the target can be moved by way of a disallowable instrument? That is the flipside of that question.</span>

What has been set up here, which goes to Senator Xenophon's question about what a future government might do, is a climate change authority which is independent and which, if you look at the requirements in the legislation for what the climate authority has to do, has to take into account the latest science. It has to take into account how effectively the current legislation, whatever it might be at that time, is working, in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And it has to set out a trajectory to meet the scientific imperative. It has to have regard to the government's target, and the target that has been set down by this government is an 80 per cent reduction by 2050. The Climate Change Authority, having regard to the latest science and the govern­ment's 80 per cent trajectory, will set down, for the first five years of the scheme, emissions reductions per year that are consistent with that objective. In my view, a climate change authority that is taking into account the latest science will be setting down a trajectory that is much more ambitious than would constitute a five per cent reduction. In fact, we would hope that this climate authority, taking into account the latest science and what needs to happen by 2050, will be setting a quite substantial trajectory in those five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How it will then work is the Climate Change Authority will provide its report to the government of the day about what that trajectory will be and what those emission reductions will be per year. Having taken that into account, the government of the day will then make a recommendation to the parliament by way of a regulation—and that regulation will be disallowable. In the event that the parliament of the day determines that it does not support whatever the recommend­ation of the government it will disallow that instrument. Obviously, what Australians would not want to see is a situation where there was no reduction target in place in such a circumstance—and not only people concerned about climate change; all those businesses that have established on the basis of ongoing reductions and have a business plan associated with that want to have some certainty. So the default position in the event that a parliament disallowed is for a five per cent equivalent reduction target expressed in tonnage. So whatever the Climate Change Authority recommends goes to government and the government then puts to the parliament a regulation and the regulation can be disallowed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the scenario—which I think is the one Senator Xenophon may have been referring to—where a climate change authority may make a recommendation to a government and a government may decide that it is not prepared to give effect to that climate authority recommendation. The recommendation will become public and it will be up to the government of the day to justify to the community and to the parliament why it is making a recommend­ation that is contrary to what the Climate Change Authority may have recommended. It will be up to the government of the day to make that case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no way that you could see a professional climate change authority, based on its mandate to take account of the latest science, would be recommending a trajectory on a yearly basis that would take us back to a lesser target than the ones that it had recommended previously, because the ones it had recommended previously go to that trajectory. So it would only be in a situation where a Climate Change Authority's recom­mendation to a government was rejected by that government and that government decided to put in a regulation that gave effect to a much lesser ambition in terms of greenhouse gas reduction. It would then depend on the parliament and the make-up of the parliament as to whether that instrument was disallowed. In the event that it was disallowed, because it absolutely undermined the emission reduction effort, the five per cent would kick in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless a particular party which was a climate denier and did not support emissions reduction had control of both houses of parliament, it is difficult to see a scenario where such a low ambition represented in a regulation would actually be accepted by a parliament and not disallowed. So I think Senator Xenophon's concern about the reduction is not something that we could see expressed—certainly for the foreseeable future, because of the make-up of the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in terms of the question as to whether the trajectory can be higher than the five per cent, it absolutely can be higher than the five per cent, because that climate authority is tasked with recognising the climate change impact, and we would certainly be expecting that the trajectory of emission reduction in the first five years and then annually thereafter would be consistent with the kind of reduction you need to get to, at least 80 per cent by 2050. Of course, the Greens would be hoping that it would get to net carbon zero by 2050 but, nevertheless, you could expect that trajectory to become steeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, giving the climate authority that independent power is critically important. That is why the Greens are saying that we need to put in place the Climate Change Authority and let the Climate Change Authority understand its mandate, as presented in the legislation, to take into account the latest science and to have regard to all of the other matters in its mandate and then set the trajectories. That is why we do not want meddling with the independence of the climate authority. In the same way, we have said the ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation need to be independent of the politics, they need to be overseen, they need to have the decisions implemented by people who have expertise and who are there for their expertise, and they need to deliver on their mandate, rather than to respond to which electorate may need investment at a certain time on the basis of what polling results might show.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the real strengths of this package is the establishment of a climate change authority to take this into account; the connection with the Productivity Commiss­ion in terms of the Productivity Commission working with the climate authority to assess over time whether the compensation to industry is such that it compromises our ability to meet the targets; and that we have an independent authority set up, with ARENA, and an independent authority, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. These are the real strengths of this particular package, because for the first time you get expertise-based leadership—based on science, economics or investment and finan­ce expertise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Xenophon, I understand where you are coming from, and I can assure you that the Greens thought very carefully about the extent to which a future government might be able to try to undermine what is the strength of this package—and that is upward flexibility in terms of ambition—and I am satisfied that the checks and balances are there.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I thank Senator Milne and note the comprehensive answer that she just gave. It probably does go at least partly to the point I was making before that Senator Milne is desperate to be the minister in this debate. In this instance she gave a good and detailed answer about how the Climate Change Authority will work and about how the targets may be set. I note that she confirmed, in response to Senator Xenophon, the possibility, and it may well be a remote possibility, that the Climate Change Authority could recommend a target below the five per cent target that has been agreed to by all sides. It is an interesting revelation. It is quite possibly a revelation that is not likely to ever come into play, but it is an interesting revelation nonetheless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly note the comments that Senator Milne made at the end of her contribution, when she said that the Greens gave great consideration to the capacity of a future government to change the targets and whether that was a risk within the establishment of the Climate Change Authority, and that they were confident that the way the legislation was structured and the way the authority was structured minimised that risk. That is an area that should be of some concern to individuals. It is all very well to have expert authorities, but we all know that expert authorities do not always get it right. We know there are often circumstances where people expect the government of the day to act. It does seem as if the Greens have deliberately gone about setting up a structure, and have elicited the support of the Labor Party in setting up a structure, that does its best to remove the capacity of the parliament to chart the nation's own destiny, or certainly the capacity of the government. The parliament in the end obviously has the capacity to amend legislation if the support is there in both chambers, but for governments of the day it is noteworthy that the Greens sound like they take it as a source of pride that they have managed to get the Labor Party to structure this in a way that removes the capacity of future governments to make decisions that they think are necessary without significant change to this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a question that relates to this area of targets that we have been examining, which Senator Xenophon put us on. I will ask it and, if the advisors are able to give the parliamentary secretary a clear answer, that is fine. If they are not, I am happy for it to be taken on notice pending the debate resuming later in the day and Senator Wong's return. It relates to clause 17(2). There was a discussion with Senator Joyce late last week about clause 18(2), which is the annual reduction of 12 million units that occurs if there is not agreement to the regulations that are tabled in the parliament. The minister's response then was that the 12 million unit reduction was to achieve a steady reduction towards the five per cent target. In clause 17(2) the default mechanism formula for the initial year is described as total emission numbers for the eligible financial year beginning on 1 July 2012 minus 38 million units. My question is about how that 38 million unit figure is derived. I note that it is not evenly divisible by the 12 million units, so it is not simply a figure that maintains the flat trajectory that the 12 million units per annum does. How did the government come up with the 38 million units and why is that figure seemingly unrelated to the annual step down beyond the fixed price period of 12 million units?</span>

I understand the 12 million is a per annum figure that gives an even trajectory towards the five per cent target. That was the argument Senator Wong put in Thursday's debate. Given that 38 million units obviously is not three lots of 12 million or two lots of 12 million, is it a higher target that has to be met in the initial fixed-price years of the scheme compared with what will be required in the non-fixed-price years of the scheme? If they are able to provide a clear answer there, that would be appreciated.</span>

It is an amendment that both Senator Xenophon and the opposition have circulated in relation to this debate. It is simple because what it seeks to achieve is simply to defer the proclamation of this legislation until the meeting of the next parliament. It seeks to ensure that the Australian people have a say on whether this package of bills comes into law or not. This amendment is put forward mindful of the fact that the Australian public were so willingly, deliberately and clearly misled at the last election. We have heard the words time and time again but, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, just because the reminder of the Prime Minister's commitment at the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led has been repeated time and time again in this place, in the other place and in public debate does not make the Prime Minister's breach of faith, her total backflip on that promise, any less significant.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Evans wants me to put my heart into it. Senator Evans, you and every other senator on that side of the chamber and every Labor member of the House of Representatives went to the last election backing the Prime Minister and her promise. It is possible that Mr Rudd was not backing the Prime Minister as enthusiastically as everybody else, but the rest of you went to the election backing the Prime Minister, who stared down the lens of the camera and uttered those words: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' That is the promise she made. She went to the election on it and she managed to cobble together a government in the weeks after the election, having only just limped over the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite all know that if she had not made that promise, if she had not betrayed the Australian people, if she had not told what has turned out to be a mistruth during the election campaign, they probably would never have limped across the line. They would never have got those votes together. But they cobbled together a government. They did a deal with the Greens and the Prime Minister came out and said, 'Lo and behold, circumstances have changed.' The only circumstances that changed were her desire to occupy the Lodge and the threat that she may not be able to do so unless she did a deal with the Australian Greens. So in the one month we heard the Prime Minister on the one hand saying that we would not have a carbon tax, selling that to the Australian people, and then on the other hand signing a deal with the Australian Greens to say we will have a carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment seeks to right that wrong. This amendment seeks to give the Australian people a chance, a choice and an opportunity to have a say on this policy. We can go to an election and give the Labor Party the chance stand for their principles and fight for what they are now attempting to legislate. This is an invitation to the government and an opportunity to go to an election and say, 'We believe in this, we are genuine about this and we will stake our position in government on this.' That, after all, is what the Howard government did in regard to the GST package. Former Prime Minister John Howard went to an election in 1998 and gave the Australian people a choice before bringing fundamental reform into this parliament. Your government has done the exact opposite. You went to the election promising one thing and then did the exact opposite afterwards, giving the Australian people absolutely no choice whatsoever.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of consistency between those two examples is seen right through every stage of the debate. I have highlighted that in this place before in relation to the committee examination of this legislation. It is like chalk and cheese. For the GST we had multiple committees undertaking multiple examinations of the legislation over a period of five months. Here we had one hastily convened committee controlled by the government and the Greens that only had a couple of weeks to examine the matter. In this chamber today we see a vastly different situation occurring. When the GST was debated in this chamber the committee stage lasted for 51 hours and 32 minutes. How much time do you think we have for the committee stage this time around? We will be lucky to have 30 hours. We will be lucky to have half the amount of time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government proclaims the carbon tax is a bigger reform than the new tax system was. They claim this is even bigger. They certainly acknowledge it has economy-wide implications, and yet they will not provide the same amount of time for its debate in this place. At every opportunity they run away from debate. They run away from the oppor­tunity for the Australian people to have their say. This amendment is their opportunity to have a say, the government's opportunity to put it to the Australian people and to have the courage of their convictions, to let their government rise or fall on this matter.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  As a co-mover of this amendment, I come to this from a different perspective. I do not believe that the Prime Minister lied to Australians when she said just before the last election that there would not be a carbon tax under a government that she led, but I believe that she changed her mind. She changed her position because of the exigencies of minority government. There is a fundamental principle here: if you tell the people on such a key issue, an issue that could have been an election changer, that you are not going to do a particular thing but then change your mind after the election for whatever reason, I believe it is incumbent on you to go back to the Australian people on that issue. I supported a plebiscite. I do not support the view that there was some deliberate lying or misleading of the electorate. But it was a fundamental mistake for the government to say one thing before the election and then after the election, because of different circumstances, say, 'We will plough ahead with this regardless.' That is dangerous. That is fundamentally wrong. It is an issue that can only be resolved if this package of legislation is passed subject to the safety valve of it not being given effect until after the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My position is consistent. Thirteen years ago in the South Australian parliament I voted against the then Olsen Liberal government's moves to privatise electricity assets. They went to the people at the 1997 state election in South Australia saying they would not privatise the assets. They changed their mind a few months later, and my position is the same. It is entirely consistent with the view I have had for virtually all of the time I have been involved in parliaments. Do not promise not to do something and then change your mind without going back to the people first. That is why there is such deep cynicism about politicians and the political process—because they change their minds without going back to the people to get the necessary mandate in order to deal with an issue that will be fundamental to this economy. It is a fundamental issue of democracy. We should not proceed further with this bill unless we have this amendment in place.</span>

Given those facts, how then can the Gillard government stand by its claim that the world's biggest carbon tax will be good for Australia?</span>

It is entitled to hold that position, but it is important to recall the context of this. In the government's view, the report released by MCA on the impact of carbon pricing on the Australian economy significantly overstates the costs of carbon pricing. The modelling is driven by unrealistic restrictive assumptions on international carbon trading. This is why the carbon price projected by the modelling is higher than Treasury projections. For example, the analysis projects that the carbon price will be significantly higher in 2020 than the Treasury modelling, $36.10—and this is in 2010 dollars—in 2016, growing to $43 in 2020. That compares with the Treasury modelling of $24.60 in 2016, rising to $29.40 by 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The MCA assumed that international action is restricted by lower demand for carbon permits due to lower international ambition. The assumption is also made that sources of relatively cheap supply are disallowed from international carbon trading. This contradicts reality, as relatively cheap internationally tradeable abatement is already being generated through the Clean Development Mechanism and this is set to expand. To assume that this abatement is no longer available, as the modelling does, simply ignores reality and therefore creates modelling that significantly overstates the impact of a carbon price.</span>

Isn't it the case that the government's heroic assumptions about its carbon tax rest on there being a global carbon price and international emissions trading in place by 2016? Given that the congress of the United States recently voted against participating in Europe's trading scheme, Canada's foreign minister has said that his nation would never, ever introduce an ETS and the Japanese government has dismissed calls for a new global deal by 2015, why is the government irresponsibly rushing ahead without any meaningful international support?</span>

Senator Cormann knows that, but he is too embarrassed to stick his head up in this question time. The 2016 that is referenced is not consistent with the medium global action scenario, which is the scenario relevant to the package that is before the chamber. The medium global action scenario incorporates the low-end pledges until 2020 by nations. In this scenario, developed regions, China, South Africa and OPEC enter the multistage approach from 2021. India, Indonesia and other South and East Asian nations enter in 2026 and the rest of the world's regions enter in 2031. The 2016 date that is being utilised by the opposition in relation to this is incorrect.</span>

Given that the authors of the report, the Centre for International Economics, are yet another of the long list of experts to reject the Gillard government's wildly optimistic assumptions about global action on climate change, how can the minister justify imposing on the people of Australia a carbon tax with an impact, reach and scope far more severe than the carbon tax of any other country in the world?</span>

We have the best scientists in Australia, the people at the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. We have the best economists in Australia, those in the Australian Treasury. We have the best advice on this issue—the same advice that was given to Mr Howard—which is that if you delay action it will cost you more. The science is clearly demonstrating the imperative for action, and in fact the situation is getting worse. That is why no credible economist supports the opposition's plan, which imposes more costs on the Australian economy, more costs on Australian business and more costs on Australian households to achieve what they say is the same environmental target. The reality is that there is no credible policy on that side of the chamber on this. Mr Turnbull knows that and Mr Hewson knows that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Senator Brown and the rest of the Senate would be aware that the Prime Minister has made a visit to Afghanistan in the last day or so, as a sign of our ongoing commitment to democracy in Afghanistan, but also in order to reinforce to the Australian troops deployed in Afghanistan the support of the Australian government, and I think the support of all Australian people, for their mission there and appreciation of their efforts.</span>

He would be aware the Minister for Defence provided an update on Afghanistan to the parliament on 13 October, and in particular the importance of ensuring the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area did not become a safe haven for terrorists. The government has made it clear it will not be in Afghanistan forever and that we are on-track to transition to Afghanistan-led responsibility for security arrangements in Oruzgan province in 2014. In July this year Afghanistan and the international community welcomed the formal start of that transition process, in the first tranche of provinces and districts across Afghanistan. This marked an important step towards meeting President Karzai's objective that Afghan authorities assume lead security responsibilities across Afghanistan by the end of 2014. President Karzai is expected to announce the second tranche of districts and provinces for transition later this month. We remain committed to doing our best in Afghanistan— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:13</span>):  I thank Senator Singh for her question. Thanks to the Labor government's leadership, Australia has a very strong budget position—and this, of course, is a great strength during a time of global turbulence. But the government has made it very clear for some time that global instability will inevitably have an impact on our economy and on our budget. On Friday the Reserve Bank showed the weakness in the global economy was affecting our economy, with downgrades to its growth forecasts. Today, a report from Deloitte Access Economics shows how the budget revenues have taken a hit as a result of global pressures. The global instability is also impacting on confidence in the economy. It is making consumers more cautious and businesses more hesitant to hire, and all of that of course has an impact on our budget. But, despite the instability, the government remains determined to return to surplus in 2011-13 as planned. We understand that there is work to be done to ensure we meet this target, and the revenue downgrades caused by the global turbulence will make the job of returning us to surplus in 2012-13 more difficult. But we are determined to get there. This means we need to make further budget savings. The government is working towards putting together the mid-year budget update, which it will release before the end of the year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now more than ever a disciplined fiscal approach is absolutely critical. We have seen how the markets punished countries that do not have the same level of fiscal discipline as Australia. This government is delivering the fastest fiscal consolidation on record and through this we are providing more room for the RBA to cut rates if the global situation deteriorates further. The IMF, the RBA and global rating agencies continue to back the strength of our budget position and our strategy to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13, well ahead of our international competitors.</span>

We understand that there are many Australians who do not feel they are sharing in the direct benefits of the mining boom. We also remember how many people from the resource rich states felt they had been left with little long-lasting benefit from the last boom.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's minerals resource rent tax is a historic economic reform that will spread the benefits of the mining boom to all Australians, no matter where they live and work. The benefits will include a $1 billion tax break for Australia's 2.7 million small-business operators and a boost in the super guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent for around 8.4 million workers—I under­stand that this became bipartisan today, so that is a good thing. Also, there will be $1 billion of investment in new roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure. Australians know how important the mining industry is, but they also know that they are our resources and we should share in the profits. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer the minister to a report in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> that Coogee Chemicals, which operates Australia's only methanol factory, which is in the Prime Minister's electorate of Lalor in western Melbourne, is planning to shelve its proposed $1 billion world-class expansion due to the direct impost of the Gillard government's carbon tax, potentially costing 150 jobs and exports worth $14 billion. Hasn't the Prime Minister now not only betrayed Australian voters, but also her own constituents, by going back on her word that there would be no carbon tax under the government she leads?</span>

I would point out to the minister that that question is being asked now because of a lack of an answer earlier. Also, no part of the answer provided in the committee stage addresses the point raised by the company about increasing future costs. Given that Coogee Chemicals has spent 16 years developing the best technologies and have the lowest carbon dioxide emissions per tonne of any methanol plant in the world, isn't the threat of increasing costs in the future just another example of how the government's carbon tax is driving up emissions and not reducing them?</span>

If the company is in fact significantly more efficient than the industry average on which the permits are allocated, on the basis of the information provided to the government the company is likely to be entitled to more than 100 per cent of its carbon liability in the form of free carbon permits. I do not know how many times I can give the same answer to that question. It is an obvious proposition. What we know is that the coalition will not allow the facts to get in the way of any aspect of the scare campaign, which I notice is petering out a bit. It has been interesting, hasn't it? It was a blood oath and now we see a bit of moving around in the coalition's position— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Tonight's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> looks at the threats to the Great Barrier Reef from coal and coal seam gas ports, including those in Gladstone harbour. The Gladstone environ­mental disaster has seen vast numbers of turtles, dugongs and fish die and a three-week suspension of fishing in the harbour—all after two million cubic metres of dredging has occurred of the 46 million that has been approved by the minister. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has expressed extreme concerns about the dredging and has said that it would have an unacceptable impact on marine life and the World Heritage area. The minister's response was to impose water quality conditions, but dredging has had to be suspended three times already when turbidity has gone off the charts in breach of those conditions. Last Friday levels of heavy metals also breached federal water quality guidelines. When will the federal government suspend its approval for this largest ever dredging in the World Heritage area and act to protect the Great Barrier Reef?</span>

As she has noted, a three-week temporary fishing banned was imposed in Gladstone harbour and it was lifted on 6 October. The ban was imposed by Fisheries Queensland while tests were cond­ucted to assess reports of an infection outbre­ak in barramundi and other fish species. Water quality analysis and fish testing have confirmed that fish in Gladstone harbour are not a food safety or human health issue. Health issues reported by commercial fishermen have been investi­gated. No links were found to the fish disease or to water quality. Water quality testing has shown little change other than seasonal variation in water quality since dredging began.</span>

In June, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee also expressed extreme concern about the impacts of the LNG export facilities in Gladstone and said that they may be jeopardising the World Heritage status of the reef. They called for a strategic assessment of all coastal development. The federal government says that this will not happen for another two years and that it will take about three years to complete, but nothing—no approval or application—will be suspended in that time. Minister, what will be left to assess in five years time when there are already at least six major port developments planned or underway?</span>

UNESCO's World Heritage Committee rebuked the federal government for failing to notify it of the approvals for those LNG projects in Gladstone Harbour in advance. But it is not just Gladstone Harbour; there is a litany of new coal ports proposed up and down the reef which will entail millions and millions of cubic metres of dredging. Has the federal government notified UNESCO of the cumulative figures of dredging and offshore dumping up and down the coast in the World Heritage area, and if not why not?</span>

We held a view that nine per cent was not enough, and we have announced an increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, which is to be phased in gradually over six years. The government have always been very clear about how this would be funded: at least part of the funds from the minerals resource rent tax would pay for this and other very import­ant superannuation reforms. I might point out that a 30-year-old will be able to retire with an extra $108,000 in superannuation. </span>

However, they have now changed their minds. As of Friday, the Liberal Party has changed its mind. Increasing compulsory superannuation is no longer going to wreck the Australian economy, it is no longer going to decrease real wages and it is no longer going to ruin small business. They have decided to support Labor's policy to increase compulsory superannuation.

We are cutting the tax on 3.2 million Australians' superannuation contribution—the contribu­tions tax. We are cutting tax for small business. All of this is going to be funded, like the increase in the superannuation guarantee, from the mining tax, which the Liberal Party still say no to. What we have today is a Liberal Party 'no' to the mining tax, but they have changed their mind on the super guarantee.</span>

You will see in those, Senator, and I think we were discussing them in the chamber, both the impact on the UCB and the fiscal balance. I am happy to read them all out if you want. This is inclusive of government measures, because we of course have separately costed those which were the MPCCC measures. The fiscal impact, which is table 3, is 4,424 over the forwards—that is, 2,940, 1,061, 1,607 and 938 over the forward estimate period. The UCB impact—this is the MPCCC plus government measures—is 2,907, 558, 701 and then a positive 32, which is a total impact of 4,134. They are in table 3 and table 4 of the fiscal tables in the EM.</span>

If Labor is unable to bring in a new $9 billion a year tax without actually increasing the budget deficit over the forward estimates by more than $4 billion and is equally unable to say when in the future it may cease to run a deficit, why should Australians believe that Labor has any hope of recording a budget surplus anytime soon?</span>

I have had good discussions with my state counterparts in relation to land use planning, particularly on what the Commonwealth is doing to facilitate consistency in relation to coal seam gas developments. Everyone in this place knows that coal seam gas regulation is largely a state responsibility. The Minister for Resources and Energy, Mr Martin Ferguson, is seeking to facilitate an agreement-best practice approach to regulating the industry across all states and territories. This is a significant policy issue which must be considered carefully and the Gillard government continues to put all energy into this process. With the Commonwealth facilitating the states and territories, they have agreed to work cooperatively covering the following areas: (1) coexistence between agriculture and mining, (2) developing a national regulatory best practice framework focusing on well integrity, including hydraulic fracturing and chemical use and (3) water management and monitoring. These discussions will be progressed at the Energy and Resources Ministers' Meeting in early December this year. It is time for the states and territories to adopt a harmonised framework as a more robust means of ensuring protection of the environment, water and land use. This would provide a consistent set of rules for the future development of the industry. </span>

These projects are subject to around 300 federal conditions relating to water, stipulating that the companies must test and monitor every relevant aquifer to verify whether or not they are hydraulically connected. The environ­ment minister, in granting the approval with conditions, has demanded that companies have to test and monitor every aquifer for connectivity. It is also why the minister has set up an expert scientific panel to assess the company's plan— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer the minister to modelling released today by the Centre for International Economics which shows that, if Australia acts ahead of the world in introducing a carbon tax and the world does not follow, it will have a vastly bigger impact on productivity, wages and the cost of living. When will the government release the modelling of the scenario which would appear to be the most realistic, the situation in which the rest of the world does not match the government's zeal in seeking a tax on carbon dioxide?</span>

                  </a>  In the government's view the report released by the MCA on the impact of the carbon price on the Australian economy significantly overstates the costs to the economy of carbon pricing. I have gone through the reasons, in my answer to Senator Brandis, why that is the case, which include the assumptions around international trade and the assumptions around the carbon price that proceed from those. So I am not really sure—through you, Mr President—how much more assistance I can provide. I could read out precisely the same details that I read out on the previous occasion if the senator really wants, but I think the key issue is that the government does not agree, for the reasons I have outlined previously, with the findings of the modelling commissioned by the Minerals Council. The government stands by the Treasury modelling, which confirms that Australia will continue to enjoy strong economic growth under a carbon price.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, on a point of order: before the minister sits down, the point of order is this. Senator Boswell asked when the government would release its modelling. You know, Mr President, that the minister did not touch on that issue in her answer. She has 44 seconds. She seems to have been bringing her answer to comple­tion. You ought to direct her to address the question she was asked.</span>

If the minister disagrees with the Centre for International Economics modelling, why doesn't she release the assumptions and data for its MMRF and GTEM models, which would allow others to run like-for-like modelling scenarios and subject the government's claim to public scrutiny? What have you got to hide?</span>

                  </a>  I will take that interjection. That is not correct. The assertion from Senator Brandis is that we have not released assumptions. There have been assumptions released. The government has put out some 200, I think, pages of modelling results, including 100 charts, and 350 pages of consultants' reports. The report provides a detailed explanation of assumpt­ions used in the modelling and is, if I may say, much more significant than the modelling which was not done, for example, under the Howard government in relation to water policy. We have been very transparent about the modelling which has been released. I accept that the opposition simply cannot accept the Treasury findings, which are that the economy continues to grow, wages continue to grow, jobs continue to grow and emissions fall against what they would otherwise be— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, I refer to the estimates committee where Mr Glyde said it was impossible to model because there was not sufficient information for a third party to do the modelling. Another part of that was that Ms Quinn said the modelling had not been released before 2007. In view of that fact, there is no chance that anyone has the modelling.

The largest modelling exercise ever undertaken in the country's history was released and then it was updated, and we have released reports and charts and the consultants' reports and a whole range of the assumptions which underpin it. The truth is, Mr President, they want to talk about these issues because they do not want to talk about the fact that the Australian Treasury are advising the same thing that they advised Mr Howard when those opposite were in government: that you can introduce a carbon price and still grow your economy, grow your incomes and grow jobs.</span>

When the Prime Minister attended the University of Wollongong to announce the 12-month construction rollout for the NBN, it was an important day for all of the sites announced but particularly so for the Illawarra region. We saw a major expansion of construction across two sites, in Dapto and Wollongong, which will see nearly 11,000 premises gain access to the NBN fibre services. This is of course in addition to the 5,200 premises where constr­uction is underway in the Kiama township and the Jamberoo area and the 2,500 premises that are now ready for service in the Kiama Downs-Minnamurra region.</span>

The Department's decision to decline or reduce funding was based on a thorough assessment of the project's likelihood of achieving outcomes to successfully rehabilitate prisoners and reduce their likelihood of reoffending. The Department took into account factors including the merits of each applicant's funding submission, past performance and external reviews (where relevant) and competition amongst the applications received.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked today relating to a proposed carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have listened to the minister both in the committee stage and during question time today. The government is determined to have Australians believe that a carbon tax is, firstly, the best thing for our economy. It is also determined to tell us that a carbon tax is in the national interest, that a carbon tax is good for small business, that a carbon tax is great for households, that taking billions of dollars out of the Australian economy will help it grow and that giving billions of dollars to overseas countries for carbon credits is a good thing for our economy. This government has but one talent, but one capacity, and that is to say precisely the opposite of what in fact is the truth. All of those things are untrue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of honesty and integrity in this carbon tax flows from the very words by which it has had its genesis: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' This is the most notorious and dishonest statement ever heard in Australian politics. It sits right alongside 'We will have a regional processing centre in East Timor' and 'We will have a regional processing centre in Manus Island.' Economic forecast after economic forecast from this government has been completely and utterly false. Another is 'There will be a budget surplus in 2012-13.' Already the Treasurer, after having committed to it, is back-pedalling on this. This government has not delivered a surplus budget, and Labor governments have not delivered a surplus budget for more than 20 years. The minister has just fobbed off every single question—and I heard some very good questions today, including during question time—about particular industries. The minister stood and said, 'The government's modelling shows the Australian economy will continue to grow.' This is not about the individual industries that are devastated by this tax. This glib global statement is one that the minister has stuck to through thick and through thin. The meat industry question from Senator Williamson was very, very good. That industry is going to be devastated, and the minister just said, 'Oh, the government's modelling shows that this economy will continue to grow.' This is the fraud. This is the deception. This is the lack of honesty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the minister will fight to the last breath not to disclose the assumptions upon which this crazy modelling has determined that the economy will continue to grow. Confronted with Minerals Council modelling, she said with an almost disdainful tone in her voice, 'Oh, that's Minerals Council modelling,' as if to say that they are all deniers and heretics and they should be crucified shortly. This minister is seeking to put through something that she knows is not good for the economy and is a huge fraud on the Australian public. One need go no further than her immortal words in 2009, when she said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The introduction of a carbon price ahead of effective international action can lead to perverse incentives for such industries to relocate or source production offshore ... </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are her words. She continues: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... there is no point in imposing a carbon price domestically which results in emissions and production transferring internationally for no environmental gain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the minister speaking. Yet she comes in here today with a completely flip-flop perspective. Her credibility is less than zero. She stands over there telling us homily after homily, lecturing us until the cows come home that this is good for us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She herself has said that this is a shocking tax, that a price on carbon is going to kill jobs and kill our economy, and that it will just send all our manufacturing industries overseas—where they do not have such a crazy government with such a crazy policy. She said that, and she believed it at the time. What has happened? What has happened is that she has got into bed, as her government has, with the crazies at the end of this chamber—the Greens. That is what happened.</span>

We had Senator Cormann assuring Phillip Coorey only last Friday that there was no way that the Liberals would not be reversing superannuation. When Mr Robb found out about this, it was of course the end of that policy. I can see that you are laughing, Mr Acting Deputy President, because it is funny. And it is funny that Senator Johnston would even raise the question of credibility. What we know is credible is what Senator Wong was saying about this government's progressive policies in relation to—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I appreciate that protection from Senator Cash. What was senator Wong talking about today? She was talking about the importance of this government's policies with respect to pricing pollution. One of the great misconceptions, particularly as outlined by Senator Johnston, is that other countries are not going down the track of pricing pollution. The reality is that 90 countries representing over 80 per cent of global emissions and over 90 per cent of the global economy have made pledges to tackle climate change. It is true, as we saw last week in Europe, that other countries recognise the fact that Australia is leading in respect of dealing with the issue of pollution. But the reality is that a whole host of other countries accept, as this government does, that we must act on climate pollution. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I rise to also take note of answers given by Senator Wong at question time today to questions asked by coalition senators, regarding the carbon tax. Just how typical it is of the Labor Party that, when they are asked for comments regarding job losses—in my own home state of Victoria, in the western suburbs, a particular region of socioeconomic disadvantage—they go straight to criticising Work Choices instead of dealing with the reality of the legislation in front of us this week that will lead to job losses. Where will the 150 workers who were mentioned during question time go so that they can pay their mortgages today, this week, this year? Where are the green jobs, not in five years time but today? Where are the training programs that will reskill these workers who are losing their jobs now, as a result of the uncertainty brought about by this clean energy legislation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of job losses, I would like to mention an industry in our nation that is a significant employer: the dairy industry—40,000 jobs nationwide in the dairy industry, an industry that is particularly energy intensive and will be significantly impacted by the imposition of a carbon tax and the subsequent increase in electricity prices. This is despite agriculture not being directly taxed, as said in one of the many documents I have here as a result of our work this week, <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ecuring a clean energy future</span>. The modelling that is publicly available, including the assumptions used for calculations by the dairy industry, has indicated that individual dairy farmers will see an increase of $6,000 per annum in their electricity costs. That is not to mention the flow-on effects for milk processors, transport after 2014 and even fridges, because that milk eventually goes down the supply chain and ends up in people's fridges, adding to the costs that householders will be subjected to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about the fridges holding the milk that will be subject to increased electricity prices, if we go to figure 8.2 on page 84 of <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ecuring a clean energy future</span>, we can see that the data on household emissions is based on household emissions in 2007. As the note below the figure says of the data:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… based on 2007 household emissions (the latest year for which the necessary detailed data are available).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are modelling all of this on data from 2007, which is the most recent data available—that is, four years ago. There are decisions being made on data that is so old. My comment would be: how are we going to monitor the success of this legislation in reducing emissions of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> and in changing households' behaviour so that we can move forward to real action, in the long term, on climate change if we do not know how to collect the data, if we do not have the mechanisms in place to understand how much electricity households use day in, day out? How can we model it if we cannot get our hands on the data? This government answers questions by providing assumptions based on modelling of data that we cannot use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to refer to a comment Senator Farrell made earlier. He said that 90 countries, representing over 80 per cent of global emissions and over 90 per cent of the global economy, have made a pledge to reduce those emissions. But none of them are taking the type of drastic action on climate change that this government is. None of those 90 countries has decided to impose a tax that will significantly damage their nation's economy—and why would they, in the current fiscal climate at the global level? Why would you damage your competitive advantage, particularly when you are a resource-intensive economy like Australia? Why would you risk losing your jobs and your exports for no environmental gain? I think that those 90 countries that Senator Farrell mentioned have not done so because they know how ridiculous this carbon tax is as a policy response to climate change. As we have said time and again, no matter how much paper has been used, no matter how many trees have been felled, in order to produce the legislation that we are considering this week, nothing will make this a good tax or a good response to climate change.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  Senator Penny Wong has provided a huge number of responses—I cannot recall how many—to questions on this issue, whether it be in the numerous question times we have had on this issue or in the time in committee recently on the package of clean energy bills. As ongoing as this has become, it is clear that every time the opposition do not hear the answer they want to hear—that is, an answer that fits into their negative agenda on climate change—they choose to pretend that it is just not the right answer, that it is not an answer that equates with or fits their agenda. This is the farcical situation we find ourselves in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong, the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, has provided detailed answers that are evidence based. She has referred, for example, to Professor Will Steffen, one of the climate commissioners who have provided a lot of detail on the science and why we are acting on this issue. The director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, he is peer reviewed and highly respected in the science community and has provided a lot of detail to the government and the multi-party committee that has brought us to the position of having the clean energy package before us. I met with him on 15 December here in Parliament House about the Holocene, which we live in, and the one trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide that is of human origin in the atmosphere today—the one trillion tonnes that Australia is going to play its part in ensuring we do not continue to produce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we doing that? Why are we here today debating the fact that we need to act on climate change? We are not necessarily doing it for ourselves. We are doing it for our children, for the next generation. We are doing it to ensure that we leave this planet with a much better make-up than it currently has and to ensure that the next generation live in a climate that is not going to be volatile and to the detriment of their lives and the environment in which they live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition can continue to ask the questions to which they do not get the answers which suit them: the negative answers they are looking for so that they can go out and bag something that is really good. And this is really good; it is not only providing a lot of support to transition ourselves to a clean energy future with a clean energy economy but also providing tax relief to Australians. Of course they do not want to go into that part of it and have to say, when and if they repeal it, whether they would repeal the tax-free threshold of $18,000 that has been offered to Australians. We know their backflip position now on superannuation. </span>

                  </a>  We know that you will repeal the MRRT, but of course you want to keep the superannuation increase and you somehow have to come up with $12.6 billion to fund it. I do not know how you are going to do that, adding to the $70 billion black hole you have already created. So there are all these things you are going to have to fund that are unfunded. Australians are being left in complete doubt as to how, if you were in government, you would deliver the superannuation increase and how you would deliver a rise in the tax-free threshold to $18,000 now that you are saying you will commit to the superannuation increase but will repeal the minerals resource rent tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opposition here who continued to oppose everything, to run scare campaigns, to backflip on policy, and to come into this place and try to pinpoint Senator Penny Wong for answering numerous questions on climate change. And all the while we know that there are those in the opposition who do not even believe in climate change and those who have backflipped so many times like Senator Cormann, who thought in 2007 that it was a positive and sensible approach to have an emissions trading scheme and yet today has backflipped on that principled position. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BUSHBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  I greatly enjoyed some of the contributions this afternoon but less so some of the others. The coalition senators made thoughtful, considered contributions, where they actually examined and considered the issues related to the questions that were asked during question time of Minister Wong, the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. However, as usual, the government senators reverted to their typical approach of obfuscation and diversion from the facts and the real issues, which are the failings of the government's plan to introduce a carbon tax and the fact that it simply will not work in delivering the environmental outcomes that they say it will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Farrell also noted that there were 90 countries taking action, although he seemed a bit confused at the time—it might have been 90 per cent of emissions or 90 countries. The fact is that none of those 90 countries are taking any action in terms of putting a price on carbon that goes anywhere near being as broad or as deep as what we are doing in this country. No nationwide carbon tax or carbon-pricing schemes have been introduced in any of the 90 countries. I recall that Minister Wong used the term 'a shadow price' on carbon for what she was talking about. The reality is that the vast majority of those countries taking action on carbon are doing the very sorts of things the coalition is proposing to do in its direct action plan: taking action that puts what Senator Wong herself called a shadow price on carbon by using measures that are not a blatant and overt tax on carbon or an emissions trading scheme. So I think the government argument in pointing out these 90 countries is a little disingenuous because all it does is prove that alternatives like what the coalition is proposing in its direct action plan are actually being employed elsewhere and are actually acknowledged by the government as being a legitimate way of addressing the issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Singh mentioned that Senator Wong had provided numerous responses to questions. I think she carefully used the word 'responses' because, quite clearly, Senator Wong does not actually provide answers to questions and 'responses' is a very clever way of saying that. Of course Senator Singh has a lot to hide when it comes to this issue because she is a classic example of someone who would not be in this place were it not for the carbon tax promise followed by the backflip later on which proved it to have been a mistruth. Speaking as a senator from Tasmania, as is Senator Singh, I can say there is no way that the Labor Party would have won that third Senate spot in Tasmania—</span>

                  </a>  Exactly—had the Prime Minister not gone to the people of Tasmania and said, hand on heart, two or three days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' If she had not said that in the lead-up to the election, Tasmanians would have voted with their feet, the Labor Party would not have received the votes needed to get that third Senate spot and Senator Singh would still be the failed minister, the dumped Labor member for Denison, that she was in Tasmania following the last state election, in which she could not even hold onto her seat. We have also heard today, in response to questions, about Coogee Chemicals, which is a Victorian company that was looking to make a $1 billion investment in methanol production in Australia. That has now been cancelled for the specific reason that the carbon tax is going to make them uncompetitive and they cannot do it. This comes at a loss of $14 billion of predicted exports and 150 jobs, but that is not the worst of it. Obviously it is a terrible thing that 150 people are not going to have jobs that they otherwise would have had and there will be $14 billion worth of exports that will not happen. But the fact is that Coogee Chemicals is the most efficient manufacturer of methanol in the world in terms of the emissions that it produces per output of production. So every single unit of methanol that is not produced by Coogee Chemicals and is produced by someone else—and remember that this is the only methanol producer in Australia, so all other methanol will be produced outside Australia—will be at higher emissions per unit of output than it would have been if it had been produced in Australia. So not only are we exporting the jobs of manufacturing that methanol, not only are we losing the export opportunities in respect of that methanol, but by putting in place this tax we are contributing towards a net increase in carbon dioxide and equivalent emissions as a direct result of a carbon tax that is going to drive this investment offshore.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  The Gillard government's wilful betrayal of the ALP's solemn promise of no carbon tax is a matter worthy of discussion, as suggested by the acting Manager of Opposition Business, Senator Bernardi. This gross breach, in lock step with the Australian Greens, is something that one would never have suspected of the once proud ALP—a once proud ALP that has now become a light green shadow of its former self. Along the way it has betrayed its base of manufacturing workers, miners, forestry workers, agricultural workers and those on low incomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the coalition say, and the Australian people are now understanding, that the Australian Labor Party have sold themselves out to the Australian Greens agenda, extreme as it is. That is why their fundamental prom­ise of no carbon tax was breached by the Prime Minister and the Australian Labor Party. Why? It was because the Australian Greens demanded it of them and the ALP followed suit. That is why Labor in this place were willing to move the gag in relation to the carbon tax debate. Indeed, the fact that we are having the motions put as of 11 o'clock tomorrow was not something that the <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">Leader of the Government in the Senate </span>told the opposition as a matter of courtesy. It is was some­thing that we read on the Greens website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens having determined what should occur, the Labor Leader of the House then rang the coalition to advise what the Labor Party would be doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Com­mittee? The Greens say they want another chair, in breach of all of the agreements and understandings in this place. What does the Labor Party do? They say, 'You betcha; we'll support you,' and the Greens are given another chair on a committee in this Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the media inquiry? That was something that was never on the Australian Labor Party's agenda, but after Senator Bob Brown got needled a bit—after he was questioned a bit—in relation to his ongoing duplicity and double standards, all of a sudden there was a need for a media inquiry. And the hapless Australian Labor Party, in breach of all its previous understandings and promises in this area, just went meekly along.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the intergovernmental agree­ment on forestry in our home state of Tasmania, where, at a public rally that I was able to address with Senator Richard Colbeck, we also had trade union officials of the Australian Workers Union and the AMWU standing side by side with the coalition condemning the Australian Labor Party's stance in this area? Why has the Australian Labor Party sold out the forestry industry in Tasmania and, I might add, elsewhere? Because the Greens are setting the agenda for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why were MPs in the other place asked to survey their electorates about the issue of gay marriage? The Greens said so, so the Labor Party voted for it and agreed to survey their electorates on this burning issue of gay marriage! On the question of carbon tax, the government said, 'Do not ask the electorate about that.' Who should form government, the coalition or Labor? The government said, 'Do not ask your electorates about that, because we are scared of what the answers might be.' But because the Australian Greens have a particular policy position in relation to gay marriage the Labor Party meekly went along with that question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why have we seen the unravelling of the border protection policies that worked so well? That is because of the Green agenda, which the Australian Labor Party has adopted. Albeit now they are trying to product-differentiate themselves, I simply say it is a bit too little too late in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did this parliament submit to a week-long debate on Afghanistan? The Australian Greens demanded it so the Labor Party went along with it. Why were live exports from Australia banned? Because the Greens dema­nded it. Cabinet determined their position without the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry putting a submission to the cabinet and without the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade putting a submission to the cabinet. It was just at the behest of the Australian Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So those who used to be the loyal supporters of the Australian Labor Party are asking themselves some fundamental quest­ions. Where is the Labor Party that used to represent their interests on issues like keeping the cost of living down, job security, border protection and the freedom of the press—the sorts of things that people genuinely care about? On the issue of the cost of living, the people are going to get a carbon tax which Labor faithfully promised would not be imposed—a carbon tax which will increase everybody's energy bills, by 10 per cent for power and nine per cent in relation to gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of job security and jobs for the future, today we have heard that Coogee Chemicals, who were willing to invest $1 billion in Australia, in the cleanest methanol plant to be built anywhere in the world, creating 150 jobs and providing $14 billion of export revenue—a great opportunity for the workers of this country—have now shelved the project because of Labor's tax. That facility is now going to be built in China, where the carbon footprint will be four times worse than it was going to be in Australia. So that is bad environmentally, bad economically and bad for jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Labor's heartland is asking the question: why is this so? Why is our cost of living being increased? Why are job security and new jobs being thrown out the window? The simple answer is that the Australian Labor Party—once a proud party—has sold its soul. The Australian Labor Party has sold everything over to the Australian Greens for them to determine and to dictate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I dare say the carbon tax is the worst example because it will have the greatest impact. And the Labor Party cannot shy away from it, because it was Adam Bandt, the member for Melbourne, who said, when he walked into Ms Gillard's office, 'If you want our vote in the parliament, we want a price on carbon; we want a carbon tax.' As a result, Ms Gillard broke that solemn promise. And everybody accepts and acknowledges that she would not be Prime Minister of this great country today if she had told the Australian people that she would have a carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, if this carbon tax is such a great idea, as all those opposite keep telling us, why didn't they go to the last election promising a carbon tax? Surely it would have been a great winner for them! Surely it would have given them a majority beyond all expectations! They knew the Australian people did not want a carbon tax . That is why they promised no carbon tax.  That is why, when challenged about whether they were serious about no carbon tax, they said that those asserting otherwise were being 'hysterical'. That was the word used by the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. So the faithful within the Labor Party voted Labor in at the last election under a false premise, under a dishonest assertion, and it is something which many of them now regret.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And here we have the Australian Labor Party thinking about changing its leader, and doing all sorts of weird and wonderful things. But do you know the problem with the Australian Labor Party? It is not their leader. It is their policy. It is their platform. It is the fact that they have sold out to the Australian Greens. They have a formal alliance. By it, they got into government, and I fear they will be thrown from government because of it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I think senators should ask themselves this question: why would the opposition propose a matter of public importance on an issue which is currently the subject of a committee stage debate in this chamber? Why take an hour from the detailed consideration of the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills, particularly as the Senate is debating this package of bills under time constraints agreed to by the Senate last week? Is it unfair to draw the conclusion that the opposition is either unwilling or unable to examine the detail of this exceptionally important legislation in the Committee of the Whole? After all, we are now debating just the first of 37 amendments that have been moved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose the opposition thinks: why turn up the opportunity for some more negative politics? Why be constructive when you can be destructive? Why talk about the great challenge of climate change to Australia's environment and economy and what we should do about it when you can spend an hour or so bagging your political opponents? Why talk about the actions that responsible governments around the world must take to minimise the impact of global warming when you can take the easier path of just slagging those you do not agree with in the Senate chamber?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a particular responsibility, in my view, to act on climate change. Australia is heavily dependent on carbon based fuel for the supply of electricity, and, as a result, we are the highest per capita greenhouse-gas-emitting OECD country. In fact, per capita, Australian emissions are nearly twice the OECD average and more than four times the world average. We even beat the Ameri­cans—which, I have to say, is saying something! So, yes, it is true: the Australian government does support pricing carbon emissions in Australia and the government encourages the development of clean energy. The truth is we need to take action on climate change, and we need to do it now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the World Meteorological Organisation, last year was the warmest on record globally since instruments were first used systematically to make such measures in the 1880s. Nine of the 10 hottest years in history have occurred in the last 13 years. The CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology report that the last decade —from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2009—was the warm­est ever in Australia. Not only was the last decade the warmest decade on record but the number of record hot days has been increas­ing every decade for the past 50 years and the number of record cold days has been decreasing. The science shows that south-eastern Australia is getting less rain and is getting drier. The drying of south-eastern Australia is of great concern because this is, obviously, where most Australians live and, as every senator knows, it is where most of our food comes from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The warming planet affects not only air and soil temperature but also water tempera­ture. We know that the warming of the oceans is melting polar ice caps, melting glaciers and causing sea levels to rise. An enormous mass of ice, more than four times larger than Lord Howe Island, broke off Greenland last year and slipped into the sea. Sea levels rose by around 10 centimetres from 1920 to 2000, measured by monitoring stations around the Australian coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>fourth assessment report finds: 'Warming of the climate system is unequivocal.' This is an authoritative study by 3,000 of the very best scientific experts in the world. These are scientists who do not use the word 'unequivocal' lightly. What the reports from the IPCC and those of our own scientists at the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology show is that the climate is warming. It will continue to do so as a result of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow unabated, the problem will get worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The science of climate change, of course, has been endorsed by every national academy of science of every major country on the planet, every major professional scientific society related to the study of global warming, and almost—not quite but almost—every climate scientist. The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear: sea levels are rising and coastlines are shrinking. The science is telling us that Australia is warming; the science is telling us that the world is warming. Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response. Climate change is real and is being caused by human activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an overwhelming case for sensible precautionary action to limit the impacts of climate change. Precautionary actions that encourage energy efficiency, encourage businesses and households to switch to clean energy, and encourage the development of sustainable energy supplies are all measures the Australian government supports. Only through measures that minimise industry and household use of carbon based fuels will we reduce the impact of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the opposition: the time has come for that political party to end its opposition just for opposition's sake on this issue. It is too important an issue for that to occur. I strongly believe it is in our national interest to act on climate change, it is in the national interest to act with resolve and it is in our national interest to act now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want to say in the few minutes I have—and Senator Milne will be adding to this later—is that it is very easy to get passionate about which party opposes or supports another party in this place, but the thing that is relevant is how well the progress of legislation in the interests of the wider Australian public is going. What we do know is that now well in excess of 120 bills have passed the parliament in a bit over a year that this government has been in place, and that is quite a remarkable record considering the rate of bills that went through the parliament back in even the Howard years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the bills that went through before this parliament came here was the stimulus package, and that kept Australia out of recession; it saved 200,000 Australians' jobs and many small businesses from closure. There was a case of the Greens supporting the Labor initiative—the initiative of Treasurer Swan at the time—after it became clear that this opposition, this Liberal-National Party coalition, was going to oppose the legislation, with all the terrible consequences for business and for jobs in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes it turns around and there are some Greens initiatives that are put forward which are taken up by government—although rarely is it that any of these things come out of the blue and do not have support in parties in varying degrees when their time has come. Senator Bernardi gets excited about that, although not to the point of speaking on his own matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of pieces of legislation which we disagree with the government on. I want to point that out. First of all, there is the minerals super profits tax, which was recommended by Treasury, and the Greens supported it. The government, under the influence of the big mining corporations, has come up with an alternative which is going to fail to recoup $60 billion to $100 billion over the next 10 years. That is that much money that will not be available for schools or hospitals or transport—high-speed rail included—or housing. However, the opposition is going to collect nothing at all. Mr Abbott has made it clear that he would not entertain any sort of tax and in fact would rescind the tax if it were passed. That matter is being dealt with in the House of Representatives at the moment. The Greens have proposed a five per cent tax reduction for small business, because we can fund it—unlike the opposition. We have shown how we would fund that, but that is opposed by the opposition as well as the Labor Party. I asked questions earlier today about the withdrawal of our courageous troops from Afghanistan, as the Netherlands and Canada have withdrawn their troops. That is opposed by the government and it is also opposed by the opposition, although the latest poll shows it has huge popular support in Australia among Greens-inclined voters, Labor voters and Liberal and National voters. I think it is time adequate debate and serious consideration are given to withdrawing our troops from Afghanistan. Here is a situation where Senator Bernardi and the opposition are in lock step with the Labor government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equal marriage, junk food advertising and having a deposit on beverage containers nationally: these are issues where we see the government and the opposition together but the Greens taking the lead. We are proud of taking that lead and we are proud of the input we are having to this parliament. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="e4q" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ADAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance: the Gillard government’s broken pre-election promise not to introduce a carbon tax and their wholesale adoption of the policy agenda of their alliance partners, the Australian Greens. The Greens held their conference in Perth on the weekend. I was quite surprised to see the headlines in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>—'Political payback as Greens go own way' and 'Don't take us for granted, Greens leader tells Labor'. I just wonder if we have a divorce on our hands. This all seems rather strange. What has happened to the alliance?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was quite surprised, Senator Brown, to see that your conference did not allow the media to be there and actually had them locked out. Senator Brown has always called for open discussion and for the media to be involved in most areas, but in Perth we saw a very brief shot of the Greens sitting there and that was that. This really does surprise me. An article written by Amanda O'Brien for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>quotes Senator Brown:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He paid tribute to Julia Gillard for advancing the carbon tax legislation, which is expected to pass the Senate tomorrow, but he reminded the Prime Minister of the role the Greens played.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Hats off to Julia Gillard and her government … but it's there because of the Greens," he said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that says it all. What is happening is a bit confusing. The Greens are really mad because the Labor Party are obviously not going to preference them. So now the Greens are going to have, for the House of Representatives, open preferences for their members because it seems that their alliance partners have really done the dirty on them. Senator Brown talks about this open ticket in a quote from an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian </span>written by Jane Hammond with the heading 'Political payback as Greens go own way':</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"The big parties are going to have to negotiate with people at the local level," Senator Brown said. "Things are going to get a lot more complicated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In reply to this, political analyst David Black from Western Australia said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the implications of the decision would vary from seat to seat and on the order of candidates on the ballot paper but in general Greens preferences tended to flow to Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He said the decision could be seen as an attempt by the Greens to distance themselves publicly from Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again we have lots of balls up in the air as to where it is all going to go. With an election two years away anything could happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also very interested to hear Senator Siewert on the radio championing aged care as the Greens' main policy for the next election. I do wonder what is going to happen to the Greens' death duty policy from the last election, which surprisingly enough was removed from their website the week before the election. The Greens say they are going to help those people who are reaching the twilight years of their lives and looking to pass on their properties and houses to family members, but the impost of the death duties would be pushed onto those families. Things are very mixed up in that respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has lost control of our borders, her own party and her own cabinet. Unfortunately it seems to be Senator Brown who is calling the shots and leading the country. Last night we had the 50th boat arrival of 2011, with 60 people on board. I think that the policy for immigration is very sadly lacking. We have Senator Hanson-Young saying that she feels every refugee who arrives on a boat should be given the privilege of coming to Australia and being let out into the community, that it is their right and that they have had a terrible time, are all very hard done by and should not be locked up until they have had their credentials certified. Under that circumstance we would not know who is coming into Australia. That is the Greens—things change all the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Gillard has been held to electoral ransom by the Greens. What a disaster, not for her or her government but for the thousands of Australian families that are worse off. Since when did slapping a tax on something make it greener, offer incent­ives for investment or deliver certainty for business? We started off with a carbon tax aimed at the 1,000 biggest polluters. Then it was 500. Then, according to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, it was 400. Now we are back up to 500. Another article that was in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> says real estate agents are attacking the Greens' slug on homeowners. The Real Estate Institute of WA president, Alan Bourke, said the move was 'a token green initiative that would achieve little greenhouse gas reduction but would saddle the housing sector with significant extra costs'. That means that, if you are selling a house or a unit, you have to get an assessor in to look at the green potential of your home. That would add another $1,000 of cost for those who are selling or renting a home to get an energy assessor to come in and rate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next thing is that the Greens are getting $30 billion for their renewable energy project, mainly wind. I would draw to the attention of the Greens that the local residents' appeal against AGL's Hallett 2 wind turbines, which are non-compliant with the EPA noise guidelines, was upheld in the South Australian Supreme Court. South Australia is being used as the basis for guidelines and other states are following its example, but 16 of the 34 turbines were turned off overnight by AGL. So renewable energy is not what it looks like. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Here we have another round of navel gazing and obstructionism from those opposite—obstructionism at a very important time in this parliamentary cycle, a time when we are attempting to get on with the job of pricing carbon. The Committee of the Whole is seriously looking at eight hours of wasted debating time already when there are amendments to the legislation, but we have this motion put forward by the opposition. This motion fails to comprehend history and fails to compre­hend, I might add, their voting record in this place on this issue. It fails to understand economics and fails to abide by their own principles—that great liberal philosophy of markets and efficiency. It fails to predict and plan for the future—a future which, as Senator Faulkner has quite eloquently outlined, is at risk because of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this motion there is a veiled implication that there is an alliance between the Labor Party and the Greens on this issue. Some have described it as an unholy alliance. Let me say to the Senate that the only unholy alliance that has occurred in this place in recent times was the alliance in which the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Greens voted together to oppose the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, to oppose the pricing of carbon. If that decision had not been taken by the Greens and those opposite then our economy would have an effective price on carbon. We would be investing in renewable technology. We would be driving jobs growth in the renewables sector. We would be trading permits in a domestic and an international market. So the only unholy alliance that has occurred in this place was on that unfortunate occasion when those opposite and the Greens combined to stop this parliament moving on with pricing carbon in our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is any party that has been consistent on this issue, it is the Labor Party. Our plan was developed in 2006 in consultation with members of the community and members of our party. We came up with a plan to price carbon through an emissions trading scheme. We took that to the 2007 election and the proposal was successful. Because we believe in climate change, we have been consistent about taking action on this very important issue. There have been no fewer than 37 inquiries in this parliament, dating back to 1992. All bar one, I believe—and that was the committee that Senator Cormann chaired—have recommended putting a price on carbon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the inquiry commissioned by former Prime Minister John Howard in 2007, the Shergold review, recommended support for an emissions trading scheme, a move to price carbon within our economy—but, then again, so did most of those opposite. If you go back to 2008 or 2009, in the wake of the Shergold inquiry, most of those opposite believed in an emissions trading scheme. I am not going to go into the comments of some of them, but I will go into the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, who said on 18 December 2008:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">An emissions trading scheme probably is the best way to put a price on carbon …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not agree more. Then on 2 October 2009 Mr Abbott said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We don't want to play games with the planet. So we are taking this issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I could not agree more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has changed since then? Those opposite try to make us believe that some fundamental shift occurred in the wake of Copenhagen and the failure to get a binding international agreement in respect of this issue. That fails to comprehend the fact that the policy of the Howard government was quite clear: despite the failure to reach an international agreement, they should push ahead with an ETS because it is the right thing to do and it gives our economy an advantage in that we move into the future on a reasonable basis and we are promoting investment and jobs in the renewables sector. Ninety countries have pledged commitments in international conventions, through the Kyoto protocol and the international climate change commission convention, to reduce emissions compared to a baseline level over time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of emissions trading schemes, there are 30-odd nations in the European Union that actively participate in an emissions trading scheme. One of our largest trading partners, a smaller economy than Australia that faces much greater difficulty when it comes to the health of its economy, New Zealand, moved to an emissions trading scheme a couple of years ago and it is winning advantages from that scheme in terms of investment in renewables and jobs growth in those sectors. Certain provinces in Canada have moved to an emissions trading scheme. Certain states within the United States have also. And China is trialling an emissions trading scheme in four of its provinces and part of its five-year plan is to move to an economy wide emissions trading scheme by the end of the five-year plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has changed is one thing and one thing alone: the Leader of the Opposition sees an opportunity to win an election—that is it; that is all that has changed. They have no belief, no principle and no consistency in this important policy area anymore. They simply say no and try to wreck the place because they see an opportunity to win an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it highly contradictory and unprincipled for them to adopt this policy stance in the light of Liberal Party philosophy. If you go to their website, you can see this written as one of their principles: they believe in the efficiency of markets in determining economic outcomes within a society and an economy. That might be the case, but not when it comes to this important policy issue, not when it comes to what is probably one of the most serious social and economic challenges of our generation. They put aside Liberal Party philosophy and principle and simply seek to develop a policy that they hope will win them an election. They do not show any leadership on this issue at all. They are the party who claim to be the party of the free market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, the only party of the free market in this place is the Australian Labor Party. We have developed the policy of pricing carbon through an emissions trading scheme because all of the advice throughout the world from economists, scientists and the like is that the cheapest and most effective way to reduce emissions within an economy is to use a market based mechanism. The most effective way is to price carbon and to provide incentives for players within the economy to reduce their emissions over time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party policy and philosophy are completely contrary to that; completely the opposite. They are going to provide subsidies for the biggest polluters within our economy in the hope that one day they might install emissions-friendly technology and reduce their emissions over time. This question needs to be asked: what about all those who are not receiving the subsidies? What about the rest of the economy? What about those small businesses that might not be at the top level in terms of emissions that will not receive a subsidy to reduce their emissions over time? What incentive will there be for those companies to reduce their emissions under such a scheme? Quite simply, there will be no incentive and emissions reductions will not occur within those companies economy wide. That is why the Liberal Party's scheme will not work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite want us also to believe that their scheme will not cost the economy, businesses, taxpayers or households. But they again fail to understand that there is not a no-cost option when it comes to reducing emissions in an economy—particularly in a capitalist market based economy. All polici­es to reduce emissions have costs associated with them. The emissions trading scheme happens to be the cheapest option. A subsidy based scheme will cost taxpayers. And under their scheme there will not be the assistance that the Labor scheme offers to households, businesses, pensioners, students and job seekers. That assistance is important to ensure that the most vulnerable—those on middle to low incomes—can make that transition from a polluting, carbon based economy to the clean energy future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MILNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I rise today to comment on the matter brought forward by Senator Bernardi and spoken to by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz. I note that neither of them are in the chamber—so much for the urgency of this particular proposal. I am not surprised that Senator Bernardi has brought forward a climate change denying, anti-climate-action proposal to the Senate. I note that he wants to discuss the wholesale adoption of the policy agenda of the Austra­lian Greens. I think that it is much more interesting to look at the wholesale adoption by Senator Bernardi of the policy agenda of the extreme US radical Right and the policies that he brings to the coalition in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Disgraced Liam Fox was a former minister in the UK who was forced to resign because of his association with a Mr Werritty. Mr Werritty was one member of the American Legislative Exchange Council. It is fascinating to see that the Australian representative of the American Legislative Exchange Council is none other than Senator Bernardi. The American Legislative Exchan­ge Council is backed by big oil, big tobacco, the National Rifle Association, the climate change deniers and the defence hawks in the US.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note with interest than on 2 June this year the American Legislative Exchange Council wrote to the Department of Health and Ageing opposing plain packaging and making a strong case, on behalf of big tobacco, against plain packaging. Among the people they copied it to was none other Senator Bernardi, their Australian represent­ative. You have to wonder about the extent to which Senator Bernardi has adopted their agenda and, indeed, the agenda of another US right-wing radical organisation, none other than the Heartland Institute. We recall that Senator Fielding went across to the US at the expense of the Heartland Institute and came back and told us that global warming was not real and was to do with solar flares et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a look at what Senator Bernardi has been up to that might give me cause for concern. It was reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age </span>recently that what appears to be a proliferation of community based anti-government activism sites is not necessarily what it seems. Several sites are part of an orchestrated political campaign by Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi and conservative organisations that he is linked with. Using American Tea Party style tactics, Senator Bernardi has built a network of grassroots political websites that promote limited government, lower taxes, free enterprise and traditional values, as well as campaigns against the government and its policies, most potently against the carbon tax. What we found from this article was that this disgraceful set of websites was linked to the Conservative Leadership Foundation, of which Senator Bernardi is the chair. But it was not until you actually got to donate money that you worked through and found out who the backer was. And where do you find where this domain is registered? Of course, it is in the US. So what we find is this very close link with Senator Bernardi, who is the representative of the American Legislative Exchange Council. They are a council that develop model laws, model legislation, on behalf of major corporates in the US, and they are laws which are under­mining wages and legal rights—it is a way that corporations get what they want, and corporations are on every single task force of the American Legislative Exchange Council. Interestingly, Donald Rumsfeld was a chair of one of their business boards in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, looking at this issue of the policy agenda and adoption of policy agendas, one has to ask the question about the links between the coalition in Australia and the Tea Party in the United States, the US radical Right, through the connection of the now acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate. This goes to the heart of Tories in the UK and it now apparently goes to the heart of the coalition in Australia. So let's look at this link between fake websites, very real corporate astroturfing organisations and the connection that Senator Cory Bernardi has with both.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Gillard Government’s broken pre-election promise not to introduce a carbon tax and their wholesale adoption of the policy agenda of their alliance partners, the Australian Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen since the August 2011 election is an absolute breach of faith by the government with the people of Australia. What we have witnessed is a total lack of regard and honour in the way in which the government has backflipped on its pledge to the Australian people. Why did Prime Minister Gillard go to that election and pledge, with her hand on her heart, six days before the election, that there 'will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'? We know why she did that: she knew that it was an unelectable position to take, that Australians did not want a carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say, when Senator Faulkner gets up and talks about the critical need for the imposition of a carbon tax now, and talks about us on this side of the chamber being oppositionist, I have to sit back and think: who was the person I was watching who, following the night of knives, when they knifed and ousted the then Prime Minister Rudd for the Prime-Minister-to-be, Julia Gillard, entered into the equation the need 'to maintain stability and continuity at a leadership level of the Labor Party'? It was Senator Faulkner. So what does Senator Faulkner do? He was by her side, literally joined at the hip to Prime Minister Gillard, as she campaigned during that last election. It was Senator Faulkner who was the campaign adviser. It was Senator Faulkner who was the Labor government strategist for the last election. And yet it is Senator Faulkner who was in here today saying that we were the ones who were oppositionist. All I can ask of Senator Faulkner is: if he was the strategist, and he believed in a carbon tax before the election, why did he not advise Prime Minister Gillard to pledge for a carbon tax? Why was the advice to the contrary? You really have to wonder where people's head space is in this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the bottom line is that we all know that they knew that they could not be elected with a carbon tax policy, and now they have backed off from that. It is very straightfor­ward. We know why that is the case: it is because the Greens have run the national agenda since they signed a formal alliance with Prime Minister Gillard. It is they who signed the formal alliance and determined that there would be a carbon tax. Why have we had debate after debate on this over the last few weeks? Because it is the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, who has said that he wishes to go to Durban with a carbon tax wrapped very neatly under his arm, with Prime Minister Gillard in tow. That is the only reason, I would suggest, we are debating this in the chamber now. It is not for any other reason than the pure ego of the Leader of the Greens, Senator Brown, that he wants to go to Durban with a carbon tax package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Senator Thistlethwaite: it is not something that every country is rapidly heading towards. Every nation, as we know, is walking away from a carbon tax. We will be the only nation that will be going to the United Nations climate change conference with a carbon tax. That they are saying this is something that is critical for this nation now, when we know it will hurt all Australians, is absolutely gob-smackingly arrogant; it is just extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last couple of weeks what we have witnessed here is a total abuse of the demo­cratic process not only by the government and the Greens but also of this place. We first of all had a long debate over the variation to the business hours of this place. The coalition voted against it, because we did not believe that this carbon tax could be effectively ventilated. The variation of business hours was supported by the Greens, with the government, so that they could tick off on this before Durban. This week we were meant just to be debating the carbon tax. So, not only are we not debating the carbon tax later in the week, but we are seeing a gag on a gag, a gag on a guillotine motion. So the carbon tax, which we were to have 20 hours of debate on, has now been gagged yet again from midday tomorrow. Why is that? Because the government and the Greens just want to get on the plane to Durban with it under their arms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are a real concern for this nation because of the way in which they are running this agenda. I note my colleague Senator Adams' comments on the article about the way in which they conducted their conference on the weekend. The Greens do not like scrutiny. The party holds its national conferences behind locked doors. This is a party that reminds me of a medieval cloister in the way in which it conducts its activities.

To hear Senator Kroger talking about the amount of time available for the committee stages of the bill is interesting because, of course, on this MPI we are just chewing up one hour of time that could possibly be used in the committee stage. That is indicative of the fact that the opposition are not really serious about debating the content of the bills. We saw that last week, when we spent a considerable period of time debating whether or not the Liberals should retain the chairmanship of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. A good couple of hours went on that debate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I am pleased to say that the government is proud of its record of implementing policies that have been and will be good for the Australian public and for Australia into the future. Our government's commitment to tackling climate change by reducing emissions is longstanding and is supported by the science. Indeed, the commitment to reducing harmful carbon emissions is also supported by the oppo­sition, although you would not know it from hearing some of the contributions from those opposite, who apparently think they know more than the scientists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The preferred method of the Labor government to reduce harmful emissions is to put a price on carbon, making the biggest polluters pay, and to encourage investment in cleaner renewable energy sources. That method of reducing harmful carbon emiss­ions is supported not just by scientists but also by all credible economists. Even former prime ministers support this method of reducing harmful carbon emissions that contribute to damaging climate change. And I note that it was part of the coalition's 2007 election policy, when, under former Prime Minister John Howard, their policy stated:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A re-elected Coalition government will establish the world's most comprehensive emissions trading scheme in Australia, commencing no later than 2012. The scheme will be the primary mechanism for reducing Australia's emissions at least cost to families and to Australia's economy."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there is no credible economic support for the opposition's so-called Direct Action plan, which we know will be ineffect­ive and more expensive for Australian working families. It would in fact cost Australian working families some $1,300 more in taxes if it were to be implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Labor government, when we moved to tackle climate change we did it in the usual Labor way, and that is a way that is fair and ensures we deliver opportunities for all Australians. We will compensate businesses and households through various compensa­tory and other mechanisms that will apply to individuals and businesses that may be affected by the price on carbon. For example, nine in 10 households will get tax cuts or pension or payment rises to help with living costs when the carbon price comes in. I note on this point, and it is a point never made by the opposition but often made by us, that average household costs will rise by the modest amount of $9.90 per week and the compensation that will be offered as part of the government's plan will be $10.10 per week. So, indeed, nine out of 10 Australian households will get tax cuts or pension payment rises to help cost of living increases and will not be out of pocket. But, of course, the opposition leave those facts out of the hysterical tirades that they continue to entertain us with in this chamber. It is part of their fear campaign—the cheap populist politics meant to mislead and deceive Australians. It is far easier for the opposition to be loose with the truth than to actually address the facts of the matters before the chamber with regard to climate change.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. Nothing should surprise those on this side of the chamber. The Greens demonstrate on what has now become an almost daily basis that they are only interested in observing the rules of the Senate when it suits their own particular political advantage. Yet day after day, and in particular in relation to the current debate that we have before the Senate, they confirm that they see themselves as nothing more and nothing less than an elitist group who believe that they are so important that the rules and regulations of the Senate should not apply to them. That is the reason that the Special Minister of State has had to table a statement in relation to the resignation of the Common­wealth Ombudsman. Again I go to the Special Minister of State's statement, in which he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Mr Asher's actions in dealing with an individual Senator and framing questions as he did, were not on the public record or otherwise apparent to other members of the Parliamentary Committee, and the questions themselves were far from neutral. He offered briefing on legislation that has not been introduced and on other matters that would have been of interest to all Members and Senators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But not all members and senators were offered that courtesy, because Senator Hanson-Young was having a private meeting with the Ombudsman in which they develop­ed questions to be raised in the estimates process that ultimately compromised the Ombudsman, the most independent office in the land, and led to his resignation. Again, you would expect nothing less from a member of the Australian Greens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As each day goes past Australians are now waking up to the fact that the Greens are quite possibly nothing more and nothing less than a party of complete, total and utter contradictions. Who can forget the hours over many years that the Greens have stood in this place and told the rest of us that the guillotining of bills is an abhorrent political practice? Why? Senator Bob Brown is on record as saying this: it prevents minor parties from engaging in proper political debate. Then what do we have? We have the Greens supporting time and time again under this new, unholy Labor-Greens alliance the guillotining of debate in this chamber. The vote that will be taken tomorrow in the chamber is the perfect example of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example: on one hand the Greens garner votes by pretending to be a cuddly, benign environmental party who are holier than thou. Yet what did we have the other day? Instead of taking over the chair of the environment committee, what committee did they want to take control of and what committee did they indeed take control of? The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. This again confirms that they are not the cuddly, benign environmental party that they want the Australian people—</span>

                  </a>  I will take the point of order myself. It was not a point of order from Senator Milne because Senator Milne clearly has not read the ministerial statement. If Senator Milne had, she would have under­stood that the entire ministerial statement, while it does not use the word, confirms without a doubt the complete, total and utter hypocrisy of the Australian Greens party. That is the point of my speech right now, which I will now elaborate on to ensure that what I am saying does have a direct link to the ministerial statement. Let us talk a little bit more about the complete, total and utter hypocrisy of the Australian Greens. Let us talk about their holier-than-thou approach to political parties other than the Australian Greens seeking financial donations. Their approach to financial donations is they are not okay for the ALP and the coalition. They say if we were to take a political donation there is something wrong with that. But who can forget the donation that the Australian Greens received from Graeme Wood, who gave them $1.6 million?</span>

                  </a>  $1.6 million which, Senator Williams, is a record donation for a political party. But they are opposed on principle—the Greens allegedly have some principles—to corporate political donations, unless, of course, that donation is going straight into the pockets of the Australian Greens party. What about this hypocrisy? When a coalition member misses a division, we are all subjected to a missive from the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Bob Brown; but, when Senator Bob Brown gets caught out doing the exact same thing, what happens? Nothing. Absolute silence. Deafening silence. That is complete, total and utter hypocrisy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens protested about the standards of parliamentary behaviour by attacking the sentiments expressed by 'no carbon tax' protesters outside Parliament House. But then, during a visit by the President of the United States, they interject whilst he is addressing our parliament. Again, that is rank hypocrisy from the current government's coalition partner.</span>

The Greens promote themselves as being the great defenders of democracy; but, in every doorstop interview that Senator Brown has done of late, he has had to point out why we need an inquiry into the Australian media—because God forbid that a journalist in this country actually exposes the Greens for what they are. I cannot wait till I have finished because I am quite sure that one member of the party is going to jump up and defend the Australian Greens, because I have said something bad about them and we all know that in this place nobody is allowed to say anything bad about the Australian Greens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Australian people are well and truly waking up to the way the Australian Greens operate. They are waking up to their gross hypocrisy, and it is clearly outlined in the statement by the Special Minister of State to the other place and now tabled in the Senate in relation to why the Commonwealth Ombudsman—the most independent office in this land—had to resign. It is because the Australian Greens colluded with the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Deception, dishonesty and duplicitous behaviour: they are the words that the Australian public are now using to describe the Australian Greens. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Yes, thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President Boyce, and I thank you for pulling up Senator Cash. As a consequence of those events, there was an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times </span>by Robin Brown, who is a Canberra consultant in effective governance and market regulation, and John Braithwaite, who is an Australian Research Council Fellow and founder of RegNet at the Australian National University. They wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As the media cycle moves on from the demise of former ombudsman Allan Asher, the Parliament must now repair the institution its members have damaged. Many MPs say Asher had to be pressured until he jumped to preserve the integrity of his office. We take the opposite view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is senior politicians and public servants who have now damaged the office by leaving the public asking the question: "Will the next ombudsman be their patsy?" Will persons of integrity want the job? Will whistleblowers lose confidence in baring their souls to the next ombudsman?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Asher's error was to push too hard on defending the rights of those in immigration detention centres. His email of questions to a Greens senator was the pretext for his demise. It was not the reason.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further on they said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The problem here was that neither the Government nor the Opposition liked Asher's interpretation of the public interest on immigration detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they are pointing to is that Mr Asher's valiant, intelligent and humane role, given to him by government, was to investigate immigration detention. Thousands of people are held in detention who, the Greens maintain, ought to be much more quickly released into the community, because that is where they, in the main, end up, and some are held to the point of mental breakdown and indeed, far too often, of seeking to commit suicide. But Mr Asher and his office were not given the wherewithal to undertake the extraordinary new load that was put onto his and his staff's shoulders, and he sought to get that information out into the public arena.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of Mr Asher's very valiant resignation to protect the position that he upheld, the Greens have not simply come to get into a debate with the opposition, or the government for that matter, but instead have drawn up an alternative which will help fix the problem, to ensure that no future Ombudsman is put in the impossible position that the good Mr Allan Asher was placed in. We are proposing to give a parliamentary committee oversight of the Ombudsman's office and, therefore, give the Ombudsman a parliamentary advocate for review of his funding and work levels. He will not have to go to another member of parliament to get the information out. Our proposal will assist in ensuring the executive remains at arm's length from the Ombudsman but will, simultaneously, give that Ombudsman an assurance that they are able, if they do not get adequate resources, to make that known and to appeal for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Australian Greens' proposal, the parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit will have its duties expanded to be able to examine the receipts and expenditure of the Ombudsman; to examine the Ombudsman's reports that are tabled in parliament; to report to parliament on any matters within those receipts, expenditure or reports that the committee thinks should be drawn to the attention of parliament; and to report to both houses any alteration the committee thinks desirable. The Public Accounts and Audit Committee already performs a similar role for the Auditor-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are not only defensive of the honour of and the sterling work done by Mr Asher in the office of Ombudsman; we have also moved to respond to an obvious oversight in not providing the Ombud­sman—that is, the office of Ombudsman; it did not matter which one was there—with a natural and easy facility to have information brought to the attention of parliament about the running of the Ombudsman's office and its needs. We will be looking to support from both the government and the opposition in having this positive change made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To go back to the Ombudsman himself: I am hoping to catch up with him in the near future to go over the matters that caused him extraordinary pain. They must have; no human being could go through that without extraordinary pain. I may be wrong about this but I do not think I have ever sat and had a talk with him, so I am looking forward to doing that. I think he has served this country well. He is an experienced officer who has worked in the UK and elsewhere in the world, as well as in Australia and for this nation, and I think he needs to know that that service is being recognised and that there is a hope that he will be able to continue that service without the events of recent times cutting across his ability to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the question I have asked myself through this episode is: what if he had not gone to Senator Sarah Hanson-Young? What if he had gone to an opposition backbencher, or frontbencher for that matter, or, indeed, to a government backbencher, and they had sought out the questions? He would still be in office. So, when we hear the sort of diatribe we just heard from Senator Cash about the Greens, you see a different way of treating the political connections that arise from time to time. I think the Ombudsman's downfall, if I can call it that, was very highly politically charged, and I think it was a sad day when he left office. However, he has been prepared to do that, and it was a mark of this man that he was prepared to do that, to prevent an ongoing furore over the office, to defend that office which he had served so well. I for one thank him for the service he has given this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="5K4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  The ministerial statement that the Senate is debating this afternoon is about the resignation of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Mr Asher. One could be forgiven for thinking, listening to Senator Cash's speech, that this might have been a ministerial statement about the Greens political party. But this is an important issue. And I think that, frankly, it warranted a more serious and considered contribution than the intemperate one that we received from Senator Cash on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, let me, as I have previously in this chamber—and also, of course, I have asked questions at the Senate's Finance and Public Administration Legislation Com­mittee—put on the record that I have absolutely no problem at all with any statutory officer of the Commonwealth, be it the Commonwealth Ombudsman or any other statutory office holder, making their concerns clear and public. There is no problem, in my mind, with a statutory officer questioning or criticising government policy, and there is certainly no problem with any statutory officer making a strong case for increased resources for their office. I have seen suggestions that the government has found the criticisms of the former Common­wealth Ombudsman, Mr Asher, as unaccept­able. I hope that is not the case. I have no reason to believe it is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact of the matter is that, from time to time, statutory office holders are going to make statements that are critical of govern­ments, that are embarrassing to governments of the day and that give ministers and officials discomfort. That is life. I am one person who, in this chamber, will always defend the right of any Ombud­sman or other statutory office holder to report on concerns with frankness and, as I have described before, with unvarnished truth, how ever uncomfortable these concerns might make a government feel. This, of course, does not relate at all to the expectations that each and every one of us should have that a statutory office holder, particularly one holding an office as important as the Ombudsman, must always exhibit the highest standards of behaviour. It is absolutely true that the head of an integrity agency must set the highest example. I certainly asked Mr Asher quest­ions at a Senate estimates committee. It was not a fix by the government, but I did inform both the opposition and the Greens that I intended to ask Mr Asher questions. I asked Mr Asher:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Do you think that an integrity agency such as the Ombudsman should set an example, should have the highest standards in government?</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said in response to my question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Yes, it should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I then asked him:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Have you met those highest standards?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think this was clearly an error in judgment. It was clearly a mistake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the public record here shows that Mr Asher said that he considered his actions in relation to the issue of the provision of questions to a senator to be an error of judgment. He considered his actions to be a mistake. He apologised to a Senate committee for his actions and he made it absolutely clear that it would not happen again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there is a question about whether this is a resigning offence. I have seen the comments that have been made, including by Senator Brown and Senator Hanson-Young, that the Ombudsman's resignation occurred as a result of a witch-hunt, conducted allegedly because he had caused the government discomfort. I reject that absolutely. Senator Brown has said, and I have quoted this previously in the chamber, that the Ombudsman was a decent man, working in the public interest and that he had been politically assassinated. I agree with all of what Senator Brown said about the decency of Mr Asher—he is a decent man; there is no question about that. He is a good man, but he made a serious mistake. He made a very serious mistake, in my mind, as the head of an integrity agency. The critical thing here is that he has to be able to justify that he is acting in an impartial way. He has to be able to defend the integrity of the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office. He has to be able to assure all of us, from every political party, and those who do not represent a political party in this parliament and beyond, that he is acting in an apolitical way. Integrity matters. Independence of the office matters. Impartiality matters. That is the problem that we face in this regard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are entitled to expect more from the head of an integrity agency than we expect from others. We are entitled to expect that the head of an integrity agency sets the highest of examples for us all to follow. I asked Mr Asher at Senate estimates:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Do you think that an integrity agency such as the Ombudsman should set an example, should have the highest standards in government?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Yes, it should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked him:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said that he thought this was clearly an error of judgment, clearly a mistake. The issue is not that there is any lack of acknow­ledgement that an error was made; I suppose that, given the concerns about this affecting the impartiality, independence and integrity of the Ombudsman's office, the issue is: should the Ombudsman have resigned in this circumstance? That is a matter for him. I have made no judgment about that. I certainly did not ask at estimates whether he considered offering his resignation or not, though I have asked that at times of other Commonwealth officials. This is a serious point that all senators, regardless of their political party, ought to take account of. I do not accept what Senator Brown said when he asked, 'What if those questions had gone to an opposition senator?'. I do not care whether they go to an opposition senator, a Greens senator, a government senator or anyone else. I do not think it should have happened, because I personally believe there are more appropriate avenues available to an ombuds­man or statutory officer to raise genuinely held—very genuinely held—concerns. You can do it more formally to a Senate committee—by communicating not just to one senator but to the whole committee in an opening statement or in another formal communication—or with ministers, by press release, in an annual report or in a speech. There are plenty of opportunities, and I beli­eve that is what the Ombudsman should have done in this circumstance. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to read the response of the Premier of Queensland to the resolution of the Senate of 22 September relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander hearing health. In that resolution, the Senate noted that a group of experts from the health and education sector, community representatives and business had met here to talk about hearing health. It also noted the importance of hearing health and the occurrence of otitis media and the extraordinary rate at which it is affecting Aboriginal communities. The substantive paragraph was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b)  calls on state and federal governments to commit to working collaboratively on a holistic, sustained, cross-disciplinary approach to addressing this issue and its effects.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Premier Bligh has written to inform the Senate of the Deadly Ears program that is currently running in 12 communities in remote Queensland. Apparently over 3,000 children have been treated and the program has delivered over 700 surgical procedures. People from Deadly Ears in fact attended the forum that was held in parliament and talked about the importance of their program—the fact that it is a multidisciplinary service and that the team is dedicated to promoting health, workforce development and staff training in allied health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing here is that this is in Queensland; it is not going to all commu­nities. The Premier noted at the end of her letter that the Queensland government would welcome any move to extend this successful program to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children elsewhere in Austra­lia. I certainly support the suggestion that this is the type of program that does need to be supported. It is absolutely essential that we target specific programs to address otitis media so that we deal with the problem where it starts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, it is absolutely crucial that we have a coordinated, holistic approa­ch, which the motion also went to. Unfortu­nately, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have been affected by otitis media to a point where their hearing has been significantly impacted, and that has impacted their learning processes. A child's brain starts to develop its language skills and to allocate functions from around six months old. We already know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children can be infected with otitis media from three weeks old and then subsequently reinfected. We have a situation where many children have already suffered significant hearing impair­ment when they start attending school, and unfortunately the school programs at the moment are not meeting their needs. Children are perhaps being taught in a language that is not their first language, they cannot hear, and there are no sound fields in their classrooms. The unfortunate situation we heard about during the Community Affairs References Committee inquiry, which we documented in our report <span style="font-style:italic;">Hear us</span>, is that sound fields are not universally accessible in classrooms across this country and Australian Hearing is unable to provide funding for sound fields in classrooms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I acknowledge that the government has committed further funding to assist students with disabilities in schools and has, as I understand it, indicated that a school could apply for funding for a sound field, it is not a universal program. If we are to address hearing impairment, language devel­opment and educational outcomes, we need to address this issue as children start day one of their school life. Not only that but, as the community affairs committee report also recommended, testing programs should be undertaken as students start preschool and school. The newborn screening program picks up only a percentage of hearing loss—that is, genetic hearing loss or hearing loss at birth. As I have just articulated, otitis media infects babies once they are born. So that program does not pick up the hearing loss associated with continual otitis media, or glue ear, as it is commonly known. What we need, therefore, is a program which screens every child as they begin school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs recommended that such a program should be universal and should start particularly with schools which have a large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. We know very clearly from the research that those children are disproport­ionately affected by otitis media, by glue ear, and therefore have subsequent hearing loss. I very strongly commend the fact that this program is running in Queensland. I have in fact met on several occasions people work­ing in this program. I understand it is having a positive impact and needs to be rolled out further across the country as part of a holistic plan to address hearing health in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs documented that the impact it can have is that students are alien­ated from school and the educating system, have poor educational outcomes, experience social isolation and increased contact with juvenile justice and the justice system. From recent research, we know that 90 per cent of the Aboriginal prisoners in the Darwin Corr­ectional Centre have some form of hearing impairment. You do not have to be Einstein to work out that there is an issue here. We constantly talk in this place about addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander intera­ction with the justice system, poor educati­onal outcomes and the need to develop better employment outcomes. We need to be join­ing the dots and making sure that we have a comprehensive and holistic plan which addresses hearing health. We will start addr­essing some of the very poor statistics and poor educational and employment outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</span>

The Report provided an important resource that assisted the Government’s deliberations and contribution to decisions, through the Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council), in respect of NRAS and its implementation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The delay in the Australian Government’s response to the Committee’s Report is a result of a number of ongoing developments up until recently, in relation to NRAS, in particular the passage of legislation through state Parliaments and the commencement of the NRAS on </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1 July 2010.  National registration is now in force for practitioners in ten health professions.  The professions currently regulated under NRAS are chiropractic, dental practice, medicine, nursing and midwifery, optometry, osteopathy, pharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry and psychology.  More than 529,000 health practitioners across these ten different health professions are now registered under the National Scheme.  A further four professions are scheduled to enter NRAS on 1 July 2012, namely Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practice, Chinese medicine practice, medical radiation practice and occupational therapy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 26 March 2008, the Council of Australian Governments signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) to implement NRAS by 1 July 2010 to align the previously disparate state and territory registration schemes for health practitioners.  The intended benefits of NRAS include mobility for health practitioners, consist­ent standards for registration and professional conduct across Australia, administrative efficiency, and transparency through a national public register of health practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The legislative framework for NRAS is an applied laws model, with Queensland as the lead state.  On 25 November 2008, Queensland introduced the Health Practitioner Regulation (Administrative Arrangements) National Law Act 2008, which established the structure and functions of the NRAS, and received Royal Assent in Queensland.  On 12 June 2009, the Ministerial Council released the exposure draft of the second stage of legislation for the Scheme, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009 (Bill B) for a five week public consultation period, to 17 July 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 29 October 2009, Bill B was passed in the Queensland Parliament.  On 3 November 2009, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009, known as the National Law, received Royal Assent in Queensland.  Under the applied laws model, each jurisdiction enacted separate pieces of legislation (commonly referred to as Bill C) adopting the National Law, and thereby achieving the Scheme’s objectives.  All states and territories, with the exception of Western Australia, passed legislation to adopt and apply the National Law as a law from 1 July 2010.  Western Australia passed its corresponding legislation on 18 August 2010 and subsequently joined NRAS on 18 October 2010.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All matters raised by the Committee were considered in the context of the passage of the Queensland legislation and during the development of the Commonwealth’s Bill.  However, the Commonwealth was not required to move legislation to introduce the National Scheme because under the Australian Constitution the power to regulate health practitioners resides with the states and territories, not with the Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth introduced a Bill on 24 February 2010 (Bill C) to make consequential and transitional amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to streamline Medicare processes and align the Commonwealth legislation with the National Law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth’s Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Act 2010 received Royal Assent on 30 March 2010.  The amendments to the Commonwealth legislation (and associated regulations) will commence on a date to be proclaimed, once data processes and systems used by both the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and Medicare Australia are fully aligned.  Until that time, existing arrangements will continue to apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following the commencement of NRAS on 1 July 2011, there were a number of transitional issues, particularly around access and registration processes within AHPRA, during the transition to the new Scheme.  In response to these concerns, Health Ministers agreed at their meeting of 17 February 2011 to provide additional support and expertise to assist AHPRA in managing its registration function, to introduce additional monitoring of AHPRA, and a requirement for AHPRA to provide regular reports to future meetings of Health Ministers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This document details the Australian Government Response to the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement (PJC): Inquiry into the Adequacy of Aviation and Maritime Security Measures to Combat Serious and Organised Crime. The Government thanks the Committee for its inquiry and the report.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2008, as a part of the Prime Minister's inaugural National Security Statement, the Australian Government recognised serious and organised crime as a national security threat and a growing national challenge. In response, the Australian Government launched the Organised Crime Strategic Framework in 2009 which establishes a comprehensive and coordinated response to target organised crime wherever it exists—including at the border.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's approach to border control and law enforcement at airports and seaports is a multi-layered and cooperative effort between Commonwealth, and State and Territory agencies, as well as partnership with the aviation and maritime sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At both airports and seaports, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs and Border Protection) is responsible for protecting the safety, security and integrity of Australia's border through a wide range of regulatory and enforcement powers. Key functions include preventing and intercepting illegal movements of people and goods (such as illicit drugs and firearms) across the Australian border. In undertaking this role, Customs and Border Protection primarily works with a range of key Commonwealth partners, including the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Office of Transport Security (OTS) within Department of Infrastructure and Transport (DIT) provides the Australian Government with policy advice and regulatory oversight of preventive transport security in the aviation, maritime, offshore oil and gas and air cargo sectors. This is achieved through the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 (ATSA), the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 (MTOFSA), and associated regulations. The approach to preventive security embodied within the ATSA and the MTOFSA focuses on the protection of transport assets and those who use them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">OTS follows a risk-based, outcomes-focused approach to regulation through consultation with industry and international engagement. OTS works with industry to ensure compliance with the law and regulations by effecting changes in industry participant behaviour towards their regulatory obligations. Within the international context, OTS contributes to the achievement of Australian Government outcomes on transport security by working closely with the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization, and by subscribing to international treaties and participating to international forums.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The AFP is the primary law-enforcement agency at Australia's 11 major airports through its Unified Policing Model. These airports are Adelaide, Alice Springs, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, Darwin, Gold Coast, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The AFP's role will be strengthened through the move to “All-in” policing at major airports. Law enforcement at regional Australian airports is primarily the responsibility of the States and Territories.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The AFP's key tasks in the aviation environment are targeting organised crime, deterring acts of terrorism, providing a uniformed policing presence, providing a first response to acts of terrorism and emergency incidents, collecting and analysing aviation intelligence and conducting investigations. In undertaking this role, the AFP works closely with airport operators and airlines in addition to Commonwealth, State and Territories agencies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The States and Territories retain the primary responsibility for enforcing state offences and criminal law at Australian ports. The AFP has the primary responsibility for investigating federal crime in the wider maritime environment. There are arrangements in place to ensure close cooperation between Commonwealth, and State and Territory agencies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACC, as the national criminal intelligence agency, plays an important role in supporting the law enforcement community and the broader government, including at Australia's airports and seaports. This includes the provision of a range of strategic, tactical and operational intelligence products which provide partner agencies with the context to understand serious and organised criminal threats to Australia. In undertaking this role, the ACC utilises its national criminal intelligence holdings, coercive powers and a national legislative and organisational framework that facilitates cooperation on a range of operational outcomes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework states that industry “has a key role in understanding its environment and identifying potential opportunities for organised crime exploitation”. The Government's approach to organised and serious crime is based on “preventative partnerships” between government and industry participants.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ATSA and MTOFSA, administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, are designed to provide a national regulatory framework for the aviation, maritime, and offshore oil and gas sectors. They require industry participants to prepare transport security plans and implement risk based preventive security measures aimed at facilitating transport by reducing the risk of unlawful interference with transport systems under their control. Any amendments to the ATSA and MTOFSA have always been developed in a way that minimises the impact on industry, in line with the Government's objective of achieving an efficient, sustainable, competitive and secure transport system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Noting the above, it is proposed that the Attorney-General's Department, in close consultation with the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, establish an aviation and maritime industry forum to examine options for organised and serious crime prevention at Australian airports and seaports in partnership with industry. This will include examining legislative change options, such as the potential to enhance powers under the Customs Act 1901, in the context of working with industry to address serious and organised crime in the aviation and maritime border environments. This would be informed by ACC risk assessments relevant to organised and serious crime in Australia's airports and seaports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Noted. Mobile telephony is currently provided by the private sector.  The Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government is considering what support might be available for these activities. However, there are significant areas of mainland Australia that do not have mobile telephony infrastructure and services to the same level as metropolitan areas.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As stated in its responses to questions on notice to the Committee in October 2009, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy understands the Indian Ocean Territories do not have access to mainland mobile networks.   There is currently no Australian Government funding available for the extension of mobile telephony infrastructure.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The provision of mobile phone coverage in a particular area is primarily a commercial decision made by mobile phone carriers. In making the decision to extend coverage to a particular area, carriers consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Carriers partly base this decision on how many people live and travel through the area, placing towers where there is a higher level of use. The cost to install towers in the Indian Ocean Territories could be great, especially given that the underlying infrastructure may also require an upgrade. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It may be useful for organisations or communities in the Indian Ocean Territories to identify for carriers the potential demand for mobile services in the area. Information such as current and projected growth of population, together with records of traffic volumes can be helpful in assisting carriers to make informed decisions about whether to extend coverage to certain areas. </span>

In that context, and given some of the statements that the minister has made during this debate and during question time today, I would like the minister to advise the chamber whether she stands by the government's own modelling of the impact of the carbon tax on the Australian economy—that by 2050 it will lead to a GDP which will be $100 billion lower, which will lead to real wages being nearly six per cent lower by 2050, which, of course, will lead to CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2 </span>emissions being 43 million tonnes higher than they currently are. Do the minister and government stand by those findings of the government's own Treasury modelling?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  The minister cannot even get herself to concede the point that her government's own Treasury modelling shows that, by 2050, GDP will be $100 billion lower than it would be without a carbon tax and that real wages will be six per cent lower than they would be without a carbon tax. Is there any point in time in the future when the government expects that the reduction in real wages, compared to a scenario without a carbon tax, is going to plateau? I refer to chart 5-12 on real wages, which has been published on page 88 and just keeps going down and down and down. Is there a time when this downwards trending line, which is the change in real wages under the government's carbon tax, is actually going to plateau? Is it expected to then increase again or will it continue to reduce, reduce and reduce further? If so, why should people not be allowed to have a say on whether they are happy to have a carbon tax under which emissions will continue to increase, where real wages will be lower than they would be without a carbon tax and where the economy will be smaller than it would be without a carbon tax?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deregulation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  I think there were two propositions. One was that I was being asked to give an indication of what might happen mid-century. Obviously, what I would say to the senator is that, whilst I have enormous regard for Treasury modellers, I think they would acknowledge that when you are looking at 2050 it is difficult to be completely precise about what will happen in that time frame. But I would also make the point that the findings of the modelling are as I outlined earlier: continued growth in the economy, jobs and income, as well as the reduction in emissions from what they would otherwise be. That is the consistent set of findings from this modelling and the previous modelling. I would also make the point that the modelling does cost the costs of climate change. So we do not have in that modelling the counterbalancing set of costs that the senator does not want to talk about, which are the costs of climate change to our economy, the costs of climate change in terms of the risk that future generations of Australians will have to contend with. I think that is an important point. We do not propose this set of legislation simply as an environmental policy. It is an economic policy. It is changing the way the economy works and it is providing an economic solution to what ultimately in many ways is an economic problem, which is that we externalise the costs of pollution, we do not trap them in any way; what we do is simply defer them to the next generation and beyond. I think the senator is speaking in relation to the opposition's amendment—or Senator Xenophon's amendment, which is the same. I make this point: this is an amendment about delay in relation to a policy where we know that delay increases the costs. In this chamber we are debating policy which has been the subject of debate in this country for almost two decades. There have been some 37 parliamentary inquiries since 1991 and a number of public reviews, including the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading, commissioned by Mr Howard, headed by Dr Shergold, which reported in 2007 and which led to the policy to price carbon through an emissions trading scheme, which the senator used to support. We have had debate in the context of the CPRS, which I think had 60-odd hours of debate—I might be wrong on that but I think that is about right. We have had lengthy debate and many Senate inquiries, including a number, I think, in which Senator Cormann was engaged.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I disagree with their position but I accept that the opposition oppose this. I do not accept the basis of their opposition. They used to support this when they were more sensible when it came to economic policy and policy more generally. They are simply trying to delay something they oppose. They have consistently done that in the course of this debate. The government's view is that it is time that the country acted, for the reasons we have outlined.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  This carbon tax will of course do nothing to prevent climate change from occurring. In fact, as we have argued before, this carbon tax in Australia, in the absence of an appropriate and comprehensive global agreement, might well worsen climate change to the extent that it will increase emissions in other parts of the world. I just want to go back to the question at hand, the question that the minister clearly does not want to answer: the impact of this carbon tax on our GDP. It is our job here in the Senate to get the government to answer some questions, and ultimately the Australian people should be able to have a say before an economic change of this magnitude is imposed on the Australian economy—which is, of course, what this amendment is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister says that there is a cost of delay and that it is important to act now because, that way, action will be cheaper than it otherwise would be. That does not seem to be the conclusion of the Treasury modelling. If you compare the Treasury modelling of the impact of the carbon tax with the Treasury modelling of the impact of the CPRS, even though the government is now starting a couple of years later, accord­ing to the Treasury modelling, the cost of acting now, a couple of years later, compared to the cost of acting when the government put forward the CPRS, has actually gone down, if we are to believe the government's Treasury modelling. The cost is actually lower now than it would have been if we had acted three years ago, in 2008. If it is cheaper to act now than it was three years ago, how much cheaper is it going to be to act in three, five or 10 years time? Perhaps in other parts of the world they are not going to have the same difficulties, quite frankly, in transition­ing the economy from one which is very export oriented, which is very emissions intensive and which relies on a significant resource endowment as one of its competitive advantages. Why would we go ahead of the rest of the world to this extent when clearly the longer we wait the more costs are going down?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to the question at hand: given that the Treasury's own modelling—and the minister says she stands by the modelling—shows that, by 2050, GDP would be $100 billion lower that year alone than it would be without a carbon tax, and given that GDP will be lower every single year between now and 2050 than it would be without a carbon tax, has the minister assessed the cumulative impact on Australia's GDP? Is the minister aware of what the cumulative cost to Australia's GDP is going to be between now and 2050, according to the Treasury's own modelling? Does the minister know what that cost is in today's dollars?</span>

The fact is that all of the expert advice from economists and scientists states that the longer we delay taking action on carbon pricing, the greater the cost for our economy. The fact is that the cheapest, most efficient means of reducing emissions in our economy is through a market based mechanism, a philosophy that used to be believed by those opposite but, since there has been a change in the leadership, no longer is the policy of the Liberal Party. There have been numerous studies, many of them parliamentary in nature—37-odd inquiries—where the issue has been canvassed: the fact that carbon pricing is the cheapest way to go, and the delays associated with that. And of course there are studies from economists.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. We can go back to the Stern review, which was the pacesetter, really, in terms of international studies and the economics associated with pricing carbon and the costs associated with delaying. That was six years ago, and we are still debating this issue here in the parliament. The Australian public is still waiting for action. Australian businesses are still waiting for action to ensure that there is certainty. Senator Cormann has questioned the minister in respect of costs associated with delay. This is an issue that Senator Cormann should be well versed in. It is an issue that has been canvassed and discussed in detail in the Senate Select Committee on the Scrutiny of New Taxes inquiry into the carbon pricing legislation, which he chaired. I think there were four occasions on which Treasury officials appeared before that committee and they underwent quite rigorous and detailed questioning from all sides, particularly on questions associated with the modelling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw Senator Cormann's attention to the final report of the Scrutiny of New Taxes committee into a carbon pricing mechanism and, in particular, to the government senators' dissenting report where the issue of delay and the costs associated with that is highlighted. I also draw Senator Cormann's attention to the questioning that was undertaken during that process when Ms Quinn and other Treasury officials appeared before the committee and the issue associated with delay was put to Ms Quinn. The question was: 'Had Treasury done any analysis of the costs associated with delaying the introduction of a carbon scheme in the Australian economy?' Ms Quinn's quite detailed response illuminated the fact that there were costs for the Australian community and economy—households and businesses—associated with delaying the introduction of a carbon pricing mechanism in our economy. She said: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The analysis that we did suggests that a delay in global action by three years adds around 20 per cent to the first year of global mitigation costs and delaying entry by a further three years adds a further 30 per cent to the first year of mitigation costs. This suggests that, as you delay, the costs only get greater through time ...</span>

It accords with the modelling that has been conducted by a number of credible modelling agencies. It accords with the government's overall view of the reasons behind this policy. It accords with the Treasury's analysis of why an emissions trading scheme and a market based mechanism is the most efficient means of reducing emissions for the least cost in our economy. Of course, it accords with that typical traditional Liberal Party philosophy that markets work efficiently, which has not been adopted by those opposite under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. </span>

He is aware of the fact that, if we are going to be serious about introducing a scheme that will provide incentives across the economy, we need a market based mechanism. That is borne out in the evidence of Ms Quinn to the inquiry chaired by Senator Cormann. So I find it quite amazing that we have had eight hours of debate on this issue in the committee of the whole and we are still tossing around the platitudes and the rhetoric associated with this issue. It is about time that we got onto debating the actual amendments. </span>

                    </a>  I am asked about GDP and GNI. I refer to the modelling at page 98 of the Treasury document, where the findings are that real income continues to grow with carbon pricing. There is an explanation as to why GNI has been focused on, although GDP is also measured. It states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">GNI is a better measure of welfare because it also accounts for that part of domestically generated income that accrues to non-residents, including that part required to pay for abatement sourced overseas. It also accounts for foreign generated income that accrues to domestic residents.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's GNI per person ... in both domestic policy scenarios—core and high price—grows at rates only slightly below those expected without carbon pricing. In the core policy scenario, GNI per person in today's dollars will be $9,000 higher in 2020 than it is today and more than $30,000 higher in 2050—an increase that is smaller than in the medium global action scenario, in which Australia does not price carbon, by just $320 per person in 2020 ... </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 2010 to 2050, GNI per person grows at an average rate of 1.1 per cent per year in the core policy scenario compared to 1.2 per cent per year, if carbon levels continue unabated along their upward trajectory. That is, Australia's GNI per person continues to grow at a rate only around 0.1 of a percentage point per year slower than it would without carbon pricing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also asked about GDP. I wanted to place on the record why the GNI measure has been preferred. GDP is also discussed in the report and, as I previously indicated, GDP continues to grow with carbon pricing and will be nearly three times as large by 2050 as it was in 2010. GDP grows in the core policy scenario by 2.6 per cent per year to 2050, slightly lower than the rate of more than 2.7 per cent per year in the medium global action scenario. This shows that we can continue to grow our incomes and our economy as well as jobs with a price on carbon. I again make the point that the Treasury modelling does not cost the cost of climate change, something that the senator wishes to disregard but which is actually very relevant to the reason Mr Howard signed up to a price on carbon.</span>

That is just extraordinary. There is absolutely no reason, apart from padding out some sort of filibuster—goodness knows why—for this from the senator on the other side, who did not even ask a question. It is just another example of the process of this place having gone completely pear shaped under this government. On the one hand on the other side they say: 'Hurry up, hurry up. Let's get all this done with. You know you are going to vote against it. Why are you even talking about this, coalition?' And yet we have senators on the government side coming in and blithering on with not so much as a question at the end of it all. That is an extraordinary way for a government to run the chamber.</span>

I know we have canvassed this before, so I am not going to go into it at length, but it just seems absolutely extraordinary that the government and the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, will not wait until after another election to bring this carbon tax in. Why not? I wonder why not, colleagues. We all know why not. She is not game to take it to the Australian people because the people out there across these communities are saying loud and clear that they do not want a carbon tax.</span>

                    </a>  Interestingly, Senator Xenophon is supporting this amendment to not have a carbon tax start until after the next election. So regardless of your view as to the intent of what the Prime Minister said before the last election, the Australian people deserve to be able to have a say on this piece of legislation, which they have been denied by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and the Labor government. That is just simply wrong. That is why we are moving this amendment. It is so the Australian people can have their voices heard and have their say, because, goodness knows, they have not had an opportunity to do that up until now. Obviously, with the Greens and Labor banding together in their usual coalition form, it looks like they still will not get a say. We can tell that this amendment is not going to be successful. Much as we hoped it would be, we can tell it is not going to be successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things about this legislation, this carbon tax, is the impost that it is going to place on our agricultural communities. It is quite extraordinary. The government like to say that agriculture is not included. When they say that, they refuse to properly and correctly say that agricultural emissions are not included. I can tell you, colleagues, as you all well know, the financial burden that is going to be faced by our farmers because of the introduction of this carbon tax is going to be huge. Electricity, fuel, fertiliser and transport will be affected, just for starters. There is nowhere for those costs to be passed on to. Farmers are the bottom of the food chain and there is nowhere for those costs to be passed on to. That might not be a concern for the government but that greatly concerns me and my colleagues on this side of the chamber in the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to ask the minister if she could perhaps enlighten the chamber on what modelling has been done to determine the average electricity cost increase across the farming community. I understand the minister may not have specific details, but I am interested in even just an average cost increase across those communities. Also, what assistance, if any, has been considered by the government or is in place to assist those farmers with the increased electricity costs?</span>

One could extrapolate, I suppose, to different communities on that basis. The CPI impact on prices is about 0.7 per cent in 2012-13. That is an average cost of $9.90 a week. In terms of the break-up of that, food is less than $1 a week on average, electricity is about $3.30 a week, gas is about $1.50 a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the assistance, nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance through tax cuts and/or payment increases. Of those, two out of three will get tax cuts or increased payments that cover their entire average price impact. Around four million Australian households will get an extra buffer with assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than their expected price impact. There will be an increase in payments of about 1.7 per cent. This includes increases to pensions, family tax benefits, disability support payment, carer payment and other allowances. There is assistance to self-funded retirees who receive the healthcare card, who receive the same dollar amount as the age pension. There are also the tax cuts to which I referred earlier whereby we will be tripling the tax-free threshold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Agricultural emissions are excluded from the carbon price mechanism. The govern­ment, after discussions with Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott—I am sure that warms the cockles of Senator Nash's heart—through a bill that passed the parliament earlier this year, is giving farmers, forest growers and landholders access to carbon markets worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year by 2020. As part of the clean energy future plan the government announced seven new land sector based measures with over $1.7 billion worth of funding over the next six years. These measures include carbon farming futures; the Indigenous Carbon Farming Fund; the Biodiversity Fund; the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund, which includes support for NRM organisations; the Carbon Farming Skills initiative; the Non-Kyoto Carbon Fund, which enables government purchase of land-sector abatement which is not counted towards Australia's emissions target, so that is more generous than under the CPRS to landholders; as well as the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board to provide information and advice on the implementation of measures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition you will recall, Senator, that in answer to your colleague Senator Williams—you may not have been in the chamber, although, to give credit where credit is due, you have been quite disciplined about being here—we had a discussion about the assistance that would be provided under the $150 million food and foundries program.</span>

She referred to a whole range of things, but not specifically to an average increase in electricity costs for farmers. I do not know if the modelling has not been done, and I understand the minister will not have everything at her fingertips, but it is a significant issue. It is quite concerning for farmers and people across regional commu­nities that, when asked a very simple question about the average increase in electricity costs to farmers, the minister was not able to give the chamber a straight answer. I think that is very concerning because it indicates perhaps a lack of attention or understanding of the importance of this issue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister did mention in her answer that there was a calculation based on small businesses or householders. If I understood it correctly, there is small business and householder assistance. Family farms are classified as both, so has that been taken into account when determining any assistance? I also ask the minister, given that the government has recently released the National Food Plan, what impact of the carbon tax on farming and agriculture has been taken into account when formulating that plan. There is going to be a significant impost on farmers and right across our regional communities, through farming businesses and the flow-on effects. That significant impost has to impact on farm profitability—there is absolutely no doubt about that. So to what extent was the carbon tax impact taken into account in the development of the National Food Plan?</span>

It would be very difficult to work out how you would do that. What you do do is economy-wide modelling that assesses the impact on prices. As I said to you, it is about 0.7 per cent. And I have outlined to you the assistance mechanisms that would be provided for households, including farming households, through the tax system, through the payments system, through the pension system, through family tax benefits and, of course, through the tripling of the tax-free threshold.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know if you were asking about fuel but, as you know, the government made clear how fuel will be included or not included in the scheme. Essentially, the mechanism is that on-road use is out, off-road use is in, except for agriculture, forestry and fisheries. So there is quite a significant amount of assistance being provided through the household assistance package that I have outlined. I am not sure what more the senator would want.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken about the CFI, the Carbon Farming Initiative. I have also made the point that agriculture is excluded. I would also advise that the Treasury modelling shows that gross output in the sector would be slightly higher with a carbon price than without. Under the food and foundries program, special assistance will be provided to the food-processing, metal-forging and foundry industries. The government will provide grants worth up to $150 million over six years to the food-processing industry. All businesses in the food-processing, metal-forging and foundry industries will be able to apply for funding under this program. The government understands that these industries are important to specific rural and regional areas. Funding will be on a current investment basis.</span>

You do not assess by occupation. It would be like saying that we should work out what the electricity cost to someone in a different occupation is. If the question is what is the impact on the agricultural sector, that is a different question to the impact on an occupation. I have outlined what the response to that is and I have outlined the additional assistance which is in place. I make the point that you are looking at about a 0.7 increase on the CPI across the economy.</span>

I am sure that there are farmers and people in regional communities across this country who are going to be absolutely gobsmacked by the fact—and I take your point, Minister; you say it is across the industries—that the government has obviously made no attempt to actually understand what the impact of the electricity cost increase is going to be for farmers.</span>

It is entirely different. My apologies to the chamber if I was not clear. I would like know: leaving household electricity increases aside, what is the average cost increase per farm of the electricity increases that are going to occur as a result of the carbon tax?</span>

It might be that there is some differential between different industries in terms of carbon price impact, and I can illustrate that by reference to dairy farms. The carbon price impact on dairy prices is projected to be 0.4 per cent, which reflects the low emissions intensity of dairy processing and the impact of the exclusion of agricultural emissions—</span>

What I want to know is the on-farm increased electricity costs that farmers will have to pay because their electricity bill goes up. I am not that interested in the overall effect on the increase or the decrease of the cents-per-litre price or anything else. Just very simply, how much extra on average will a farmer have to pay for their non-household electricity increases as a result of the carbon tax?</span>

I think we are now getting a little closer to some sort of indication of what the impact is going to be. Thank you for the figure of 10 per cent, again reiterating that there is nowhere for these costs to be passed on. Minister, I did ask in the first instance if you could give me an average figure. Obviously the work has not been done. Now we do have the 10 per cent figure on the record. Before I move on, could the minister perhaps answer the second part of my question, which related to the national food plan.</span>

Thank you, through you, Madam Chair, to the minister. Perhaps at some stage between now and lunchtime tomorrow the minister might like to give us some advice on that through this process. That would be quite useful. Also, the electricity costs which have been referred to certainly provide a significant disincentive when it comes to irrigated agriculture. A lot of these costs are going to fall to the irrigation community. We know they are going to be significant, looking at the 10 per cent cost that the minister has just referred to. They are going to be huge in a lot of cases for a lot of these farmers. What I am interested in is irrigated agriculture. Minister, you would be very well aware of all of this. The increased electricity costs are going to provide a real disincentive for irrigators to install piped and pressurised systems so that they can be far more efficient in what they are doing. Isn't it the case, then, that the carbon tax, by placing these increased electricity costs which we have just been discussing on farmers, is going to have the very perverse outcome of providing a disincentive to farmers being more efficient when it comes to irrigated agriculture?</span>

Firms in the electricity generation sector have made clear to the opposition that the policy of repealing the carbon price and telling people that they should not buy forward contracts and trying to foment as much as uncertainty as possible will also lead to an increase in electricity costs. So do not come in here talking about electricity cost increases, when your policies are about ensuring there is uncertainty and when you know the advice from the sector is that electricity costs will increase.</span>

We are accounting for the fact that that is likely to be passed on to consumers by ensuring that there is reasonable provision, through tax cuts, increased pensions and increased payments. I would also point out that this government is investing many millions of dollars in increasing the efficiency of irrigation, and has done far more on that—consistent with Mr Turnbull's policy; I will, again, give credit where credit is due. I am sure you were very pleased when that was announced as your policy, as well. We are very keen to improve the efficiency of irrigation. The programs that we have in place—that you never had in place—demonstrate that.</span>

I have had some concerns raised with me, because when the government introduced the $900 cheques during the global financial crisis there was a spike in the sale of plasma TVs and other goods emanating from China. It is quite a perverse outcome of the carbon tax as we see things being bought from China. And there was also an increase of money spent in the clubs at the time of the $900 cheque. </span>

What we saw from your leader and Mr Hockey on the IMF was outright xenophobia. The debate that you engage in in relation to carbon, which constantly goes on about China and India, I think is beneath you. You may as well join One Nation. Seriously! I and other senators in this place who have very clear views on this are really tired of this debate. I do not agree with you, Senator Nash, in your policy on climate. I disagree; I think it is wrong, but I respect that that is your position. I do not respect the way you continue to reference goods made in China and pollution in China. What world do you think we live in? It is just extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also make the point that the senator dismissed the stimulus package and the household component of that. The advice from Treasury, which Dr Henry has referenced, was to ensure that there was an early stimulus in the household sector. That was a key aspect of the government's stimulus package which kept this country out of recession and which ensured that some 200,000 Australians, who would have been on the dole queues, are not. So you might want to dismiss it as simply buying goods made in China—keep saying that; I am sure you will—but it was an important stimulus package in terms of making sure the economy did not slip into recession. We actually think we should manage the economy in order to benefit working Australians and to protect jobs. In relation to the detail of the question, household assistance will initially involve an increase in payments of, I am advised, 1.7 per cent, with a lump-sum clean energy advance paid in May and June 2012. This will provide certainty to households that they are being assisted, even before the carbon price starts, and it will help them to get ready for the carbon price. The advance will enable householders to improve the energy efficiency of their homes if they wish and to reduce their energy expenditure in ways that may not be possible without a lump-sum financial boost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am advised the clean energy advance payment will cover a period of six, nine or 12 months depending on the payment category. Most pensioners and allowees will receive one advance covering a nine-month period from July 2012 to March 2013. Family tax benefit recipients will receive an advance covering the 12 months from July 2012 to July 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, Senator, there has been some suggestion by the opposition that it would be a payment covering 18 months. I am advised that is not correct. I understand that one single advance will not cover 18 months; however, some recipients will receive two advances. These include individuals such as students on youth allowance. They will receive two advances, one which covers the 12 months from July 2012 to July 2013 and another which covers the six-month period from July 2013 to January 2014. The different coverage of these advances reflects the different indexation periods for government payments. If people transfer to a different rate of government payment during the period covered by the advance, they may be eligible for an immediate top-up payment of their advance. This will ensure that no-one will be disadvantaged if their circumstances change after they have received their advance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People will start receiving fortnightly clean energy supplements along with their regular government payments immediately after the end of the period covered by their advance payment. The payment of the advance and then the supplements will ensure there will be no period in which relevant Australian households are not assisted with the impact of a carbon price.</span>

The minister might not see that, but it is entirely up to her to view things in the way that she sees fit. The Australian people know that the emissions in China are growing at a rapid rate, so goods purchased from China are coming from a country with a much greater rate of increase in emissions than is the case in this country. It is as simple as that, and it is a fair point to make. Can I ask the minister in terms of compensation—</span>

What I am very interested in, though, is that on a day-to-day basis we are not going to know what the price is going to be because it is going to fluctuate. As colleagues will know, this is going to become the product of paper pushers and traders. We are going to have a fluctuating price, so we will not know what it is going to be from day to day. I am interested in whether the minister could enlighten the Senate on the process of the calculation of the compensation that is going to be needed when on a daily basis we may well have a fluctuating price?</span>

I think she is suggesting that the prices will fluctuate. I make the point that in the first three years it is a fixed price, and post that, there will obviously be a market price, and the adequacy of assistance will be assessed each year in the budget context to enable the price to be reflected in terms of the assistance. I also make the point that, as part of the clean energy package, there are some three rounds of tax cuts. These are the ones the senator is going to have to explain to her constituents that she is opposing because her party cannot afford to deliver them, and they really cannot afford to deliver them. If they are telling you that in the party room they are wrong. I would say also that my recollection of the income distribution in regional areas is that there are a lot of people to whom you will have to explain that you are going to make them pay more tax. There are three rounds of tax cuts. What the government has committed to ensures that there will be assistance to cover the projected impact of a carbon price out to the end of the decade. In 2011-12, the effective tax-free threshold moves to $16,000, in 2012-13 to $20,542 and in 2015-16 to $20,979. The government has already committed to tax cuts to provide assistance to cover the projected impact of a carbon price out to the end of the decade. I again emphasise: household assistance payments and tax cuts will be ongoing and will be permanent. Clean energy payments will be indexed to the CPI, which means they will keep pace with the cost of living, including the CPI impact of any further changes to the carbon price. I am sorry, I think I said three rounds of tax cuts; I should have said two.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I have a number of questions of vital interest to Northern and remote Australia, an area for which I have portfolio responsibility for the coalition. I also have questions about the impact of the carbon tax on the Defence Force, for which I also have a small role in opposition. Unfortunately, I am going to have to confine myself to about half an hour of questions because a lot of my colleagues have a lot of questions to ask and because the Greens and the Labor Party have got together to curtail debate on these bills. We were promised the whole of this week. We came back specially for this additional sitting week for a whole week of questions on the carbon tax bills, but the Greens with their normal antidemocratic approach have joined with the Labor Party to curtail debate on these 18 bills, which will now finish at lunchtime tomorrow. Here we are, being absolutely curtailed, because the Greens have no interest in free speech. In fact, the Greens and the Labor Party get people up here to filibuster. They do not ask a question, they just fill in what limited time there is by getting people up to make pathetically inaccurate and puerile speeches in the committee stage of the debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister takes sensitive issue when we mention that China is the biggest emitter of carbon in the world. Why do we mention it? Not because we are anti-China; we love China. Why do we mention that India is a big emitter? Not because we do not like India; we love India. In fact, we would like to sell them some uranium. We mention it because they are two of the very biggest emitters, and neither of them is doing anything like this nationwide, economy-wide carbon tax on coal that will impact on their industries. They are not doing it, because they do not want it to impact on their industry. We mention often that the United States is also a big emitter of greenhouse gases, but it is not going to do anything. Even Canada, an emitter a bit like Australia, has made it clear that it is not going to do anything like this nationwide carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will mention my questions briefly, so the advisers can be a little bit prepared, because I do not think I will get a chance to ask them in detail before the dinner break. My questions are about proposed section 145 of the main bill, in relation to the coal industry. I will ask some questions about the coal industry, because it is such an important industry to Northern Australia, including Northern Queensland, and because so many jobs in the coal industry are at risk because of this carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will ask some detailed questions about the sugarcane industry, which is also a very important industry to Northern Australia and which is a paramount industry in the area of the Burdekin in North Queensland, where I come from. I am not sure if the minister has ever been there, but if she had she would know that the Burdekin grows the very best sugar cane in the world. Why? Because it is a dry area in the tropics. There is lots of sunshine, but they irrigate very heavily from underground with electric pumps. I would like the minister to tell me later on, and I will be more detailed with the question, exactly what modelling has been done, insofar as the sugarcane industry is concerned, about the huge increase to their cost of production that will occur because of the increase in the cost of electricity. At the moment, fortuitously, the sugar industry is doing okay—world prices are pretty good at the moment—but we remember when, only 10 years ago, the Commonwealth had to put in a $440 million rescue package to save the industry because prices were rock bottom. If that happens with this increase in electricity prices you are going to wipe out a lot of the economy of North Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will ask the minister, again because it is of such importance to North Queensland, Northern Australia and remote Australia, about the impact of the carbon tax on the tourism industry. We know that electricity prices are going to go up. We also know that the cost of freight is going to go up when the carbon tax applies to the big trucks that take goods and services into the more remote parts of Australia. The tourism industry is going to be slugged, but it does not seem to be in line for any compensation packages such as the $300 million assistance package given to the steel industry. Why does the steel industry get some favourable treatment but not the tourism industry, which is so important?</span>

Bear in mind that two out of three will receive assistance at least equivalent to the average price impact. So the government has already built that buffer in to reflect the potential for some difference in the price impact from what would be assumed as a result of the Treasury modelling. This is analogous in many ways to the way the impact of the GST on prices was calculated.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:33</span>):  Just before the dinner break, I was halfway through asking some questions of the minister. I was lamenting the fact that, because of an unholy deal between the Greens and the Labor Party, the time for asking questions has been severely curtailed so that this whole process has to finish by lunchtime tomorrow. Temporary Chairman Marshall, you would recall that we have come back to the Senate this week—the House of Representatives is not sitting; this is an additional week, over and above the parliamentary sitting—so that we can fully explore these 18 complex bills. But we are being severely restricted by this arrangement between the Greens and their mates in GetUp!—none of whom have any interest in democracy, free speech or proper parliamentary debate—in an unholy alliance with the Labor Party. As a result of that, my colleagues and I have very limited time to speak on these bills and to get the information the Australian public need to fully understand and comprehend this toxic new tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have given the minister's advisers some idea of the questions that I am going to ask, so I hope that they will be well-prepared to brief the minister when I do ask the questions. Senator Birmingham and Senator Xenophon have moved a very substantial amendment that I want to spend a couple of minutes supporting. It is an amendment that says that this package of bills should not be implemented, should not be approved by the Governor-General, until after the next election. For those listening, I want to explain why we are moving this amendment. It is because nearly every member in the lower house ran to the last election on a campaign promise that there would be no carbon tax under a government led by Ms Gillard. It was a solemn promise by Ms Gillard a couple of days before the last election and it was reinforced by the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, Wayne Swan. 'There will be no carbon tax in this term of government.' </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course here we are in the closing stages of debate—though much truncated—on legislation which will impose a toxic Australia-wide carbon tax. We live in hope that some of the Labor people might do what their constituents want them to do and come across and join us in opposing this toxic tax. I know many of them would like to. Many understand that their colleagues in the House of Representatives will be annihilated at the next election because of the breach of that solemn promise and because Australians clearly do not want this toxic carbon tax, particularly when nobody else in the world has one. This tax will do nothing to stop global emissions from Australia. In fact, after this enormous new tax is imposed, on the government's own modelling, emissions are going to increase by 2020. It is not going to do any good at all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the Labor Party are all saying now that this is an essential tax for Australia, that it is essential Australia leads the world in introducing a nationwide carbon tax. I want to ask every one of the members of the Labor Party—and I want them to answer this when next they speak—what did they say to Ms Gillard a year ago? They are all saying the tax is so good now. Did they pick up the phone to Ms Gillard and say: 'Don't you dare do this, Ms Gillard. You've just promised you won't introduce a carbon tax, but we think it's so good.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong has been speaking for the last week on how good and how essential a carbon tax is for Australia. I would like to know what Senator Wong did a year ago when Ms Gillard promised the Australian people she was not going to introduce it. Did Senator Wong ring Ms Gillard and say: 'Hey, buddy, this is not on. This tax is so good.' Senator Wong has been telling us for the last week how good this all is. I would be interested to know, if she thinks it is so good now, whether she rang Ms Gillard a year ago, when Ms Gillard promised every Australian she would not be introducing this tax, and said: 'Listen, buddy, you're wrong. You can't do this. I'm not going to go with you. I'm not going to run on your campaign promises. I'm going to make my own comments. I'm going to tell the Australian people, "No, I'm for a carbon tax."'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about all of the other senators here? I want to know whether Kirsten Livermore, the member for Capricornia, rang Ms Gillard a year ago and said: 'I believe this carbon tax is just so good. If you're going to promise not to do it, if you've said you're not going to have it, I'm going to campaign against you.' I want all the Labor members to search their souls and tell me: did they ring Ms Gillard a year ago when she promised not to introduce this tax? I would be very interested in the answers. I am sure it did not happen. Or perhaps they rang her and Ms Gillard said to them: 'Look, I've had to promise this because I know people hate it and if I said we were for it then we wouldn't get elected. I agree with you that we should have a carbon tax, so just shut up for the next couple of days. Don't say anything. We'll pretend we are not going to have a carbon tax. As soon as we get in, we'll introduce the carbon tax.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard a lot of comments in this chamber about how John Howard changed his mind on the GST, and I concede that, yes, he did. He had said we were not going to have a GST, but then he prepared a GST—the whole tax system. He put it out, chapter and verse, line by line, detail by detail, to the Australian public and then he said to the Australian public: 'Look, previously I said there wouldn't be a GST. Now I think we do need a GST, so this is what I propose. I'm now going to go to an election. If you agree with me that this GST is good for Australia then vote for me at the election. If you don't believe it's good, vote for the Labor Party.' What did Australians do? They returned John Howard and he introduced the GST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment by Senator Xenophon and Senator Birmingham simply says: 'Have the courage to do what John Howard did. If you think this is so good, if you think this is going to save the world, put it to the Australian people. Let them have a say.' If this amendment is passed, that is what will happen. The confirmation of this new policy regime will start only after the next election, and what could be fairer than that? I would like anyone to tell me what could be fairer than that. Even under the Labor Party's proposals, the Greens' proposals, this does not start till 1 July next year, so there is no hurry. I cannot understand why we are guillotining it through the Senate tonight and having a couple of hours tomorrow morning on these 18 complex bills, because it does not start for another seven months at the very earliest. What is the rush? We know why: Senator Brown and Ms Gillard want to go to South Africa and strut the world stage saying, 'We've done this.' All the other countries will simply laugh at them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly support this amendment. Senator Xenophon has some interesting amendments on another approach to carbon reduction, and they deserve full debate. But I can tell Senator Xenophon that he is not going to get the time. You have got literally a couple of hours tonight and a couple of hours tomorrow. About 15 speakers from our party want to speak, and all we get is Labor Party people jumping up, giving 15-minute speeches and stopping us from even asking questions. This whole thing is a travesty of parliamentary democracy, and I hope that those listening to this debate will understand just how low the Labor Party and the Greens have sunk. With the Greens we would expect it, but most people expect that the Labor Party, when they made a solemn promise not to do something, would honour it. Sadly, that is not the case.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as supporting the amendment, I want now to go to the questions I foreshadowed before. I ask questions about the coal industry because it is so important in Queensland, the state I represent in this chamber. Proposed section 145 of the main bill contains a clause that permanently locks coalmining out of the traditional assistance arrangements regardless of future market conditions or the outcome of any Productivity Commission reviews of the effectiveness and scope of the emissions-intensive trade-exposed arrangement. This is a dramatic shift from the previous CPRS legislation, introduced by Mr Rudd but withdrawn. I ask the minister: why this change of approach? Why is the coal industry being attacked in this way?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, in relation to the coal industry, there is $1.68 billion for the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships Program—nowhere near the 13.2 billion committed to renewable technologies—and another $3.2 billion managed by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. At least $1.68 billion is something. Treasury modelling of the Clean Energy Future package acknowledges that carbon capture and storage will make an important contribution to meeting Australia's emissions reduction target. Its exclusion from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is clearly inconsistent with this funding. Carbon capture and storage should have the same access to a competitive process for this funding as the suite of other low-emission and renewable technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the minister to explain to me why the government has taken this approach with the carbon tax in relation to those two issues. I would appreciate the minister's answers. Then I want to ask a couple of questions about the tourism and sugarcane industries. Regrettably, that will be the only time I will have to participate in this debate tonight, even though I have literally thousands of other questions. Perhaps the minister could address those two questions in relation to the coal industry.</span>

I believe the process is unsatisfactory, but the longer I talk about how unsatisfactory and unfair it is, the less time I will have to move the amendments I need to move, which have been on the table for quite some time and which are worthy of debate, relating to significant and substantial amendments to the bill. I wonder could the coalition indicate whether they would be prepared, once the minister has responded to Senator Macdonald's substantial questions, to have a vote on this very worthy amendment—which I have co-sponsored with Senator Birmingham—that these bills be delayed until after the next election. Even if I dealt as efficiently as possible with my amendments, it would take me the best part of an hour. So I indicate that I am keen for this question to be put in the next 25 to 30 minutes. The incredible time constraints are not exactly fair, given that we should be debating this very important piece of legislation for at least the rest of the week. Given all that, I flag to my colleagues that I am very keen for this particular question to be put in the next 25 minutes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  To answer Senator Xenophon, as everyone in this chamber knows, Senator Birmingham is leading the case for the coalition and is in charge of managing the very limited time allowed to those of us on this side of the chamber. I cannot answer your question Senator Xenophon. I assume that would be his approach, but he will indicate that to you the moment he comes into the chamber, which I am sure will not be very long. In light of that, I have been here long enough to know who is going to get the call next. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as the two questions I have asked on carbon, I might put to the minister my questions on the tourism and sugarcane industries. Hopefully the minister can wrap them all up and at least give some information to those industries. In relation to the sugar cane industry, senators and those listening to this will recall that Senator Nash gave a very detailed explanation of irrigation. Where I come from, the Burdekin district of North Queensland, we grow the best sugar cane in the world. Why? We have lots of sunshine and very little rain but the cane grows magnificently because it is irrigated by underground water. Pumping the water out of the aquifer requires a lot of energy, and the bills for electricity for sugarcane farmers in the Burdekin district are astronomical. I want to know from the minister what assistance sugarcane growers can expect with what is almost their single greatest cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While on the subject, I refer the minister to the Army's Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, a huge establishment and the home for many of Australia's very professional defence forces. There is magnificent work done there. Our soldiers most often leave from there to go to Afghanistan and Iraq. These days, unlike the old days, the soldiers all have air-conditioned barracks. The work being done out there on new buildings is astronomical. I have asked on notice—and I do not have the answer from the government yet: what is the electricity bill for Lavarack Barracks? I do not expect the minister to have an answer to that, but I can tell you that it will be enormous, in the tens of millions of dollars a year. I await the government's answer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What additional funds will go to the Australian defence forces to pay for the increased cost of electricity which they will have to pay civilian suppliers? The defence forces are already under the pump, having to save $20 billion under the Labor Party's regime. That means there is less fuel for planes, ships and tanks, and fewer bullets to fire in training. I would like to know what plans the government has to increase funding to the defence forces to pay for the increased cost of electricity. Finally, I would like to ask the minister what programs are going to be put in place to help the defence industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard Labor Party speaker after Labor Party speaker say we have got to have this tax because it is the only way we can save the Great Barrier Reef and, if we do not save the Barrier Reef, the tourism industry is going to be in trouble. I think anyone listening to this broadcast will know that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of world emissions of carbon. Under the government's proposal, they are going to reduce that by five per cent. So that is five per cent of 1.4 per cent. You can work out the arithmetic yourself, and it is not much. We have asked, time and time again, what that is going to do for world emissions and, therefore, the stopping of climate change. I have always said the climate is changing. Of course, as everyone knows, it has been changing for millions of years. Remember that we used to be covered in ice once. The centre of Australia was once a rainforest. Of course, the climate changes. It has been changing for eons and will continue to change for eons. But I want to know what the reduction of Australia's 1.4 per cent of world emissions by five per cent will do to do that is going to save the Barrier Reef. If China, the United States, Canada or India do nothing, if the Europeans say they are doing nothing and effectually do nothing, and if none of the other developing countries are doing anything, then what is Australia's five per cent of 1.4 per cent going to do to save the world and to save the Barrier Reef?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What it will do is put up the costs of every tourism operator on the Barrier Reef, and it will put them out of business. What Australia does is not going to make one iota of difference to the Barrier Reef or indeed to emissions or to global warming—if there is global warming. It will certainly not make any difference to the climate change that has been happening for 20 million years, but it will affect the industries very prominent and very important up in North Queensland, where I come from. Thousands of small businesses up along the coast of Queensland and north of Bundaberg rely on the Barrier Reef. This tax is going to destroy their business because they are not getting any relief. They use a lot of diesel but the diesel tax credit is going, as I understand it. Labor's carbon tax will not do a thing to save the Barrier Reef but it will destroy the businesses of all those tourism operators.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great Barrier Reef goes up into the Torres Strait and the islands. I also want to know what packages the government is going to put together for all of those people who live in remote areas of Australia and who only get their goods and services by the trucks, planes and ships that bring the goods in. Most of those use fuel that is not going to be in any way assisted, so we have this double whammy in remote and distant Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would be interested in answers to those questions. The minister has indicated she has some comprehensive answers, because I have given her notice before the dinner break of these and I would be very keen to hear them. I conclude by saying for those who are listening to this broadcast—and I know a lot of people do listen to the broadcast of parliament because they like to know how democracy works and how this parliament of Australia works—</span>

Much as I would like to ask the dozens and dozens of other questions that I have, I am not going to be given the chance because of this very truncated, undemocratic guillotining of this debate.

                    </a>  I listened to you in silence, Senator. I would ask that you give me the same courtesy. There was also lengthy reiteration of past matters. I do not propose to respond to them. The only point I would make is that, first, the opposition has the same reduction target by 2020. So if the senator does not believe it is sensible for Australia to be reducing its emissions by five per cent by 2020, on 2000 levels, he should take that up with Tony Abbott. The differ­ence is that the policy that the senator supports will cost the taxpayers who elect him more than the government's policy. It will cost taxpayers more each year—$1,300 without assistance in a picking winners, doling out grants program that is bureaucrati­cally driven. I have placed on record a number of times in this debate why we on this side of the chamber believe it is important to price carbon, both in terms of moving the Australian economy to being a cleaner energy economy and also responding to the challenge of climate change, a position that is not remarkable; it is a position that Mr Turnbull shared, that Mr Howard shared and that the Conservatives in the United Kingdom share. I think Margaret Thatcher was one of the first world leaders to talk about climate change. So these are not radical positions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked some specific questions. Firstly, I would make a few points on sugarcane. I understand this was raised in some of the committee discussion—although maybe not. The agricultural sector is exclu­ded from coverage under the carbon pricing mechanism. Sugarcane farming will not be directly liable to purchase permits under this mechanism. In addition, the government has agreed to exclude fuel used in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. I am also advised that the sugarcane industry may be able to generate credits under the Carbon Farming Initiative which will be linked to the carbon pricing mechanism by, for example, reducing burning of the above-ground biomass of the sugarcane crop, reducing fertiliser use and sequestering carbon in soils. A number of inputs to farming, such as fertilising chemi­cals, are priced in international markets and therefore unlikely to rise significantly with a carbon price. The government is providing assistance to producers of fertilising chemi­cals through the Jobs and Competitiveness Program because they are not expected to be able to pass through their carbon costs. Manufacturers of urea, a key input to fertiliser production, will be eligible for assistance under the Jobs and Competitive­ness Program at the 66 per cent assistance level. Manufacturers will also be eligible for assistance under the $1.2 billion clean energy program. This includes $150 million dedicated to manufacturers in the food and beverage processing sector as part of the Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated to Senator Nash previously, Treasury modelling indicates that electricity prices may rise by about 10 per cent under a carbon price. However, I would note, as I previously indicated, that ABARES has estimated that electricity makes up about 0.9 per cent of total input costs for broadacre farming, even assuming full cost pass-through by electricity suppliers. This implies a very small impact on total production costs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the long run, the proposed carbon tax policy provides opportunities to Mackay Sugar. … in the longer term, a carbon price is likely to promote diversification projects for our business. As a large sugar manufacturer, Mackay Sugar generates considerable quantities of renewable energy using by-products of the annual cane crop. … under the proposed carbon tax Mackay Sugar will be largely exempt from direct greenhouse gas emission liabilities. Also, a carbon price will drive our business to improve overall energy efficiencies and reduce the use of supplementary coal fuel at our factories.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to tourism, I make the point that, first, international aviation is not subject to a carbon price. I know from the number of questions that I have been asked in question time that the senator might not have recalled that. The domestic industry is subject to a carbon price. That has been factored into the cost-of-living impact of 0.7 per cent to which I referred earlier and which forms the basis of the Household Assistance Package. I also reference the effect on the tourism industry—for example, the Great Barrier Reef—of climate change, just to remind us that there are economic costs to climate change to which we need to have regard.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to coal, I have answered a number of questions previously from the senator. We do not believe that it is appropriate to classify coalmining as emissions-intensive trade-exposed because most Australian coalmines do not release a great deal of pollution per tonne of coal produced and are expected to face relatively minor cost impacts in the carbon price. The policy issue is a small number of underground mines which are extremely gassy, which have high volumes of fugitive emissions. I have gone through—I think on Thursday—the assistance that the government is providing to this sector. I also make the point that, despite the sorts of scare campaigns that the senator has been part of, we continue to see increasing investment in the coal industry, including a takeover bid on the day that Mr Abbott suggested that this was the death of the coal industry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also asked about CCS. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is intended to deliver investment into renewable energies and low-pollution technologies such as co-generation. This is in addition to the government's existing support for clean coal technologies, which will continue to be delivered through our existing programs, which include the CCS Flagships Program and the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to defence, Senator, the government does fund defence. The 'enormous cost' that you are talking about would be, obviously, the electricity price increase, to which I have already referred. I note that the defence budget in 2011-12 was some $26 billion, so I suggest that we perhaps should keep in context the additional electricity costs.</span>

Given the time constraints, I refer to Minister Combet's media release of 16 September. He refers to Treasury modelling showing that the average price impact on health services will be around 0.3 per cent. Is this taken into account in the government's Household Assistance Package? Also, that reference appears to be in the committee's interim report. Can you tell me where in the Treasury modelling documents this information relating to the 0.3 per cent appears? How was that figure calculated, and how much is it in dollar terms? Is that per household, doctors surgery or hospital clinic? Will there be any effect on the price of medicines manufactured in Australia? Those are two separate questions, one relating to the services and one relating to the medicines manufactured.</span>

What Senator Macdonald missed when talking about the science was that in the current Holocene—that is, the present warm period that we are in—a lot of the change in the climate has been caused by humans. That is why we are in the situation we are in and why we are trying to do something about it. According to Professor Will Steffen, one of the climate commissioners, one trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is of human origin. That means something like 30 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been caused by humans. Yes, the climate has changed, and it has changed because of our contribu­tion to it. That is why we are trying to do something about it. That is why we are trying to ensure that our climate and our ecosyst­ems—including the Great Barrier Reef, which Senator Macdonald touched on—are protected into the future and that our ecosystems remain in the equilibrium in which they need to remain. </span>

In the meantime, they are actually doing something about this issue; they are acting. Even India and China are acting on the issue of carbon in the atmosphere. </span>

Does he actually believe in doing something about it that would lead to a low-carbon future in this country? In relation to being in committee and the opposition having an opportunity to ask questions, the opposition have wasted so much time on not asking questions. They are not getting into the detail of the clauses in these bills because they have not done their homework. They do not understand the degree of detail in these bills so they have chosen to gloss over the in committee stage by frivolously grandstanding and giving second reading speeches rather than getting into the nitty-gritty of what we are here for, which is to look at the detail of how these bills will work in reality when they become legislation tomorrow.</span>

If we do not try and reduce carbon pollution, the world risks serious effects from climate change. He seems not to care about the rest of the world, only Australia. Therefore, it does not matter that other parts of the world are not acting as fast as they should be—and, in light of that, Australia should not be acting. But Australia itself faces acute risks from not acting on climate change. Australia is a very hot and dry continent. This means that, among the world's developed countries, Australia itself faces acute risks. Studies have indicated that warming of more than two degrees Celsius will overwhelm the capacity of many of the natural ecosystems in Australia to adapt. With that level of warming, for instance, the survival of the Great Barrier Reef, which Senator Macdonald referred to earlier—</span>

                    </a>  As I said earlier, regardless of the fact that carbon pollution has an effect on the entire planet, Australia itself is at acute risk. If it is only Australia that those opposite care about in relation to this issue then at least for the sake of Australia they should be supporting the bills in front of them, because Australia, the Great Barrier Reef and the ecosystems in this hot and dry continent are at grave risk if we do not act. I support that by again going back to Professor Will Steffen, the director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, who has provided on umpteen occasions a lot of peer reviewed evidence as to why we need to be acting on climate change and why we need to be giving incentive to those large polluters to change their current practices to, in effect, change our economy, the same as has already been done in the EU and a number of other parts of the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer those senators opposite to the Climate Commission's website because it talks about carbon pricing being not a new concept but something that has been in place in parts of the world for a number of years. In fact, in the US, when they were dealing with acid rain back in the mid-1990s, they introduced a price on acid rain pollution, which was passed in 1995, to reduce sulfur dioxide pollution from power plants. The pollution dropped by three million tonnes by 2002. That is a clear example of how putting a price on pollution does actually work and how it has already worked in another part of the world. This is not a new thing. The opposition are making it a bigger deal than it really is. Yes, it is a major piece of reform for this nation, but it is something that so many parts of the world are acting on and getting on with. Why? It is because they believe in the science. I think the stumbling block here comes back to the fact that those senators opposite do not believe in the science and they do not believe in what those peer reviewed science reports are telling us.</span>

I know he said earlier that he does believe in climate change, but I do not know what that actually means. I think it means that he just believes the climate changes and we all keep rolling along. He does not believe that human input has something to do with—</span>

It is necessary also to remind the opposition that the overall architecture of the clean energy package is similar to the emissions trading scheme that the coalition, under the direction of John Howard, once were in favour of and supportive of. To come in here and continue to be so negative and fear mongering and misleading in relation to the package in front of you has to be for no other reason than for political gain, for gain in the poll, for trying to ensure that you are misleading the public in the hope of votes rather than actually standing for anything on principle or standing for anything of meaning when it comes to this important piece of reform.</span>

                    </a>  This is very disciplined from the opposition! I am not quite sure to whom I respond. If the senator is offended I will withdraw that, but I do make the point that I gave her the courtesy, as I try to, of indicating that I had an answer on the specific question and instead I got some diatribe about process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the question about the 0.3 per cent, I am advised that detail on that is available on the Treasury website. There is a note entitled 'The impact of a carbon price on household expenditure as modelled by the Treasury for the Clean Energy Future package announced on 10 July 2011 by the government'. That note sets out a more detailed breakdown of Treasury's modelling of the impact of a carbon price via CPI subgroup. If you turn to table 1, that table shows a range of the CPI subgroups, and included in that is health services, average price impact per week, and I have here 10c—I will just check that that is right—which is 0.3 per cent. So, in response to the senator's question, that is the locus that that figure came from. I think that is the basis of the assertions, to which she was referring, by the minister I represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also make the point, and I suspect the senator would recall this better than I in relation to public hospitals, which I think she asked about, that the government's funding of public hospitals is subject to indexation arrangements. Senator Sinodinos is nodding. I do not have anyone in the advisers box to recall precisely the rate of indexation but my recollection is that it is significantly above CPI because health costs obviously rise above CPI, and if I am incorrect in that I will come back to you. To the extent that there is any increase in costs from the carbon price I am advised that current and future funding arrangements would automatically ensure that public hospitals continue to be properly funded within the arrangements.</span>

The other part of that question was about the effect on the price of medicines manufactured in Australia. They were the health questions. I then have some aged-care questions.</span>

I am not sure that there is any further disaggregation than the CPI subgroup to which I referred. The health services CPI subgroup includes hospital and medical services, optical services and dental services, and the price impact was the 0.3 per cent average price impact per week of 10c. Obviously that is a consumer impact, so that is not an institutional impact. I have information in the CPI subgroup of pharmaceuticals. I will seek advice as to whether there is any disaggregation that is available as between those domestically and internationally produced and manufactured. The CPI subgroup for pharmaceuticals is also 0.3 per cent and the average price impact is here as less than 10c a week.</span>

With respect to aged care, operators have had concerns in relation to residents. In your figures on residential aged care in Australia there are two different figures in relation to operational residential places, one of $182,850 and another of $179,749. For the purposes of, say, about 180,000 in residential aged-care facilities, can you explain to me if increasing the pensioner contribution to providers from 84 per cent to 85 per cent will cover the increased cost for providers? Could you tell me what modelling was used? When will it be reviewed and will aged-care homes be counted as a single residence? There are, on your figures, 2,772 aged-care facilities. Will they each be counted as a single resi­dence? How has the calculation been done?</span>

I will see if there is anybody here who can assist. But, in relation to aged care, you would be aware that the package includes amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997 to allow a portion of the clean energy payments paid to eligible residents in residential care to flow to providers. This will enable providers who meet some of their residents' costs of daily living to meet the increased costs relating to the carbon price. The arrangement will ensure that household assistance is shared fairly between residents and providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the senator pointed out, the maximum standard resident contribution payable by most eligible residents of aged-care homes will increase from 84 per cent to 85 per cent of the total basic pension amount. This increase will mean that aged-care homes will receive 52 per cent of the clean energy payments and pensioners will retain 48 per cent of their clean energy payments. The basic daily fee will remain the same for non-pensioner residents of aged-care homes who do not hold a Commonwealth seniors health card and who will not receive clean energy payments. Instead a new government aged-care supplement equal to one per cent of the basic pension will be payable in respect to these residents. I will see if there is any information I can provide in relation to the last issue and come back to the senator on it.</span>

One hundred and ten thousand pensioners and concession card holders who use lifesaving equipment will get $140 extra a year each to help pay for the high cost of electricity. That divided by 52 is $2.70 per week. Does the calculation take into account how much it costs to operate a dialysis machine at home every week? Can you tell me what modelling was used to calculate that $140? Was it Treasury modelling? If not, what other modelling was it and which document does it appear in? I am also interested in people with other conditions that do not require special equipment but who may need extra heating and cooling because of an inability to control body temperature—for example, people with Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis. What is their position? How soon after the carbon tax is introduced will this subsidy be reviewed? Are the calculations that have been done—for example, on the issue of dialysis—on the basis of the number of people in hospitals today?</span>

In relation to your question on single residences, I am not sure that is a term that we are familiar with in this context. It may be a term that is in the Aged Care Act; I am not sure. But the advice I have is that providers will receive a proportion of the clean energy payment of each resident. I do not know if that assists, Senator.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the essential medical equipment payment, the government has made a decision to put in place a payment of $140. This is to cover the change in running costs due to a carbon price of a kidney dialysis machine, which is the highest energy use machine expected to be covered by the payment. It is paid in addition to any state or territory government rebate or subsidy for essential medical equipment or thermoregu­latory dysfunction. It has been designed to cover the additional cost impact of running medical equipment over and above the existing cost, which is subsidised through state schemes. The payment will be available for people with medical needs, or their carers, who are covered by an eligible concession card, require equipment or additional heating or cooling in their home as a result of a medical condition and hold, or contribute to the payment of, an energy account. It is not intended to provide assistance for the full operating costs of life-support machines. Rather, it is intended, as I said, to assist with increases in the running costs of life-support equipment due to the carbon price. It is also targeted at those who are most in need, hence those people covered by a concession card.</span>

However, equipment eligible for a rebate or subsidy under a state or territory scheme as at 30 June 2011 will be included. I have a number of other points but I do not think they are relevant. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I say—I see the senator rising—that the government would like to vote on the amendment before the chair. The government is quite happy to do so. I am very happy to continue answering questions, but the failure of the committee to vote on a single amendment, having sat all of the day plus four hours on Thursday, says something about the way in which the opposition are choosing to conduct this debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be ruthlessly efficient with these amendments because I know time is incredi­bly short. These amendments introduce a target reduction of emissions to 10 per cent less than 2000 levels by 2020. Under the government's legislation, the only specified target is a reduction to 80 per cent below 2000 levels by 2050, but we have heard earlier today that the amendments will lead to a five per cent target by 2020. It is important to note that this target is more ambitious than the government's own target. It is important to note that this target is based on modelling undertaken by Frontier Economics, commissioned by me and the opposition back in 2009, showing that there is an alternative approach that is more economically efficient and can achieve this target of 10 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, it is very important that any legislation that is of this significance to the economy must be dealt with in the context of giving the people of Australia a say on this issue. That is a non-negotiable position, from my point of view. But it is also important that we have a debate about the policy. My concern is that the coalition's Direct Action Plan just does not do that. It is a simplistic plan that will not deliver the best outcome in terms of reducing greenhouse gases and doing so in the most economically efficient way. An intensity based scheme will see economic cost savings because the scheme will result in lower energy price rises, and this will make the low-carbon transition more acceptable to consumers. Furthermore, through a range of additional efficiency initiatives, the Renewable Energy Target and a white certificate scheme, which I have amendments to introduce to establish, I believe that having a higher target will actually drive investment and drive supplementary emissions reduction targets to support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a criticism, but I think it is interesting to note that, when this was being debated two years ago, the Greens moved for an unambiguous 25 per cent cut by 2020. I did not support that; I did support a 20 per cent cut based on Frontier Modelling data. But I think it is important to note that right now all this bill will deliver is a five per cent cut by 2020, and that to me is not satisfactory. I also want to make the follow­ing points. Frontier Economics used the same modellers, the Monash University Centre of Policy Studies, and the same model, the Monash Multi-Regional Forecast­ing model. What has been modelled here means less impact on small businesses. The problem is that you have a situation where the big end of town, the big emitters, will be compensated but the small and medium enterprises will not. I do not believe the coalition's Direct Action Plan deals with that. We will see a massive spike in electricity prices. We will see enormous uncertainty, and my concern is that, if you do not push up prices as much, you do not need to compensate as much and as such you have less revenue churn, and less revenue churn is the key here to having an efficient scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is also worth noting that recycling involves a tax interaction effect. I would welcome a contribution in this debate from Senator Sinodinos, for instance, who has long experience in issues of policy in his former role as chief of staff to the Prime Minister's office in the Howard government. But I think it is very important that we look at the tax interaction effects. We also need to look at the impact that this will have on the small business sector. The small business sector will be hit very hard by this, and there is a better way of getting a much better outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a fundamental issue. This is, in a sense, a litmus test about having an efficient scheme. The difficulty here is that this scheme involves a combination of carrot and stick. The government scheme seems to involve a lot more stick and less carrot. Once you recycle revenue, you will have distortions in the economy. You will have a situation where you will cause, I believe, significant damage given the design of this scheme, and I think we can do better. The Frontier scheme provides that way forward. I know the coalition will not be supporting it at this stage, but I ask that you keep your options open.</span>

                    </a>  For a brief period they did—thank you, Senator Wong—but they walked away from it. But this is still good policy. Senator Wong admires me for my loyalty and she accuses me of my loyalty to Danny Price of Frontier Economics. But I am loyal to good public policy, and I think it is important that we put this in perspective. In terms of the breadth and magnitude of economic effects, this scheme is arguably the most significant policy change in Australia's history, and as such there is a substantial onus on the government to demonstrate that, whatever policy is introduced, it is the best that can be developed. I believe we have not done that in relation to this scheme. If we look at the distortionary effects of such a scheme and at the impact on taxes then I think we will see a significant flow-on effect on the economy which will be negative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at what the Obama administra­tion proposed at the beginning of this year: having a clean energy standard. That is consistent with the Frontier scheme. That is consistent with a more efficient approach to achieving a better outcome. That is why I would urge my colleagues in the coalition to at least consider this—if not now, some other time. The fact is that the direct action scheme will not cut it. The direct action scheme will not provide the long-term benefits and a much more efficient way of dealing with this policy problem. But, again, I make it clear that I move these amendments against the backdrop of ensuring that the Australian people have a say before any such scheme is implemented.</span>

                    </a>  On the amendments before the chamber that Senator Xenophon has spoken to, the government does not support these amendments. The government does stand by its 2020 target range of five to 15 or 25 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020 on the terms that we have previously indicated. The senator would be aware from earlier discussions that the architecture in this legislation does differ from the CPRS in a number of important respects. The first is in relation to the fixed-price period, which is obviously a three-year period. The second is that these bills create the Climate Change Authority and task it with providing independent advice on pollution caps and carbon budgets that must be considered by the minister administering the legislation when setting the initial and subsequent pollution caps by regulation, which of course are disallowable instruments. I think we have discussed that issue earlier. So, for those reasons, the government will not be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendments.</span>

Since methane is methane, as you stated, do you therefore disagree with the PhD thesis of a number of people from Sydney university who say the multiplier of methane from organic sources is completely different, as far as greenhouse gas emissions go, to that of mineral sources?</span>

Senator Xenophon is moving for that target—for the benefit of people wondering what on earth is going on with the interjections here. The issue is: should we be setting a higher target than five per cent? The point at issue is that one of the problems with the legislation that came before this parliament previously was that the level of ambition on greenhouse gas reduction was too low and in no way met the scientific reality. We all know that Australia has signed on to constrain global warming to less than two degrees above pre-industrial levels. That actually means that we should be aiming to get down below 450 parts per million to 350 parts per million globally, if we are to actually give ourselves an opportunity for a safe climate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The target range that is on the table will be determined by the Climate Change Authority. That is the big advantage and is actually one of the most crucial parts of this whole package: the fact that we are going to set up a Climate Change Authority, which has as its mandate to take into account the latest science, to look at what is happening around the world and to set emission reduct­ion trajectories for the first five years of the scheme, and then annually after that. That is the role of the independent climate authority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, to now say that we are going to give that climate authority a political directive is wrong. The whole point of this is to give the Climate Change Authority the power to make a recommendation consistent with the science. As Professor Schnellnhuber, who was here recently from Germany, said, if the political reality does not match the physical reality then it is useless. That is the problem that we have had to date—that the level of ambition does not match the physical reality of climate change and what we need to do. So the expectation is that the climate authority, taking into account the latest science, will be setting a much steeper trajectory than has ever been projected or talked about in this parliament—and that would certainly be my hope. As to 10 per cent, I do not think it is enough anyway.</span>

                    </a>  No, the government does not have a five per cent target. The government's legislation has five per cent as a default if the parliament has a disallowance for whatever is recommended; otherwise, whatever is recommended stands. The Climate Change Authority will make a recommendation to the government of the day. The government of the day will then make that regulation, and if it does not choose to regulate what the climate authority recommends then it will be forced to explain that. But if it is a default position, with a disallowance, it would be a minimum of five per cent. That is a default position; it is not the position that we would expect to come from the Climate Change Authority. And it needs to be very much higher. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, if you look at the conditions the government previously set for whether it would move to 15 or 25 per cent, I would argue that the conditions for meeting 15 per cent are already there. Most people who have looked at those conditions would argue that. However, having set up a structure which provides for a Climate Change Authority to look at the latest science and to work out that trajectory, I do not think it is appropriate that we then give them a political fix. There is no point in having a Climate Change Authority if you do that. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally in this legislation is the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and ARENA, which will drive renewable energy. In my view—and it is not just my view; it is also the view of ClimateWorks—the invest­ment that is going to come in renewable energy and energy efficiency is going to double the level of emissions reductions from that which Treasury has already modelled and calculated. The expectation is that the emissions reductions will be much more substantial than has been calculated. Further to that, in the package there is a clear undertaking from the government to expedite a white certificate scheme on energy efficiency. That is something that the Greens have had on the table for a long time. Expedite means expedite—to bring that forward. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with those initiatives, I expect that we will see a substantially faster shift because Treasury has been incredibly conservative in its modelling. I think there will be a significant shift once this legislation becomes law and takes effect on 1 July next year. I think the transformation in the economy is going to be a lot faster than people think. In fact, we have to hope that that is the case because the reality of the climate science is that the way the trajectories are currently going, including our own here in Australia for greenhouse gas emissions with business as usual and globally, we are going to reach the point where it will be too late to secure a safe climate. That is the reality that we are all talking about. That is the seriousness of the climate emergency we now face.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to hope that not only will the climate authority take on board the latest science and set a steep trajectory, understanding that the earlier you act, the cheaper it is in the longer term, as Sir Nicholas Stern pointed out very clearly, but also that it leads to a massive investment in renewables and efficiency, much greater gains and therefore an acceleration of the effort that we are able to put in in the economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I am not prepared to vote for something that compromises the whole structure we are trying to set up and that seriously underestimates the level of emissions reduction we need in the time. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pointed out, we needed global emissions to peak and then start coming down by 2015. There is no prospect at this point of global emissions peaking by 2020, and the scientists have now said it needs to happen by—</span>

That is because they put their faith in an independent climate authority on which there are climate scientists. That is precisely what we are hoping will come from the climate authority—that is, for once we will have serious science engaged and serious recommendations made to government where the physical reality and the political reality actually have to meet.</span>

By doing so, you can actually be more ambitious in your targets.</span>

What it means is that emitters are penalised for emissions intensity above the standard, but rewarded if emissions intensity is below the standard. It preserves the same incentive to reduce emissions but it does not raise tax revenue (or electricity prices) in the same way as a tax or a cap and trade on all emissions. This intensity approach is equivalent to introducing a tax on emissions but providing a targeted reduction in a production or company tax—the carbon tax introduces a distortion but the effective reduction in other taxes (by rewarding lower emissions) reduces these distortions and hence the size of the tax interaction effect.</span>

It is about less churn, it is about fewer distortions to the economy and it is about dealing with the tax interaction effect that even Professor Garnaut says needs to be addressed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the issue that Senator Joyce, I think, was raising, I am advised that Australia follows IPCC guidelines to seek global warming potentials for greenhouse gases. The current global warming potential for methane in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Regulations 2008 is set at 21—that is, obviously, a tonne of methane is equivalent to 21 tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span>. The IPCC guidelines currently do not differentiate between different sources of methane when determining global warming potential. I understand the senator is referencing an academic debate about that, a very interesting one no doubt but probably not relevant to the bill before the chamber. The global warming potential of methane from agricultural sources is obviously not relevant to this legislation as agriculture is not covered. I have responded already to Senator Xenophon's amendments and am very happy to vote on them.</span>

It is also terribly relevant when we find people such as Professor John Christy, the atmospheric scientist for the IPCC, saying global temperatures are warming but there is very little we can do about it and the warming is vastly less than predicted. Also, the tangent for the warming is not anywhere near what the initial modelling said it would be. In fact, it is vastly less, which means that they are looking for other sources of how this could interact. All the science has been dutifully left behind by the Labor Party's overwhelming desire to launch a new tax on Australian citizens whether they like it or not. Be that as it may, let us go to other areas which just flummox me.</span>

What exactly do you mean? It is like everything else in this, like every other question I have asked you yesterday and tonight, where you do not have an answer. How can you have may and cannot? It is a non sequitur. It makes no sense. Like everything else in this act, like the idea of cooling the planet from a room in this building, it makes no sense. Nonetheless, let us go on to other things. What is the process of becoming a prescribed international unit?</span>

This is in relation to the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011 and there is a reference in section 3 and onwards relating to prescribed international units. The prescribed international units, as I understand it, Senator—and I will come back to you if my understanding is incorrect—can be used under the Australian system to ensure they are credible. They need to go through a process, and this set of regulation-making powers ensures that there is a process in place which ensures they are credible.</span>

We have heard Senator Xenophon move this amendment and we have heard responses from the government and from the Greens on the amendment. I understand the government's position, which is of course sticking to the five per cent target and wanting to work for international fora. Indeed, there is consistency on that front between the government and the opposition. However, I did hear Senator Milne talk about how, during the CPRS debates, the level of ambition was too low. I remember Senator Milne's contributions then. I think what Senator Milne was seeking at that stage was something along the lines of a 20 or 25 per cent unconditional target by 2020. </span>

Senator Xenophon's amendment is very clear that it would have an object in the act—not necessarily binding but at least it would be a statement of intent—that Australia's net greenhouse gas emissions reductions be at least 10 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. Once upon a time the Greens would have jumped at the opportunity to support an amendment like this. They would have bent over backwards to support this. They would have been amending the amendment to take the 10 per cent to 20 per cent or 30 per cent. But instead, this time around, because we have this sort of mutually captive arrangement happening opposite whereby the Gillard government is held captive by the Greens but equally the Greens seem to be held captive by the Gillard government, the Greens are stymied from speaking up for what they want. Senator Milne keeps coming back to the fact that everything will be determined by the Climate Change Authority. She places great store and puts great stock in her belief that the Climate Change Authority will take out of the hands of the government of the day any real setting of these targets. So I want to seek one reassurance from the minister. I refer the minister to the Climate Change Authority Bill 2011 and, in particular, the proposed section 18 on the appointment of authority members. I would invite the minister to provide an assurance to the Senate in committee that the Australian Greens will in no way, shape or form play any role in the appointment of authority members.</span>

Yes, indeed I note that they are appointments by the climate change minister by written instrument and that the proposed section 18, in division 2, has a very long list of potential fields in which they may have expertise. Let me put the question a different way. Can I have an assurance that the climate change minister or anyone acting on his behalf will not consult with the Australian Greens about who should be appointed to the Climate Change Authority?</span>

The important point is whatever consultation with whomever occurs. There are times, Senator, when we consult with members of your side on appointments. As finance minister, I know that you get to sign off as the co-signatory on a number of appointments. So that is done on occasion. What I can say is that the appointment is a decision for the minister, and generally such appointments would be the subject of the normal cabinet process.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:26</span>):  Of course the reason for going down this path is that Senator Milne is putting such store in the operations of this Climate Change Authority. Senator Milne is willing to oppose a legislative amendment that would encourage greater rates of emissions reductions because she has such faith and such confidence that this Climate Change Authority will clearly do her bidding for her, so will clearly deliver the outcome that the Greens wish to see. I would hope you can understand, Minister, the concern on this side. We are worried about this. If this is to be an independent authority then it should be truly independent. That means it should not be filled with people who come in with positions that the Greens have encouraged so those people share those with the Greens to start with and have predetermined outcomes in mind in any way, shape or form. If this is to be independent then it needs to have absolute integrity surrounding it. So there is genuine concern here that, because the Greens have put such stock in this, they are willing to throw out everything they used to stand for in terms of the types of amendments that they would vote for in this place. They are actually willing to vote against an amendment encouraging higher emissions reductions targets.</span>

                    </a>  It is extraordinary, Senator Ronaldson. It is amazing to think that the Greens would not be voting for higher emissions reductions targets in this chamber and that the only reason that Senator Milne can give is her supreme confidence that this Climate Change Authority will deliver for her. Minister, you, on behalf of the government, reassure us time and time again that the government remains committed to the five per cent reduction target by 2020 and that, of course, there would have to be a change to international circumstances. Well, Senator Milne argues that the international conditions have already been met for a 15 per cent reduction. So, Minister, perhaps firstly you could tell me whether you agree with Senator Milne that the international conditions have already been met for that 15 per cent reduction. Again I invite you to provide a cast-iron assurance to the Senate in committee that the Greens will not be playing a role in the appointment of members to this authority.</span>

The conspiracy theory which I think is being put forward is really a very long bow to draw. I think the government's intentions around appointing people who are independent and have integrity are demonstrated by the appointment of the chair. I understand that the Chief Scientist is also an ex officio member of the authority, and I would assume that the senator would not be suggesting that the Chief Scientist of the country was some sort of mouthpiece for the Greens Party.</span>

If you have a question of Senator Milne, that is a matter that should be addressed to her. The bill before the chamber in terms of the fixed-price period and the default caps references the bipartisan five per cent target. However, there is this architecture, which we are discussing now, which is the Climate Change Authority. I am very happy to continue talking about this. If the senator has nothing further on this point, my invitation to the chamber is that we vote on Senator Xenophon's amendment.</span>

That shows that they are not serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with what the science requires. I once again point out to Senator Birmingham that there is no way you could imagine in your wildest dreams that a five per cent reduction by 2020 would be enough to bring you into constraining global warming to less than two degrees, as Australia has signed on to in international agreements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record that the Greens brought the proposition of the British climate change authority to the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee because we believe that it has worked extraordinarily well in the UK. We looked at the appointments to the Committee on Climate Change there and found eminent people such as Lord Robert May, for example, an Australian who is a former chief scientist who is on that committee. There are other chief scientists. The most eminent people are on that British committee. They take the science seriously and then they provide that scientific advice to the British government. It has worked extremely well as a model in that country not only for setting emission reduction targets but also for overseeing the whole of the climate legislation and the adequacy of that legislation in the UK. It is charged in the UK with advising the government on whether the suite of legislation in that country is enough to deliver on the targets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a different way of addressing greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. It is a way of taking it out of the scientific ignorance that is demonstrated in this place on a regular basis and actually putting some decision making into the hands of those who understand the real emergency that is global warming. As I said, it would be my expectation that a Climate Change Authority that is given a mandate of taking on board the latest science, a trajectory to get us there and a carbon budget to get us there will certainly be recommending very substantial greenhouse gas emission cuts and getting us onto a trajectory that gives us a chance of coming in under what we have agreed to globally. What is more, it will put Australia on the front foot in terms of what will happen when we do get to the point of the globe taking these matters seriously, because Australia will have made a substantial start to transformation—not, as you would have it, in a situation where the maximum you are prepared to commit to is a five per cent reduction, which is nowhere near the physical reality. Your political reality is nowhere near the physical reality that the planet needs.</span>

If you looked at it in isolation in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> you would be forgiven for thinking the Climate Change Authority was going to set emissions reduction targets for the entire world. Of course, its role is to set emissions reduction targets for Australia. Senator Milne talked about the only consideration for the Climate Change Authority to be that of the science. Yes, of course, that is important; but, equally, as we on this side have argued time and time again, that has to be considered in the context of what everybody else is doing. Perhaps to do as Senator Milne has done on occasions in this debate, I will simply refer her to clause 289( 2) of the Clean Energy Bill, which outlines that, whilst the science is a relevant factor for the Climate Change Authority to consider when looking at Australia's future targets, there are a range of factors, not least of which are the economic and social implications associated with various caps. </span>

He is not here but I will put it on the record. I am advised that the levels of the civil penalties in the legislation reflect the seriousness of the contravention and provide disincentives to non-compliance. Most penalties are financial penalties applying to corporations. Executive officers of corpora­tions are only liable if sufficiently culpable. The maximum penalty is 10 years or 10,000 penalty units, and a court will decide what type and level of penalty is appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A large maximum penalty allows for significant penalties to be imposed in the worst cases of deliberate action to, for example, asset strip a company to avoid liability. The provisions are based on the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980, which also has maximum penalties of imprisonment of 10 years. The penalty is also consistent with 10-year imprisonment penalties provided for in the Criminal Code for serious fraud offences such as obtaining financial advantage by deception and conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. </span>

I know the coalition have moved on since that time, but I do ask them to consider whether they acknowledge that the robust modelling of Frontier Economics—the same people who did the Treasury's modelling, the same models used by Treasury—is a scheme that would lead to $47 million in savings for a similar period, until 2020, compared to the government's scheme with a deeper target to be achieved. Can the coalition indicate why they walked away from that, when they had the modelling? They had the work done but they are no longer supporting it. I just want there to be some good public policy here. The coalition know that I support them in opposing this legislation for a whole range of reasons somewhat different perhaps from theirs. To what extent will the coalition revisit the Frontier approach for a longer term policy? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will briefly discuss these amendments. It was touched upon in the debate earlier—Senator Wong is quite correct in relation to that—that these amendments establish an electricity generation benchmark scheme designed to provide incentives to electricity generators to reduce emissions. The purpose of the scheme is to create incentives for the electricity generation sector to reduce emissions and they will not result in the price rises that will occur under the government's carbon price scheme—price rises that small businesses and medium businesses will not be compensated for. The big end of town, the emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries, will be compensated but not the small and medium business sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under these amendments there are provisions for a number of free units to be allocated each year and also for a formula to reduce the number of permits issued under a benchmark for each year until 2030—a formula that has been modelled by Frontier Economics, a formula that has been subject to robust scrutiny and analysis. The implication of this benchmark is that it will preserve the incentives for all generators to reduce emissions, it will reduce the average cost to consumers and it will provide for a smoother transition to an emissions trading scheme, which the government has indicated it will do in three years time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final part of these amendments detail various requirements in compliance provi­sions for the operation of the scheme. In effect, an electricity generation benchmark scheme will bring the government's legisla­tion in line with the Frontier Economics intensity based scheme. The allocation of a number of free units each year and the use of a formula to reduce the number of permits issued under a benchmark for each year until 2030 will encourage the electricity sector to reduce their emissions without substantially increasing energy prices to consumers. That is the key. If you want to do this, do it in a way that will smooth out the transition and reduce the price shocks. You will still get there in the end, but you will actually get to a deeper target. That is what this amendment is about. It is about a smarter policy—a policy that the coalition was at least interested in back in 2009. That is the substance of this amendment. </span>

Can I equally acknowledge that it is certainly better policy than what we have from those opposite. Those opposite's policy is a veritable 'money-go-round'. It is simply a tax-and-spend churn. As I have highlighted before, it is remarkable that they can bring in around $9 billion a year, churn it around through the bureaucracy, spit it back out in a variety of ways and means and then end up with a deficit at the end of it. There is really nothing more inefficient than that type of activity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Your policy, Senator Xenophon, does at least seek to minimise that churn. It does seek to provide a policy framework that does not unduly apply unnecessary costs. The coalition believes that the target that Australia is looking at at present can be achieved through measures where you do not have to apply the type of cost, tax, price et cetera on to generators as discussed. But I do acknowledge that your contribution is a valuable one to this debate and the policy that you continue to advocate is something that certainly should continue to be discussed if for no other reason than to ensure that there is a demonstration that there is a far more efficient way of discussing pricing options, if that is where you want to go, than the government's pricing options on the table.</span>

It is clear also that there are many people in this chamber who are interested in this debate and the detail of it. I also understand that the government and the Greens want to limit the debate on it, hence the gag order that is in place for tomorrow.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the important things that I think the Senate needs to take note of today is the fact that there has been filibustering by the government. Unfortunately, the filibust­ering has been by many senators who were elected at the last election under that clear promise by Ms Gillard that there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. Clearly that was a misstatement. It was a false statement. It was an outrageous deceit played out upon the Australian people and they on that side of the chamber are complicit in doing so.</span>

This one-hour extension of time tonight would simply make up for the time that has been taken up by the government members who have been talking in this committee stage and in this debate even though they went to the last election promising not to introduce a carbon tax and promising not to support it. In order for me to achieve this aim, I need to move that the committee report progress and seek leave to meet at a later hour. I move:</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:55</span>):  During a recent trip to Roxby Downs to open a new school hall under the BER program in the electorate of Grey, I had some free time and visited the Arid Recovery reserve. This is a wonderful initiative that started in 1997 to restore the Arid Lands back to conditions witnessed before the introduction of non-native animals. The reserve is 123 kilometres square, and the natural beauty of the Arid Recovery reserve is quite extraordinary, with many contrasting views that show what was once there before European settlement. It is a truly amazing place with an annual rainfall of only 80mm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Arid Recovery reserve is situated near the Olympic Dam mine site, and it is very important to mention that without BHP this conservation project would not exist. This is conservation and mining working together to achieve positive outcomes. An Arid Recovery publication states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Arid Recovery restoration initiative is a unique demonstration of how mining, tourism, pastoralism, community and conservation can provide mutually beneficial conservation outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The development of a world class conservation program adjacent to the huge Olympic Dam mine and processing plant shows that contemporary mining operations can benefit, rather than threaten, regional environmental values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that you can have conservation and mining working together harmoniously. While they are often seen as adversarial interests competing for community support, I think this is a real lesson to those that take one side that it does not need to be that way and that these interests can work together. I hope that in other mining communities there is proactive support from the major industries for conservation that otherwise, without them, might not occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of Arid Recovery is simple, and that is to restore the arid zone to the very ecosystem that the first European settlers saw. The work will hopefully continue to restore populations of locally extinct mammals outside the reserve. It may sound very simple to build a fence, remove feral animals within that fenced area, breed native species and reintroduce others. However, it is through endless hard work and extreme dedication that this is achieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has struck me about Arid Recovery is that without the expertise of the staff and the help of the volunteers, the outcome might have been very different. For example, through their ingenuity they were able to build, test and implement a unique flop-top fence, which has now been used in other reserves and has even been adopted in Hawaii. This unique fence is a very effective barrier that stops feral cats, foxes and rabbits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, through the work of Arid Recovery, we are seeing native animals and vegetation protected from foreign predators with great success. Arid Recovery has also been able to reintroduce locally extinct mammals into the reserve. These mammals are the western barred bandicoot, the iconic greater bilby, the burrowing bettong and the greater stick-nest rat—not exactly household names, but this is an exciting achievement. Arid Recovery is an essential program because it restores some of the balance to the ecosystem. At least 27 native species once occupied the area around Roxby Downs. However, it is hard to comprehend that with European settlement 60 per cent of these native mammals have become locally or completely extinct. It is rather unfortunate that we have lost animals such as the pig-footed bandicoot, the Gould's mouse, the lesser stick-nest rat, the short-tailed hopping mouse and the long-tailed hopping mouse, which are all globally extinct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the native animals and the reintroduced native animals live in a controlled area away from their non-native predators. This does not mean the native animals live in a harmonious utopia for flora and fauna; it simply restores the natural playing field and subsequent natural selection. That is why Arid Recovery has reintroduced native predators such as the woma python into the reserve so that there is balance. There is also a clear difference in the vegetation within the reserve compared to the vegetation outside. There are satellite images of the significant increase in plant cover inside the reserve over a 13-year period due to pastoral animals and rabbits being excluded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reserve allows the bilbies, bettongs, western barred bandicoots, greater stick-nest rats, spinifex hopping mice, native reptiles, echidnas, native birds and even frogs to live in their native habitat. Arid Recovery are also heavily involved in research, which allows them to further understand the ecosystem inside and outside the reserve. The constant monitoring and tracking of the animals and native vegetation provide the ability to measure and test implemented strategies. This work is extremely important for the internal and wider external research, because there are not many controlled areas like the arid recovery zone. Using applied research to investigate the restoration pro­cess, they remain committed to completing their objectives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to talk about the staff of Arid Recovery. Often these hardworking Australians, who are extremely passionate about their work, do not get the recognition they deserve—not that they are asking for personal recognition. But I do believe they should be praised, especially considering it is a very small team for such a huge task. I was fortunate enough to be shown around by Hannah Spronk and Helen Crisp from Arid Recovery. These women were greatly informative and welcoming to their work area. I found them to be extremely intelligent and, above all, passionate about their work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon arrival back in Adelaide I found some time to visit their website and was not at all surprised to see the multiple awards the organisation has received. I know that awards sometimes never really judge the blood, sweat and tears that people go through. However, in this case the sheer amount of awards year by year really tells you that the workers and volunteers of Arid Recovery put everything they have into this worthwhile reserve. With success there are always opportunities to continue the trajectory they are on and, speaking to the team, I found there is room to grow, especially in staff. There is also a desire to export their expertise through consultancy. This is a very good idea and I hope they achieve this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as the workers, I would like to take the opportunity to mention the work of the volunteers. They are the ones who promptly come to the rescue when a problem arises. They are the ones who do whatever they can to assist the operations of the reserve—no questions asked. They provide an extra pair of hands to be utilised without additional cost. They are often the most powerful of marketers for Arid Recovery and some of their strongest lobbyists. Some volunteers travel hundreds of kilometres to simply give their time to the cause because they believe in the work of the reserve and can see the positive outcomes for this native habitat. I hope to return in the future and have an overnight stay and experience the park coming to life, as it does in the evenings. I believe everyone who has an interest in conservation should go and have a look at this reserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support is necessary. The cost of simply maintaining the fence is over $10,000 a year in materials, and I was told that it took thousands of hours of staff and volunteers' time. However, this is very worth while when considering the materials for the optimum fence design cost around $12,432 per kilometre. The Arid Recovery reserve is a great example of co-existence of mining and conservation. The team at Arid Recovery are excited about the expansion of Olympic Dam and hope the new airport and increase in population will bring more visitors and hopefully more sponsors to this extremely worthwhile endeavour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to put on the record that these young Australians working at the coalface of this conservation endeav­our are performing unique work in replicating the environment which has been under siege for many years throughout Central Australia. On behalf of many thousands of South Australians interested in conservation, I say thank you to them and give recognition to their efforts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:05</span>):  I have pointed out before that there were only three submissions to the recent Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into mental health that dealt with the issue of people with intellectual disability and mental health issues. I would like to emphasise that this is not because of lack of interest from the mental health and intellectual disability sector but because it is such a very small sector in Australia and how it desperately needs to grow, given the size of the problems experienced by people with intellectual disability with mental health issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The three submitters made the point that the 2011 Commonwealth budget for mental health lacked emphasis on the high burden of mental ill health experienced by people with intellectual disability, and they also pointed out that the same budget lacked specific strategies to target the difficulties experien­ced by people with an intellectual disability in accessing mental health support. I would like to focus on some of the changes that have been proposed by this government to the mental health services available and point out the problems that arise, firstly in terms of the rationalisation of GP mental health services and the impact of a two-tiered rebate structure for clinical assessment and preparation of a care plan by GPs. It is already well documented that people with an intellectual disability require much longer sessions with their GP in all aspects of health, partly because of communication problems, partly because they often have atypical symptoms related to their illness and partly because of the lack of knowledge by GPs of the problems experienced, in many cases, by people with intellectual disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The submitters to our inquiry made the point that they were very concerned about the introduction of a two-tiered Medicare rebate system for psychologists because they think it will have a very significant impact on the accessibility of services for people with intellectual disability who currently receive their mental health care treatment, such as it is, by referrals to clinical and non-clinical psychologists via GPs. There are very few psychologists currently practicing in the specific area of intellectual disability mental health and if we change the rebate structures there is a very strong concern that that tiered system of access will further reduce the incentives for specialist psycho­logists to work in this very specialised area. In fact, it will get to the situation where it will probably be impossible for specialist psychologists to make a living treating that group of clientele because they will not be able to be compensated for the amount of time that each appointment, if it is dealt with properly, will take.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The submitters to this inquiry have asked that the government look at those changes to the Better Access initiative to make very sure we know what the impact of the changes on people with intellectual disability and mental health needs will be. It is a serious concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The concerns continue. One of the other terms of reference for this inquiry was mental health workforce issues. The point has been made by submitters that Australia already has a really significant skill shortage in intellectual disability health. Research shows that GPs, psychiatrists and trainees lack confidence and training in relation to people with intellectual disability and mental disorders. There has been research over many years showing that people with intellectual disability and mental disorders receive a very poor standard of care and that the community mental health support for those people is inadequate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice that one of the submissions here has about seven references to the point of the poor standard of care and the inadequate community mental health reports. The oldest of the studies that they quote from is 1995 and the most recent is 2008. There are only isolated pockets of expertise in intellectual disability in mental health. Yet, as has been pointed out by numerous organisations in the sector, there are over 400,000 people in Australia with intellectual disability, and the point prevalence of mental health problems amongst that population has been shown by research to be about 40 per cent. This is not an area where we need tiny little handfuls of expertise, yet within the public mental health service across Australia there are no full-time staff specialist positions—not one!—devoted to this need, and only a handful of nursing positions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one recently established academic Chair of Intellectual Disability Mental Health at the University of New South Wales, which is trying to offer some advanced traineeships. But if you cannot see how you can make a living in the field and if you cannot see that there is any likelihood of coming up with a specialist position that is offered by a state or federal government body, why would you undertake such a traineeship?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, in the UK there is a very well-developed specialty in intellectual disability mental health and this has led to a large development and much improved situation for people with intellectual disability and mental disorders. We have to build capacity and improve training. At this very time the need is being pointed out to the federal government. We have the clear message that it is expensive, both in terms of the human cost of not treating mental disorders amongst people with intellectual disability and in terms of the sheer funding needed because of the need for readmissions and constant treatment that is brought about by treatments being wrong and not being carefully undertaken by people who know what they are doing in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of the submissions set out not only the human cost for individuals of wrong diagnoses or lack of expertise but also the financial cost to the system of people who are misdiagnosed and medicated wrongly, and how often these people can go through mental hospitals before we finally get a solution. Yet, at the very same time, we have heard of an example from Queensland which quite disgusts me. Since 2008 the Queensland Centre for Intellectual and Developmental Disability, which is based at the Mater Hospital, has received $120,000 per year. We are not used to figures under the millions or billions in this place but this is a miserable sum of $120,000 from Queensland Health every year to deliver vocational training in the field of intellectual disability and health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland Centre for Intellectual and Developmental Disability have used that $120,000 to increase their undergraduate teaching program, to develop a new entry to teaching program in the UQ Bachelor of Oral Health, to develop a new entry to teaching program in the UQ Bachelor of Human Movements and to actively include people with intellectual disability as co-presenters to undergraduates in the field of intellectual disability. They have helped to develop the Royal Australian College of GPs's curriculum on disability, a hugely undermet need. They have redeveloped the Managing Menstruation Kit for free download for people with intellectual disability. Given, as I was saying earlier, that poor menstrual management is one of the reasons that people try to force sterilisation on women with intellectual disabilities, I think it is particularly bad that the funding is being ceased. They have also been involved with the Brisbane South Division of General Practice in e-health initiatives for people with intellectual disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The Queensland government want to stop this funding. They have said they will cease this funding. We must do better in the field of intellectual disability. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:15</span>):  On the eve of the historic passing of the climate bills, it is timely to discuss rainforest degradation, internation­ally recognised as a major contributor to climate change. Any plan to tackle climate change must include the urgent prevention of deforestation. This is clearly an issue of climate justice. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its 2007 fourth assessment report estimated that deforesta­tion and degradation contribute globally to approximately 17 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions. This is more than the global transportation sector, third only to the global energy sector, at 26 per cent, and the industrial sector, at 19 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tropical forests such as those found in Brazil and Indonesia are the largest terrest­rial storehouses of carbon in the world. But, when they are logged or burned, the carbon they contain is released and they become massive emitters of carbon into the atmos­phere. The UN states that tropical deforest­ation now accounts for nearly 20 per cent of all global warming pollution—more than the combined emissions of every car, truck, ship, plane and train on the planet. At the same time, it reduces the planet's ability to absorb carbon dioxide. More than three-quarters of the world's accessible fresh water comes from forested catchments. As forest cover decreases, so does water quality. Deforest­ation causes an increase in natural hazards such us floods, landslides and soil erosion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how do we ensure that we protect our forests and maintain low greenhouse gas emissions? AusAID, other bilateral aid programs and a number of multilateral agencies are promoting REDD as a way to protect forests and address climate change. REDD stands for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. Increasingly, it is being seen as a highly controversial forestry initiative. The UN threw its weight behind REDD in 2008. The UN's REDD Program has 36 partner countries, spanning Africa, the Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and at least 13 countries are already involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, REDD schemes create market based offsets by putting a value on the carbon stored in forests. They claim to offer developing countries an incentive to protect and better manage their forest resources and, by doing so, also contribute to the global fight against climate change. When developed countries pay developing countries REDD offsets for their intact forests, they shift responsibility for addressing climate change from rich, developed countries onto poor, developing nations. They do not address the causes of global warming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been strong criticisms of the many flaws and negative consequences of REDD schemes. The Greens share these concerns. One criticism is that it is an offset scheme that invites developed countries to offset their responsibilities to make the larger cuts they should be obliged to achieve through domestic greenhouse gas reductions. The Australian government has done just that, giving $200 million in overseas aid to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to offset its domestic responsibility to reduce green­house emissions under a REDD program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report published in 2009 by AID/WATCH and Friends of the Earth Australia titled <span style="font-style:italic;">What a scam: Australia's REDD offsets for Copenhagen</span>, revealed why the Australian REDD offset program breaches Australia's international obligations to the UN requirement that climate aid only be granted in addition to development assistance. It makes a convincing case that Australia's REDD offsets are aimed not at reducing deforestation but at creating a source of cheap credits for increased emissions in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also exposes how Australia's 'first large scale' REDD pilot scheme's documentation failed to acknowledge the rights of local forest dependent communities, or the opposition from local people who do not want REDD offset schemes in their area. Unlike other REDD agreements, the Austra­lian agreement with Indonesia failed to guarantee indigenous rights—another breach of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, signed by Australia in April 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another criticism of REDD is the methodology used to assess the value of the carbon abatement in the REDD scheme. This year Greenpeace UK released a report which scrutinised the work of a consultancy firm, McKinsey and Company, and their advice to rainforest countries including Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The report argued that the 'McKinsey cost curve'—a tool used to measure the cost-effectiveness of carbon abatement strategies, including REDD—was an 'optical illusion' that overstated the destructive impact on small landholders and farmers. This leads to large-scale land acquisition by plantation companies. The report also downplayed the environmental impact of industrial logging and deforest­ation for plantations. REDD programs can also drive governments to plan for deforesta­tion so that they can claim a carbon credit when they stop those plans. In Indonesia, plantations for pulp and paper have destroyed much of Indonesia's rainforest. Indonesia is now planning to allow more extensive logging operations on its largely forested islands, such as Kalimantan, the home of the endangered Bornean orangutan. Getting a good price for carbon credits will not save these forests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, the then Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, and the President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, established the Indonesia-Australia Forest Carbon Partnership to support practical cooperation on REDD. To date, Australia has committed $40 million to assist Indonesia build and create the conditions to develop REDD projects. This incorporates $30 million for the Kalimantan partnership and a $10 million bilateral package to support the development of Indonesian climate related forest policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AusAID Kalimantan project is quite controversial in Indonesia. Water Land Foundation, an NGO in central Kalimantan known locally as Yayasan Petak Danum, has taken up the problems with this project. It has raised its concerns with how AusAID has handled the criticism. Following an excha­nge of letters between AusAID and the foundation, the locals felt that the Australian aid organisation was trying to placate the critics of the project rather than seriously address them. Few of the points raised by the foundation in its letter are acknowledged by AusAID to be genuine points of concern about this project. The foundation had written:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we appeal to your delegation to urge the Australian Government to withhold funding from the KFCP project until the issues raised in this letter are resolved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, AusAID, rather than work with a local NGO of high standing, ignored its appeals. Maybe they disagreed with them. Maybe they considered the issues raised by the foundation to be either resolved or in the process of being resolved. But the key issues of working with forest-dependent communities have not been addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN estimates that worldwide as many as 300 million people, most of them very poor, depend substantially on forest ecosyst­ems for their subsistence and survival. The 60 million indigenous people who live in forest areas are especially dependent on forest resources and the health of forest ecosystems. REDD threatens their sovereign rights by imposing global commercial pressures on their local communities, denying them the right to self-determination. The problem was summed up on the REDD-Monitor website. Many of the countries hoping to implement REDD are riddled with corruption, illegal logging and a failure to respect land rights and indigenous people's rights. The forestry ministries in these countries are often among the most corrupt institutions in the government. Pouring money into these countries in the hope that it will help reduce deforestation is like pouring water into a leaky bucket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These problems raise the question of where REDD fits in the carbon credit aspect of Australia's new clean energy fund. There are too many problems with REDD for it to be accepted as a legitimate carbon reduction strategy under Australia's carbon price package. We need to take responsibility for our own carbon emissions and work in a constructive way with low-income countries rather than impose an unfair scheme on disadvantaged people in these countries. We need to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas burden before we start imposing such difficulties on these people.</span>

A number of issues were talked about across the country, particularly understanding the need for awareness of borderline personality disorder.

Merinda is an artist. She confronts us with extraordinary cartoons and stories about the issues of living with mental ill health in our community. When she spoke to us in our committee, she led her evidence with the most confronting statement.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This statement brought truth to the people who were on the committee about the issues of self-harm and pain caused to people who struggle with borderline personality disorder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know—and it is very important to know—that there is increasing understanding of the condition, but the history within the mental health system in Australia has been plagued by the most terrible examples of misdiagnosis, stigma, pain and victimisation of people who are struggling with this illness. Now we are fortunate that there is more understanding, and certainly the federal government has had a role to play with this. After considerable work by the Senate committees—who are raising the issues around this, drawn and directed by the people who gave us their stories—there has been action taken. On 29 April 2010, the Minister for Health and Ageing gave approval for the development of an Austra­lian clinical guideline on BPD and also the development of a task force—an expert group to progress and oversee the initiative. The expert reference group has called together representation from mental health clinicians, GPs, psychologists, psychiatrists, researchers, carers and, most importantly consumers. These people understand the issues and they know why we must change in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The borderline personality disorder conference in Melbourne, which attracted over 300 people from the community to talk about these issues and to look at how we can progress change, had a number of recom­mendations that came out of the meeting. Critical amongst them was the need for training and skill development, and also increased community awareness and campa­igning. I want to pay real tribute to my friend Janne McMahon from South Australia, another woman I met through the Senate process, who has worked tirelessly in the area and has been such a champion to ensure that there is more awareness and acceptance within our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that I need to talk about the HYPE program at ORYGEN services in Melbourne. I have been privileged to visit there and to have a feeling of real hope about the future. We know we need to diagnose issues early, and we know that the issues around borderline personality disorder often are expressed earliest in adolescence—the issues around unstable emotions; problems with identity, self-image and thinking; difficulty with forming strong relationships; turbulent expressions of relationships with other people; and the impulsive nature of behaviour. These are all things that can lead to great judgment and victimisation from others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been change. There must be more. We need to understand and listen to the people who give us their own experiences and to ensure that people who identify with borderline personality disorder are treated with respect and compassion rather than judgment and abuse.</span>
