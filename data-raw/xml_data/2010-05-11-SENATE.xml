</talker>
<para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R4305">Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010</inline>. The bill establishes a free superannuation clearing house for small services businesses with fewer than 20 employees. In addition, it makes changes to the tax treatment of managed investment schemes, managed investment trusts, the entrepreneurs’ tax offset and consolidations. Schedule 6 makes a number of housekeeping amendments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The coalition supports the amendments contained in the schedules 2 to 6 of this bill. Many of these amendments will enhance investor certainty about the tax status of investments and, hence, should encourage additional investment. In particular, the changes to protect investors and managed investment schemes are a worthwhile response to the high-profile collapse of a number of these schemes. Under current arrangements investors can claim immediate deductions as long as a capital gains tax event does not occur within four years after the end of the income year in which the amount is first paid. These changes will protect the returns of investors from unanticipated, uncontrollable changes which cause schemes to collapse before the four-year rule is satisfied. Recently, the insolvency of several managed investment schemes has had a devastating and unexpected effect on investor funds. The Australian Taxation Office has not had the scope to provide relief to investors in these circumstances. This bill will change that and allow investors to keep their deductions where a capital gains tax event occurs because of factors outside the control of investors. Importantly, these amendments will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2007 providing some welcome relief to those affected by the recent collapses of some managed investment schemes. This bill also amends the tax law to allow managed investment trusts to make an irrevocable election to apply capital gains tax on the disposal of certain assets, such as shares and real property. Again, these provisions will provide greater certainty.</para>
<para>Schedule 4 introduces an income test for the entrepreneurs’ tax offset. The entrepreneurs’ tax offset was introduced by the former coalition government and took effect from 1 July 2005. Its aim was to provide greater incentives for very small businesses in the early stages of their development. This bill limits access to this concession by applying thresholds to taxable income over $70,000 for single individuals and $120,000 for families. Currently, eligibility for the entrepreneurs’ tax offset is not restricted by sources of income other than those derived from the small business. The coalition is concerned that these amendments will deter some from starting a business. This bill also makes some changes to the consolidation regime from a tax perspective. This regime has been continuously improved and the changes presented here stem from proposals of the former coalition government in 2007. Finally, schedule 6 contains a number of housekeeping amendments. It makes a number of minor changes to the existing tax law to ensure they operate as intended.</para>
<para>I turn now to schedule 1 of this bill, which introduces a superannuation clearing house. The coalition supports a superannuation clearing house for small businesses. The clearing house will provide small businesses with free access to services which allow them to pay their superannuation guarantee contributions in a block to an approved clearing house. Small businesses are then relieved of the need to split contributions into individual payments according to each employee’s respective superannuation fund. A clearing house provides scope to achieve economies of scale and reduces the overall costs of Australians saving for their retirement. This will reduce red tape for small business while maintaining choice for individuals to choose their own superannuation fund. Lower costs will improve the ability of small businesses to compete and will increase productivity and, ultimately, the wages of Australian workers.</para>
<para>The government likes to talk about slashing red tape and increasing productivity but has been slow to act in these instances. The government originally promised to establish the clearing house by 1 July 2009. Senator Sherry released a discussion paper in November 2008, but then over 12 months went by with no further news from the government. The deadline passed without a murmur. The superannuation industry was left doubting whether the reforms were progressing. There are private operators which already provide clearing house type services to businesses. How could they invest with any certainty while the government sat on changes that would affect the industry substantially? We should not be surprised by the government ignoring these effects. This government does not understand business. Few of its members have ever run one. As in so many other areas, the government put a high priority on discussion and consultation but less on actually delivering results. It appears that an election year has finally woken the government from its slumber.</para>
<para>Notwithstanding the coalition’s broad support for these changes, the specific proposals that are in front of us here are different from those that the government initially proposed. We do not think that many of these changes have been adequately explained. Originally the government proposed to tender the operation of the clearing house to the private sector. The Prime Minister made this promise in his original 2007 proposal. At the time, Senator Sherry claimed that the government’s proposal would not create a new bureaucracy, because the government would leverage off existing private sector providers. The discussion paper in late 2008 continued to support a tendering process, yet in November last year something changed. Suddenly the government announced that Medicare would operate the clearing house; no consideration was given to the private sector operators. On top of the uncertainty the government generated by inexplicably delaying the establishment of the clearing house, it then took away the option for private sector operators to provide these services as promised. What changed in the 12 months after the government released its discussion paper? No-one knows, and the government has provided no explanation. As one company payment adviser said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We did not hear from Treasury or anyone associated with the Government after putting in our submission. We worked to develop this solution and a few other people looked at what they could do to provide a solution to small business. And it was quite a shock late last year for a press release to say that the Government was going to give it to Medicare.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The coalition has two major concerns with this surprise decision. First, it would appear that the government is again rushing the implementation of a new program without doing sensible due diligence beforehand. Second, the special advantages that this bill provides to Medicare could have harmful effects on competition in this sector and ultimately push up the costs for businesses with more than 20 employees. The Senate inquiry on this bill has revealed that Medicare is worryingly unprepared to deliver these services to small business. It might be easier if I simply listed all the things that Medicare has not done.</para>
<para>Medicare has no estimates on the cost of providing free clearing house services. How much will costs be affected by the ultimate take-up by small businesses? We do not know. The government has allocated $16.1 million over four years, but we have no certainty of whether this is enough. Second, Medicare has not finalised its data-processing system or the types of payments that are to be accepted. Third, Medicare has not developed key performance indicators for the scheme. It cannot say how it will deal with any of the errors that arise. Fourth, Medicare has no targets for business take-up or time lines for getting the system up and running by the due date, nor has it committed to any time lines for remitting contributions to personal accounts. Medicare told the Senate inquiry that it could not commit to a time, because it did not know if there would be ‘issues with matching and some requirements for us to do follow-up work’. Funds that are not quickly transferred to the relevant accounts can have adverse effects on investor returns. We would have seen that lately. Medicare has not revealed how it will deal with the massive quarterly peaks in workloads when payments arrive. Sixth, we have not been assured that Medicare will establish a sufficient database to protect the life insurance and other entitlements of members.</para>
<para>It is almost unbelievable that the government had not worked through these issues before committing to use Medicare as its approved clearing house. If it had made a request for proposals from the private sector for these services, the government could have asked for all this information in bid documents. We would then be in a position to undertake proper due diligence, review the capacity of different providers and use pressure on different competitors to sharpen their pencils and provide the best deal for taxpayers. Instead the government has chosen a provider without any of this information being available. We are in the dark, and Medicare itself appears to be in the dark on its ability to deliver.</para>
<para>The government and Treasury have claimed that Medicare has been chosen for risk management reasons, but when the chosen provider cannot inform us of the kinds of details that normally would be contained in a bid document, how rigorous can that risk management process be? As Craig Osborne, Managing Director of MicrOpay, commented:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Medicare is not looking at the full detail that needs to be achieved when there are adequate private enterprise solutions out there ... To run with a government agency that doesn’t have a track record in collecting this information and collecting these sorts of funds, and doing the disbursements and matching and cross-checking that’s needed to ensure the system is efficient, has not been addressed or even contemplated.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Senate inquiry had a number of existing private providers which could provide clearing house services. These providers already have road-tested systems to process transactions. They know how much each transaction costs and they could implement the government’s policies quickly. Indeed, many of these providers would likely perform clearing house functions for much less than the estimated $16 million cost to Medicare. One private clearing house operator has already begun free services to small businesses without any government inducements. But overpaying for things has become a very bad habit for the Labor Party.</para>
<para>We have further reasons to be sceptical of the government’s decision to ignore these private providers and their reasons for it. A failure to manage risk is becoming a pattern. We have seen them ignore the risks highlighted to them on the pink batts program, with tragic consequences. We have seen them ignore the risks of rorting the solar hot water rebates. We have seen them ignore the risks of cost blow-outs in school halls. Once again here, we see a government that is being reactive, waiting for the risks to materialise before acting. We need a government that proactively identifies and mitigates risks in accordance with the best due diligence practices.</para>
<para>This whole delayed and incomplete process is reflective of the inherent paradoxes at the heart of the Labor government. They are slow to act but then hasty to decide. They spend years asking questions but then ignore the experts. They are busy creating announcements but do not follow them through to implementation. In summary, they are incompetent. They are managers of public policy—not necessarily a do-nothing government but an achieve-nothing government. The coalition believes that the government should return to their original plan. We believe that a competitive tendering process would provide the strongest guarantee for the transition to a clearing house which provides free and seamless service to small business while providing no interruption to the services and returns that members expect from superannuation funds.</para>
<para>But in addition to the process of establishing a clearing house there is also the actual impact that these arrangements will have on the existing providers in the sector. In particular, this bill delivers the approved clearing house a number of special advantages over its competitors. First, this bill provides that employers will be able to discharge their superannuation guarantee obligations by making a bulk payment to the approved clearing house on the 28th day of the month in each quarter when the payment is required. But current private clearing houses must themselves process the payments by the 28th day of the month in which the payments are due, which means that employers must make payments in advance of that date. Under these conditions, why would any employer not choose Medicare as its clearing house? Obviously there is a cash advantage in the cash management capacity of sending to a clearing house that has a later date of real acceptance.</para>
<para>Second, at the moment the Australian Securities and Investments Commission requires clearing houses, as financial service providers, to issue product disclosure statements which must detail the conditions of the facility, the fees and charges, how transactions are to be made and authorised, and any risks associated with the facility. So Medicare will have a lower compliance burden than private operators, and small businesses could end up with less information on the terms and conditions of their facility.</para>
<para>One of the last acts of the Keating government was to introduce principles of competitive neutrality in the delivery of government services. In simple terms, this requires governments to ensure that their own enterprises compete on a level playing field with private competitors. This bill contains elements that contradict the principles of competitive neutrality. Medicare will have a clear advantage over private sector clearing houses. The coalition view is that there is a simple way of correcting this issue. There is a real opportunity to create a more efficient superannuation clearing house market by extending the definition of ‘approved clearing house’ to privately operating clearing houses holding an AFS licence and subject to prudential requirements—a change of the term to include privately operating clearing houses. This will create a more level playing field and allow employers to make their superannuation guarantee payments to a number of clearing houses with the same deadlines. The government should also select a government subsidised clearing house following a competitive tendering process. The coalition’s changes would increase competition and could be expected to lower fees in the sector.</para>
<para>As I stated earlier, the coalition supports the broad changes in this bill. We support the changes to give investors greater certainty about the operation of the tax system. We support the principle of establishing a superannuation clearing house to lower compliance costs for small businesses. However, we do not support achieving this by giving a government entity an unfair advantage over private suppliers and private businesses and the aspirations of other Australians to participate in this market if they so choose. The coalition’s proposed amendments will maintain a level playing field among clearing house suppliers. Competition is the best way to ensure that these services are delivered at a lower cost—and the government on budget day should be more focused on lowering costs than at any other time during the year—and, more importantly, that these services are delivered in a way that guarantees no interruption to the timeliness of superannuation payments and accordingly protects members’ benefits.</para>

</talker>
<para>—On the <inline ref="R4305">Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010</inline>, which I think is generally supported except for some issues about the Medicare clearing house, I will deal with just the issues that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee was asked to look at, and they were whether the legislation will have unintended consequences for the superannuation market, whether it is anticompetitive in relation to privately operated clearing houses and whether Medicare is an appropriate agency to operate the clearing house.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Superannuation is very important to Labor governments and to our constituency. It is the basis of the savings pool of Australia and is particularly important for the retirement incomes of ordinary Australians, because they do not have the ability to increase their money through private savings that other people do. Therefore, superannuation and the administrative requirements around it are clearly of great priority for Labor governments. That is why this bill in relation to superannuation has been particularly well considered and is a good solution to the problem. The problem, as was outlined, is that many small businesses, with the choice of funds which was introduced in July 2005, have some administrative difficulties in sending off the superannuation guarantee payments to a variety of funds under a variety of different data arrangements. So the government promise before the election was to create a clearing house for small businesses such that they could simply send the superannuation guarantee fund to that clearing house. As soon as the clearing house received it, those small businesses would be in compliance with their obligations under the superannuation guarantee system.</para>
<para>So initially, as the opposition outlined, the government did indeed envisage that the clearing house would be put out to tender. But, despite Senator Joyce’s diatribe on risk and the evaluation of risk, he did not once in his speech mention the key piece of advice which persuaded the government to change that original proposal to have private companies do it. That key advice was that if a clearing house is put out to tender there is a risk that a private company, in the event of incompetence, fraud or outright failure, could potentially affect employee entitlements of all employers using the clearing house. In other words, if there were some problem within the private clearing house, employees who expected that their superannuation was going to their fund might suddenly find out that, as a result of fraud or some other failure in the private clearing house, their superannuation had not been going for years into the fund but had disappeared into a clearing house.</para>
<para>This is the situation we have occasionally seen in the United States with private funds. It would mean that employees, ordinary Australians, would suddenly find that they did not have the superannuation that they thought they had. This is clearly a huge risk for ordinary Australians and it would mean that the Australian government would therefore have a contingent liability—and I have certainly heard Senator Joyce wax long and lyrical about the dangers of contingent liabilities. So, rather than ignore it, the government dealt with the risk proposed by that, and the way they did it was to provide a government agency to deal with this. Rather than set up a bureaucracy to oversee, regulate and deal with the possibility of a failure of a private company—and then not even have that guaranteed to work—they decided that it would be more prudent and less risky on many levels to set up a government agency.</para>
<para>Fortunately, there is a government agency used to dealing with money coming in from small groups in small amounts, and dealing with it quickly and efficiently, and that agency is Medicare. Medicare are already doing this kind of work. In their evidence to our committee, Medicare were very confident of their ability to perform this additional responsibility well and efficiently, and they were very clear about this. Senator Joyce talked about KPIs and various other things and said that Medicare admitted that they did not have these procedures in place. But this was a gross misrepresentation of Medicare’s evidence. Medicare have set up a working group with involved parties to deliver a flexible, responsive and appropriate set of guidelines. They are confident that they will have those in place by the time this is up and running and they are confident that they can do it within the budget required.</para>
<para>Small businesses were happy with that response. Indeed, AustralianSuper very concisely illustrated that. As they said in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australian Super also did not agree that allowing existing clearance houses to participate would be a more efficient way of processing superannuation for small business:</para>
<para class="block">If the government were to offer subsidies to existing clearing house providers to focus a service on this segment of the market, they probably could have done it, but it would have to have been in conjunction with legislation introduced as we have seen Medicare looking at—mandatory electronic data, mandatory data standards, licensing, a guarantee on floats, and service standards on how long a clearing house can hold onto the money and send it to the funds. If your question is, ‘Could private clearing houses provide this service with the subsidy going to them?’ the answer is: yes, they could have, but it would not have been as effective as the model that we are looking at now, unless it were in conjunction with a whole list of additional criteria.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">AustralianSuper raised in there another point—that Medicare now has the ability to organise the data standards and the arrangements so that they are uniform across the sector, making it even easier for small business to provide the correct data in a uniform manner that will enable further efficiencies in the sector.</para>
<para>As for the private sector being cut out of this sector, they are able now—and they will continue to be able—to provide a clearing house service if they wish. But the committee took evidence that, of the two million small businesses in Australia, only around two per cent are currently being provided with clearing house services by SuperChoice, the largest private provider. The private providers have not been especially active in seeking this business and, if they have, they have clearly not been very successful, because only two per cent of those small businesses are operating with them. We have to remember that this is only for small businesses employing 20 or fewer people. Private clearing houses are still able to get business from any small to medium enterprise that has 20 or more players. It is not as if the market is being taken away from them; they are still free to complete in that market.</para>
<para>Speaking of 20 or more employees, the one area of the bill that the committee did make some recommendation on was the limit of 20 being monitored to make sure that businesses that had spikes in employment were adequately catered for. We were assured that there would be some flexibility in there, but we would like to make sure that those businesses that might employ 10 or 15 and have a seasonal spike and put on another six, seven or 10 employees, will not be disadvantaged by the system and have to leave it temporarily.</para>
<para>It is quite clear from our evidence that the government were presented with an unacceptable risk in dealing with the issue of tendering out to private services for this clearing house. They dealt with the risk in a pragmatic and responsible way. I was very pleased to see that that then got industry support from a broad range of sources. Industry was very pleased that this happened—both small businesses and the superannuation industry. It is a rational and reasonable response and I would urge the chamber to support this bill.</para>

<para>—We believe this bill, the <inline ref="R4305">Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010</inline>, providing for Medicare to be the clearing house for superannuation for small companies, will significantly disadvantage private organisations already in the field. It is interesting that during the 2007 election Kevin Rudd promised that the Labor government would establish a superannuation clearing house by 1 July 2009. Labor, of course, have failed to meet this promise. Prime Minister Rudd also promised that the clearing house would be contracted to the private sector. The discussion paper on the legislation issued in November 2008 also stated that the government would contract the clearing house to the private sector. However, in November 2009 the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, Mr Bowen, announced that Medicare would be awarded the contract. In other words, there was not to be any competition. The fact that there were private companies already providing this service was ignored. The government decided that Medicare, which had no experience at all in dealing with superannuation, would be awarded the contract to provide this clearing house service.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We find that very hard to accept and understand because the private clearing houses not only have a lot of experience in this area but are obviously going to be competitively disadvantaged by Medicare coming into this market. Treasury has not been able to explain why Medicare was awarded the contract by the government. We on the coalition side feel that the government should be getting best value for money, and yet no competitive tender was issued. We find that quite hard to understand. Witnesses to the Senate inquiry on the legislation, which I was involved in, indicated that Medicare has no experience in the superannuation field and does not know what it is getting itself into. It is inadequately prepared and it has not developed a business plan to provide this service.</para>
<para>The government has awarded $16.1 million to Medicare to operate the clearing house over a four-year period. However, many experts in the private sector have said that the costs will inevitably blow out and that Medicare will not be able to provide the service within this budget. Private sector companies have provided these services in the market for years and have designed and implemented innovative technology to deliver low-cost services to employers and superannuation funds. We find it very hard to understand, as I said, why the private sector has not been offered the opportunity to participate in the provision of this service.</para>
<para>At the inquiry, the Superannuation Information Centre submitted that the decision to send the clearing house to Medicare means that there is serious potential for large-scale economic waste. They pointed out that it is not clear if Medicare will be subject to the same professional indemnity insurance that private clearing houses are required to hold. Senator Hurley has said that there was concern that the private sector might default in some way and that employees would find that their funds for superannuation had not been passed on to the superannuation funds. But, of course, if these private sector companies have indemnity insurance then that is not a matter of concern. It seems that Medicare does not have private sector indemnity insurance and it may be that the real concern is whether or not Medicare will be the defaulter and whether employees may be at greater risk if Medicare is handling this service. If in some way there is a problem meeting deadlines and so on, employees may not be covered in the way they would be were the service provided by the private sector. These are very serious concerns that we in the coalition have with this legislation and we certainly believe that more consideration should be given to it.</para>
<para>But basically we are really concerned about why the government has not explained the reason for breaking its commitment to tender the service to the private sector, that Medicare has not publicly made a business case for establishing the clearing house and that many operators in the superannuation sector have expressed concern about the anticompetitive nature of this decision by the government.</para>
<para>We really do believe that there is a very strong case for private sector superannuation clearing houses to be given the opportunity to compete for this market. The sector’s largest clearing house, SuperChoice, told the Senate inquiry that currently it is processing around 20 million contributions on behalf of 50,000 employers, 40,000 of whom are employers with fewer than 20 employees. They account for two million-odd employees. SuperChoice said: ‘Overall we project about $7.2 billion will be cleared through our service. We estimate that it is around 20 per cent of the entire clearing market.’</para>
<para>The superannuation fund contracts the clearing house transactions to companies like SuperChoice who provide their services to the employers free of charge through their chosen super fund. We in the coalition believe that if the government goes ahead and introduces its own clearing house operator and enforces preferential regulations on that operator when compared to the currently operating clearing houses, the legislation has the potential to seriously impact upon the business of those privately operated clearing houses. In other words, giving this contract to Medicare may well so adversely affect some of these privately operating clearing houses that their businesses will be made non-viable.</para>
<para>At the inquiry which the Senate Economics Legislation Committee held, Westpac made the following comment in its submission on the different superannuation guarantee requirements:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This important difference means that private sector clearing houses, such as Westpac’s QuickSuper, will be forced to compete in a market distorted by the change and no longer uniform or equitable from public and private sector participants. This will have negative consequences for small business who choose to continue to use private sector clearing houses.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Westpac recommended that the legislation be amended to ensure clearing house standards are the same across both the private and public sectors.</para>
<para>While the intentions of Medicare may be to provide a superannuation clearing house to those employers who cannot currently access a free service, the legislation and regulations will allow absolutely any business with fewer than 20 employees access to a free service, and that is where the threat to the viability of the private superannuation clearing houses comes in. For example, the 40,000 employers who use the SuperChoice clearing house service will have an overwhelming incentive to switch to the free Medicare clearing house due to the far less stringent requirements for discharge of super guarantee payments through Medicare.</para>
<para>The government has recently said that the way superannuation can be strengthened is to drive efficiencies, reduce administrative costs and thus increase returns, and this is the exact opposite of what the superannuation sector will achieve by this bill in its current form if it is passed. As IFSA stated in their submission:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If the Item 3 amendment is passed as drafted, we would be concerned about the erosion of the “level playing field” in the provision of clearing house services.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">IFSA has long maintained that competition is the key to an efficient and cost-effective superannuation system and that this should occur on a level playing field. Quite obviously, if Medicare is allowed to be the sole provider and it is providing its services free of charge, there will no longer be a level playing field.</para>
<para>AFSA, another superannuation provider, suggested that the legislation could be improved by amending it so as to provide a path forward whereby private sector organisations could achieve approved clearing house status and that that would provide a level playing field. They said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The path forward could include the establishment of operating standards combined with regulatory oversight, as envisioned by the government’s original statement. Importantly, this would ensure clearing houses meet certain minimum requirements and provide a wider range of employers with the opportunity to meet their SG obligation by contributing through a clearing house.</para>
</quote>
<para>We in the coalition are very disappointed that the government has broken its original commitment to put this clearing house service out to tender and can only say that it is typical of the 1930s socialist approach of the Rudd government. The government has to do everything and yet out there in the community we have these very efficient private sector superannuation clearing house operations. There is absolutely no reason why these organisations should not be given the opportunity to participate in providing superannuation clearing house services to these companies which are the target of this legislation.</para>
<para>Quite worryingly, Medicare’s evidence to the inquiry demonstrated that the agency has not completed a business plan to a level which would have been required in a competitive tender process, and in the course of their evidence Medicare made the following comments to the hearing. Firstly, they said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We do not have any targets at this point in terms of the number of businesses which are going to use the system.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, they have no idea how many businesses are going to use their system. Therefore one has to ask: how are they going to gear up to provide the service?</para>
<para>They said that they did not go and cost an alternative provider. They said: ‘We are considering options to accept employer payments. We have looked at the alternatives. We have not reached any firm decision on that and we are still talking with the industry about that.’ Medicare said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We have a wide range of KPIs … I cannot imagine we would deviate from the normal Medicare ones. We have payment cycles of 14 days for some things as well as other time frames.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This may mean that they miss the deadlines for the payment of super into the super funds if they stick to their existing 14-day time frames for payments.</para>
<para>Then there is the question of upfront validation. Medicare said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We do not check with the fund at that point to ensure the member details match up when the employer sends us a payment. … At this stage we are not planning to do that sort of validation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">One has to wonder what sorts of standards private Medicare will have in acting as a clearing house for superannuation and whether the slack approach, the apparently vague approach, demonstrated by these statements of Medicare—that indicate they have not really come to grips with the requirements of providing superannuation by time deadlines—is going to mean that the employees are going to be disadvantaged by the vagueness of the Medicare operation.</para>
<para>Private clearing houses also have raised concern about Medicare being awarded this contract, on exactly these grounds. SuperChoice said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… a significant underestimation of the costs to build and operate an effective clearing house, particularly in the time frame that Medicare has been given—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">is a matter of concern. They continued that there will be:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… likely poor employer experiences as a result of rushing into operation of a functionality based service offering, which will lead to growing employer complaints and an increase in red tape for employers; relatively low benefits for super funds, which will be offset by the cost to access the clearing house; an inequitable landscape, where 85,000 employers who employ 7.7 million employees are not offered the same level of benefits that SME employers will access through Medicare; and ultimately a missed opportunity to support the industry to advance its e-commerce aspirations.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Superannuation Information Centre submitted that the decision to send the clearing house to Medicare means there is a serious potential for large-scale economic waste.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I say that, given the evidence available, Medicare and Treasury have not been able to prove that Medicare can handle the scheme at the budget provided without risk to employee superannuation payments. Many in this industry have legitimate concerns about how Medicare will operate the scheme. I think that leads to the conclusion that this is bad legislation which needs to be amended to provide choice to employers rather than forcing them to use the Medicare system.</para>

<para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R4305">Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010</inline>. As many speakers have alluded to on this side, the bill introduces a number of measures, the majority of which are supported by the coalition. However, as has become a hallmark of the Rudd Labor government, as history since Rudd Labor have been in power now dictates, everything that this government does you need to look very carefully at. You need to carefully review the details of their legislation. In reviewing the detail of this legislation, we find incorporated quietly into the provisions of this bill, in the hope no-one will see them, provisions that are of real concern to the coalition. These provisions relate to the government’s policy to implement a superannuation clearing house for small business. Surprise, surprise: the provisions that are of concern to the coalition relate to yet another broken promise by the Rudd Labor government. But nothing is new in that regard. Those on the other side continue to mismanage and waste taxpayers’ money. They are chronically incapable of delivering sound government to the Australian people. And we are going to see in question time today the shaking and the quivering when they are made to answer questions in relation to their proposed super tax.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Kevin Rudd Labor is all talk and no action. This is yet another broken promise. The government promised to protect our borders; they failed on that. They have monumentally and tragically failed on the Home Insulation Program. They have failed to deliver value for money to taxpayers with the so-called Building the Education Revolution. They have failed in relation to the creation of their GP superclinics. The list goes on and on. The question that the Australian people are entitled to be asking this government is: what exactly does Mr Rudd stand for? The only thing on this side we can see him standing for is short-term political opportunism. Everything he does ends up in a policy backflip, a backdown or a disaster. The only thing Kevin Rudd is prepared to fight for is himself, especially in light of the rumours circulating regarding the new Labor leadership team—and the bad news for Mr Rudd is that his name is not on it. Julia Gillard and Craig Emerson must be very happy at the moment. What do we have with this legislation? Yet another broken promise by the Australian Labor Party.</para>
<para>Why do we say it is a broken promise? During the 2007 election the Labor Party promised to the people of Australia that they would establish a superannuation clearing house by 1 July 2009. The question that we now need to consider is: did the Labor Party deliver on that promise? The answer is a resounding no. The Labor Party failed to deliver on an election commitment to the Australian people. However, there was of course, in typical Labor style, a flurry of action in relation to this now broken promise. What did the Labor Party do? An amount of $16 million was allocated to the clearing house in the 2008-09 federal budget to form what the government called an election promise to reduce the superannuation red-tape burden on employers. What did they then do? They issued a discussion paper for the clearing house, which was released in November 2008, seeking submissions by 19 December 2008. Then what happened? Absolutely nothing. There was a deafening silence from the Rudd Labor government. We did not hear one word from them, which may be okay for those sitting on the other side, but the industry was left guessing as to what may happen in relation to the potential changes to its regulatory environment. But, again, as is the history of the government, you expect nothing more and nothing less.</para>
<para>I said that this legislation represented two broken promises by the Rudd Labor government, the first being their blatant failure to actually deliver on a commitment that they gave to the people of Australia prior to the 2007 election. What was the second? On 26 November 2009, after they had failed to deliver on their election commitment and realised that they had to do something because the industry were saying, ‘We’re up in arms. What are we going to do? We actually don’t know what is going on,’ they released an exposure draft on the superannuation clearing house legislation. What did they quietly do through the exposure draft? They announced that the Labor government would not tender the clearing house to the private sector and had decided to fund Medicare to deliver the service rather than the private sector. What do we have by that announcement? Another broken promise by Rudd Labor because, in 2007, when Mr Rudd was the opposition leader, he issued a media release. On 10 May 2007, Mr Rudd stated very clearly that the clearing house would be contracted to none other than—no, not Medicare—the private sector. Mr Rudd, as a potential leader of this country, said to the people of Australia, ‘If I am elected, the clearing house will be tendered to the private sector.’ One has to ask: did Mr Rudd ever have any desire to actually deliver on that promise? It is a blatant election breach, so the answer to that is a clear and resounding no.</para>
<para>What do we now have? We have the legislation before us, which represents part of a broken promise to the Australian people. But, in November last year, without any warning, without any explanation, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law announced that the clearing house would be awarded to Medicare. One has to ask: where did that decision come from? How can the minister go from, in 2007, a pre-election commitment that the clearing house would be awarded to the private sector to, in 2009, saying, ‘We’ve awarded the superannuation clearing house to Medicare’?</para>
<para>What we do know, though, is that there are leaked Treasury minutes from the working group on the issue that indicate that Treasury consider that clearing house operations under Medicare will lack functionality when compared to that offered by the private sector and, in particular, that BPAY is to be the only payment method supported, not direct credit or direct debit—something that people often use—and that industry standard data formats will not be used. How is that for efficiency? But I tell you what: based on the government’s reputation, I would prefer the evidence from the leaked Treasury documents as opposed to believing any statement from those opposite. The government is clearly vulnerable in deciding to award the clearing house contract to Medicare and, in so doing, it refuses to answer the question: why did the government award the contract to Medicare? It is a very simple question.</para>
<para>Treasury, during a recent estimates sitting, refused to answer any questions. In the explanatory memorandum on this bill the decision is mentioned only once. Then we had Medicare claiming that they had completed costings on this proposal but then they refused to publicly release what those costings were. I would have thought that the public are entitled to know just how much this funding of Medicare will cost them. Medicare have also admitted that they have not finalised their system for data processing and the types of payments to be accepted. That is in stark contrast to what could have been occurring in the private sector. Contrast Medicare’s situation to that of Australia’s largest superannuation clearing house, SuperChoice. They made a detailed submission to the government. They stated in their submission that they would be able to implement the government’s policy at a fraction of the government’s anticipated cost of $16 million. I thought Mr Rudd was all about savings. That is all the spin that he gives to the Australian people, but what is the substance? It is absolutely lacking. SuperChoice’s submission refers to $1.57 million in start-up costs, $200,000 per month in operating costs and between a $15 and $60 per month cost for each employer using the scheme, depending on the take-up. That is a stark difference to the $16 million under Medicare, which has been quoted by Rudd Labor.</para>
<para>So what do we have again, in contrast? SuperChoice and other private providers have detailed computer systems already in place and could easily incorporate additional employers under the government’s plan. Instead, what do the government do? They say: ‘No, no, no. Forget about functionality, forget about operational efficiency, Medicare can do it even if they are required to create and implement a processing system from scratch.’ Talk about reinventing the wheel at taxpayers’ expense! There has been no justification provided by the Rudd Labor government as to why it awarded the contract to Medicare. If I were a member of the Australian public—and I am—I would be very, very worried. I would have thought it more appropriate for Medicare to be discharging its core responsibility of delivering services to the Australian public than designing a computer system from scratch and doing something that, quite frankly, it should not be doing. The questions the Australian public should be asking—and which those on the other side should be answering—are: how will Medicare deal with the quarterly massive peaks in workload created by the operation of the clearing house? How are they going to staff this? Are there going to be additional staff provided to Medicare—again, at additional cost to the Australian public? The public are entitled to know the answers to these questions. Medicare’s preparation to operate the clearing house is an example of a government agency getting involved in a sector where private companies have been operating efficiently for many, many years. Giving any government—let alone a Labor government—control over millions of dollars of superannuation payments is a very, very dangerous thing.</para>
<para>So what have the coalition done? The coalition have proposed an amendment to the legislation. That is right, the coalition want to assist the government in meeting its 2007 election commitment. We support the superannuation clearing house for small business. We believe it will lower compliance costs associated with the SuperChoice system. However, the coalition have a responsibility to hold the Rudd Labor government to account in relation to its political waste and management of taxpayers’ money. Our amendment to this legislation is therefore a very, very simple one. The amendment will merely force the government to have Medicare compete for the private tender. That is it. It is all about choice—nothing more and nothing less—which is something those on the other side are fundamentally opposed to. The amendment does not actually tell the government how it will achieve this choice; it simply requests that the decision to name Medicare as the operator over private sector clearing houses be made transparently and with good reason.</para>
<para>‘Transparently’—isn’t that a word that Mr Rudd used prior to the 2007 election? Has Mr Rudd come clean with the Australian people on the issue of transparency? This legislation continues to affirm that he has not. Unlike Medicare, private superannuation clearing houses have already invested millions and millions of dollars in designing efficient systems that process millions of transactions every year. Why is the government so insistent upon reinventing the wheel? Our amendment does not give the project to the private sector; it merely ensures that the private sector has a chance to compete for it. What we want the government to do is to ensure that it chooses the most effective and most efficient option for delivering clearing houses to small business. The question I ask those on the other side is: given the very, very clear election promise that Mr Rudd made to the people of Australia in 2007, are those on the other side going to stand here today and vote down the coalition’s amendment, which effectively means they will be voting against their own election commitment? This is the commitment Mr Rudd made prior to the November 2007 election.</para>
<para>As I said at the beginning of my contribution, the opposition support many elements of this bill. However, we have major reservations about the impact of the proposed government clearing house. This part of the legislation is nothing more and nothing less than a backward step by the Rudd Labor government. To depart from a very, very clear and explicit election promise to have a service that is provided on a contestable basis is a failure by the Rudd Labor government. In his speech on this legislation my esteemed colleague Luke Hartsuyker, the member for Cowper, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We have no problem with the allocation of the job of the government funded clearing house to Medicare if Medicare is able to compete with private sector operators and put in a bid that is price and service competitive and offers the same degree of amenity or better amenity than is being offered by private operators. But there is a very distinct possibility that we are going to squander large amounts of government money and see a more expensive solution and a less customer orientated outcome.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is the Australian taxpayers who will lose out in the end if this legislation goes through in its current form. It is their money that is going to be squandered by the Rudd Labor government. To ensure that taxpayers are getting value for money, to ensure that private businesses do not suffer, to ensure that life insurance is protected and to ensure that this exercise does not turn into yet another of the bungled Rudd Labor government’s exercises, I urge those on the other side to support the coalition’s amendment.</para>

<para>—I rise today to make some remarks on the<inline ref="R4305">Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010</inline>. I particularly want to comment on the forestry managed investment schemes part of the legislation, and to note that what this particular amendment is doing is protecting the right of a taxpayer to claim and retain a deduction for investment in forestry managed investment schemes where the four-year holding rule is breached for reasons outside the taxpayer’s control.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Clearly, this is being brought in because of the failure of a whole range of managed investment schemes—in particular, Great Southern, Forest Enterprises Australia Ltd, Timbercorp, Environinvest, Radiata Plantations Ltd, and on and on the list goes. We all know that, because of the recklessness of the managed investment scheme product, we have a situation where investors got an upfront tax deduction. The government moved to bring in an integrity measure saying that you had to hold that investment for four years so that people did not just move in, take on the investment, get the tax deduction and move out.</para>
<para>In my view, we should have abolished managed investment schemes altogether. That is still my view. I would be very interested to know why the government maintains their support for forestry managed investment schemes when we have a glut of wood product from one end of the country to the other and one end of the world to the other. Now is the opportunity to protect our native forests if we want to have any value at all left in this wall of wood that is now in Australia. But, having said that, the situation we now have is to protect those people who made their investment in these managed investment schemes, and they are not the ones who sold out of them—rather, the company that they invested in collapsed.</para>
<para>In talking about these managed investment schemes, though, I think we need to go a lot further than we are here. We really need to ask: what is the role of the tax commissioner and the discretion that the tax commissioner offers in relation to these particular products? I am aware that, in 2000—and this is from a paper by Dr Judith Ajani—the government responded to the Ralph review of business tax with, amongst other things, division 35 amendments aimed at removing the practice of presenting consumption expenses for non-commercial activities as business expenses. That led to a test on division 35 rules for commerciality.</para>
<para>The test was that business people had to pass one of the following: that they had an assessable income from the activity of at least $20,000, or had produced a profit in three out of the past five years, or used real property or an interest in real property worth at least $500,000 on a continuing basis, or used other assets worth at least $100,000 on a continuing basis. Leaving aside very important arguments about the commerciality test’s arbitrary and inequitable nature and scope for improvement, a review of matured hardwood plantation MIS investments would probably find that most of them failed the first test, and probably no plantation MIS investor would pass the other three tests.</para>
<para>So what has happened is that plantation MIS investors have received dispensation from division 35, with the ATO commissioner exercising discretionary powers in specified areas. The commercial loss provisions, which are specifically addressed in product rulings, require the tax office to consider the commercial viability of plantation MISs. And, in using his discretionary powers to give plantation MIS investors the right to deduct investment costs against income earned from other activity, the commissioner must have judged that plantation MIS investments are inherently commercial by some criteria. But we have no publicly available data on the tax office’s operation of division 35.</para>
<para>Since 1998 we have had a series of tax commissioners. They have all used their discretion to give a product ruling, essentially, on these managed investment schemes. It is a tick for the tax concession, and therefore it is also a tick on viability—it is sending a clear message to investors that the tax commissioner has made a judgment that these must be viable financial investments to have achieved the product ruling and to have achieved the tax concession.</para>
<para>So I think it is really about time, as Dr Ajani points out in her paper, that we had a really good look at the tax office and the commissioner’s rulings and discretionary power, and at the reasons why that assessment of viability was made, when we have had, subsequently, collapses from Great Southern, Forest Enterprises, Timbercorp, Environinvest, et cetera. How could the tax commissioner have been giving, essentially, this nod of approval about financial viability when, clearly, that has not stood the test of time?</para>
<para>Dr Ajani argues:</para>
<quote>
<para>To create the information for policy debate and policy making, evaluation and monitoring, it is recommended that:</para>
<list type="decimal-dotted">
<item label="1.">
<para>Treasury and the ATO conduct five-yearly reviews (with the first to be undertaken immediately) of the process and information used to rule on plantation MIS dispensation from Division 35 commerciality tests.</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>The ATO, ASIC, Treasury and Productivity Commission establish a publicly accessible plantation MIS reporting and monitoring system where, at a minimum, the key variables—return on investment, wood yield and woodchip prices—are tracked over time for each project.</para>

</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">and that:</para>
<quote>
<list type="decimal-dotted">
<item label="3.">
<para>The Productivity Commission’s ERA estimates be expanded immediately to include assistance through plantation MIS using, in the first instance, Approach 1—tax deduction for true costs only.</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think we really have got to the point where we need some explanation from the tax office and the tax commissioner as to the basis for their discretionary use or interpretation of that particular section of the tax act. I would be very interested in the division 35 rules in trying to understand what criteria were used for judging that plantation MIS investments are inherently commercial. We have never, ever seen that from the tax office, but it is about time we did because a lot of people have lost out through this process in rural and regional Australia. It has led to a complete distortion in land use. It has led to a clash between food security and wood product, and now we have what is a complete collapse in the wood products industry around Australia. This is probably one of the biggest examples of a public policy disaster that Australia has seen, and certainly as rural and regional Australia see it at the moment. When you look at the complete collapse of the timber industry and the whole of the forest products industry in Tasmania, you can sheet home a lot of the blame to a complete failure to look at the market realities of the wood products industry globally and the failure to recognise the glut and the distortional influence of managed investment schemes.</para>
<para>I also give notice that I will be moving an amendment to this legislation in the committee stage to abolish the tax deductibility for carbon sink forests, given what I have just said in relation to the glut of wood products around the country and because of the need to test the tax office ruling in relation to whether the upfront costs of land are incorporated in the tax deduction. I recognise that there is a statement saying that they are not, but we will wait and see what a court has to say about that, given the way that that has been packaged and the advice I have from a leading tax barrister in that field who is looking at the law. It is very clear to me that, if we are to have carbon sink forests in rural and regional Australia, they must be biodiverse and permanent, not some other dodge for yet another excuse to go in with monoculture plantations and again make some sort of profit out of that distortional influence in rural and regional Australia, particularly as it pertains to land prices and, as is coming down the line, food security.</para>
<para>Today we have a report on the loss of biodiversity across Australia. It is 30 per cent less than we had in 1970 and, at that rate, we will be losing all species by the end of the century. It is a pretty sobering kind of analysis of what is going on with our wildlife around Australia. What we desperately need in the face of climate change, peak oil and this species crisis are policies that lead to the restoration of ecosystems, the maintenance of existing ecosystems and the protection of existing carbon stores in terms of forests and native vegetation, not some distortional policy, such as the government has in place here, which is yet another example of having monoculture plantations to try to benefit from taxation minimisation schemes. This is something that the coalition also needs to look at very carefully in its climate change policies and to make sure that there is recognition that what we currently have in carbon sink forests legislation is totally flawed. It does not have biodiversity and it does not have permanence in its sights. It is just another one of these poorly thought-through schemes. So I indicate that, when we get to the committee stage, I will be looking at that and moving an amendment on it.</para>
<para>I also want to say that I think it demonstrates a complete lack of courtesy to the Senate for the government to have dropped in a whole swag of amendments three or four minutes before this debate. I did not see them until 25 past 12 today. I do not know whether the coalition had the opportunity of seeing and being briefed on the amendments that were dropped here just before this debate began; perhaps the coalition may wish to clarify whether they did have that opportunity. I did not and I am not prepared to proceed beyond the second reading stage until there has been the courtesy of a briefing to the various parties in this place as to what these amendments mean. I note that there appears to be a connection between managed investment schemes and managed investment trusts. I do not know what that means and I would appreciate some explanation. I note that page 19 of the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As the Explanatory Memorandum for the current Bill explains, a wholesale trust ‘is a MIS [Managed Investment Scheme] that has wholesale clients and is not required to be registered under the Corporations Act 2001’</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I notice that, in one of the proposed amendments we have, ‘Proposed subdivision 275(a) extends the concept of managed investment trust to certain widely held trusts that do not otherwise meet the definition of a managed investment trust.’ I want to know whether, under some circumstances, managed investment schemes are regarded as managed investment trusts and what these amendments mean in terms of their treatment. It may be, as the minister has claimed, that this is just a technical amendment that has no significant meaning in the scheme of tax law. I am not an expert on tax law by any stretch of the imagination and do not pretend to be, but I would appreciate an explanation from the government as to the connection between the changes being proposed for managed investment trusts and managed investment schemes in terms of how the two operate and connect. If the government does want the Senate’s support for amendments, particularly in areas like tax law, which is hugely complicated, it has an obligation to circulate those amendments not with a couple of minutes to go before the debate.</para>
<para>To conclude, I am glad that ASIC currently has out a consultation paper regarding managed investment schemes. In my view, it is about time that ASIC took its responsibilities in relation to these schemes a little more seriously than it has in the past. When I wrote to ASIC about the fact that I regarded these managed investment schemes as no more than Ponzi schemes, I got a note back saying that it was beyond the capacity of ASIC to make judgments like that and that they had to look at the product disclosure briefs in their offerings to make sure that they adhered to certain regulatory disclosure, but no judgment could be made as to the veracity of those. In my view, that is misleading investors.</para>
<para>I am pretty disgusted all round with the way managed investment schemes have worked. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the government would continue with this structure of managed investment schemes when it is very clear that they have been a disaster in terms of forest policy, wood products and the price of agricultural land and now they are a disaster for a whole range of investors who went into them not because they were interested in wood products but because they were interested in minimising their tax. Once you separate the reason for the investment from the outcome, as occurs with managed investment schemes, you are setting up a disaster.</para>
<para>I would like to see the government get rid of managed investment schemes altogether. I think we are going to be cleaning up the mess from those schemes for a very long time to come, especially as they pertain to land use in rural and regional Australia, wood supply and the wood products industry around Australia—not to mention integrity. I am particularly keen to know from the tax commissioner the basis on which he has deemed, since 1998, for more than a decade, these managed investment schemes to be commercially viable. The community has a right to know why the tax office gave that tick of approval.</para>

<para>—I endorse wholeheartedly Senator Milne’s comments in relation to managed investment schemes. I note that Senator Milne will be moving an amendment to the <inline ref="R4305">Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010</inline>, which I will be supporting, in relation to managed investment schemes. If I could add to one of the criticisms that Senator Milne made about these schemes, not only do they affect issues around wood products, agricultural use and land use, they also affect water. They distort the water market. They act to intercept water that otherwise would be going to river systems, which completely distorts both the use of agricultural land and the inflow of water into our river systems. So I will be supporting that amendment strongly, and hopefully the government will see the logic of clamping down on these schemes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I should also foreshadow that I will be moving, in the same vein, in a sense, as Senator Milne’s amendment, an amendment to formulate a test, to be known as a ‘public benefit test’, against the aims and activities of entities, whether they be religions or charities, to receive tax-free status. My colleagues know of my position in relation to the Church of Scientology and of my moves to have an inquiry into it. We should go down the path of having a public benefit test, and this bill is as appropriate a vehicle as any other tax amendment bill to deal with these matters.</para>
<para>In relation to this particular bill, ask any small business owner and they will tell you that one of their biggest burdens is red tape, with administrative costs on par. It is time consuming, frustrating and confusing, and anything that reduces time and money spent on administrative duties so that they can focus on the business itself is ideal. Small business owners can have anywhere from one to 20 employees, and it is more than likely that each of these employees has a different superannuation fund, so many small businesses opt to use a clearing house service, where the provider receives a total deposit for all its employee super payments from the employer and deposits the relevant moneys and funds accordingly. The establishment of a government-run optional superannuation clearing house seems a logical step which will, most importantly, enable employers to extinguish their superannuation obligations with a single payment to the approved clearing house. This means that, once the employer has made their payment to the clearing house fund, they will not be liable for a superannuation guarantee in instances where the superannuation is, for whatever reason, not paid to the employee’s fund.</para>
<para>I understand the concerns of the opposition and of some stakeholders in terms of the allocation of this project to Medicare and the effect that it has on competition in the sector, and I note Senator Cash’s impassioned speech about the promises that were made at the last election, but it seems to me that the issue is about the implementation of this. The issue is about facilitating this for employers, and the clearing house is the way to go. I note that the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia says that this measure was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The most significant first step in lowering administration costs for employers ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and therefore it is to be welcomed.</para>
<para>I will speak to the opposition’s amendments when they are moved, during the committee stage. It is important that we consider the risks involved in this going to a private fund. Given the time constraints, I think it is more appropriate to ventilate the issues in the context of amendments that will be moved by the opposition in the committee stage. I support the second-reading stage of this bill. I will listen to the arguments in relation to the opposition’s amendments; but, from what I have seen so far, this seems to be a sensible way forward in dealing with the issue. Administratively, it seems to be the cleanest and most effective way of relieving the burden on small businesses of their superannuation obligations where there are multiple funds involved.</para>

We never agreed on anything politically, but we were able to work cooperatively. I wish him well in his new role as active backbencher.</para>

<para>—by leave—On 3 May, Senator Minchin, in defiance of his total party room, resigned as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—a great way to leave. We wish him and his loved ones well. Consequent upon Senator Minchin’s decision, the Liberal senators elected me as leader and my colleague Senator the Hon. George Brandis SC as deputy leader. For the information of senators, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> an updated list of the coalition shadow ministry.</para>

<para>—by leave—Unlike Senator Brown, I am almost always on good terms with Senator Abetz, with some notable exceptions—but that may well change given his new role. I wish to congratulate Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis on their leadership positions. Also, to my fellow South Australian senator, Senator Minchin, I really do wish him all the best. I will not repeat my private conversations, but I think we are all with you given the traumatic events of the last few weeks. We are all delighted to see things are going much better for your lad.

<para>—I might start by thanking honourable colleagues for their comments. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister Carr. Can the minister explain how the Australian mining industry will remain viable when Mr Rudd’s great, big new tax on mining will make Australia the highest taxed mining industry in the world?</para>

<para>—The government’s new tax reforms are about making Australia a more attractive place for investment, and that includes a more attractive place for investment in the resources sector. We will have a company tax rate falling from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from 2013-14. We will have a resources super profits tax that only taxes projects when they become profitable, not on what they produce. We will have a resources exploration rebate that will provide an immediate cash rebate of 30 per cent for eligible exploration expenditure.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But that is only part of the resources super profits tax and what it is all about. It is also about providing essential infrastructure that will enable Australia’s resource industries to achieve their full export potential, starting with a $700 million investment in the period 2012-13. It is also about sharing the rewards of the resources boom so that all Australians get a return from the exploration of this non-renewable resource. It is about equity and it is about social justice. The reality is that it is about the Australian community— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister’s answer, can he explain why a range of mining companies have already shelved plans to continue with exploration and certain projects? Three premiers, two of them Labor, have expressed concerns and a range of finance institutions have advised clients that Australia was now seen as a high sovereign risk destination to invest, with a significant risk of major capital flight out of Australia.

It opposes measures that we introduce sight unseen because this is an opposition that is about obstructing the progress of economic development in this country. This is an opposition that is not actually interested in debating the fortunes of this country because it has already determined that it will oppose any measure that this government introduces. We have a process of discussion with the mining and resources industries and the states about implementation details.

Given that this great big new tax will raise $9 billion per year compared to the $8 billion per year interest repayment required in 2012-13 to service Labor’s great big debt, doesn’t this just prove that the government is raising taxes simply to pay for its reckless spending to the detriment of jobs in the resources sector—or is it all just a great big coincidence?</para>

<para>—I think the opposition has to face up to its responsibilities to the Australian people because, as far as this government is concerned, we have a responsibility to capture the real value of our mineral wealth and apply it to make this country fairer and stronger. We are using this revenue to generate more superannuation savings for working families, we are using it to lower taxes for all companies—especially for small business—and we are using this revenue to meet our future infrastructure needs, particularly in the mining states. The government takes a responsible approach; the opposition takes an irresponsible approach. Our focus is on building this nation for the common good and we will not be deterred by vested interests or by the servants of the status quo over there. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—As part of the package of tax reforms that were announced last week to make the tax system fairer and simpler, there will be a number of significant improvements to the Australian superannuation system. Firstly, there will be a gradual increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent starting on 1 July 2013. Secondly, there will be a new superannuation concession of up to $500 for some 3.5 million low-income earners who currently receive no tax concession on their compulsory superannuation contributions. In fact, there is a group of people who, because of the compulsory nature of superannuation, pay a 15 per cent contributions tax when some of them pay effectively no income tax, and this is manifestly unfair. Thirdly, we will be extending the $50,000 superannuation contribution cap for those over 50 with balances below half a million dollars from 1 July 2012.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The increase in the superannuation guarantee will benefit 8.4 million Australians. It will mean an 18-year-old entering the workforce will have an extra $200,000 in retirement income. For someone now aged 30 they will have an extra $108,000 and for a person aged 40 they will have some $57,000 extra at retirement. These measures will also boost the total pool of superannuation savings by some $85 billion over 10 years. The superannuation industry and the financial sector have strongly supported these improvements in the individual retirement savings of Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The 2010 <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> identified that between now and 2050 the number of people aged 65 to 84 years will more than double, the number of people aged over 85 will more than quadruple and nearly one-quarter of the population will be aged 65 and over compared to about 13 per cent today. Obviously, their personal retirement income is of critical importance in supporting them during their retirement years. This means that there will be only 2.7 people of traditional working age for every person aged 65 and over compared with five today. This is a huge shift in the ageing population. So the historic reforms that I have referred to in respect of superannuation will deliver a significant boost to the retirement incomes of the vast majority of Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—As I mentioned in my answer to the first question, these reforms to superannuation are part of a package of tax reforms. The package of tax reforms also includes a cut to the company tax rate, from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, and additional relief and simplification through a $5,000 instant asset write-off for small business. Those reforms, together with the very significant superannuation changes that I have outlined to the chamber, are part of a package. The way in which this package is funded is by the resource superannuation tax that is being introduced.</para>

<para>It is true that we are accommodating some families who are seeking asylum in this country in that motel. Some people have been there for a number of weeks. The newsworthiness of this surprises me, given that it was on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> about three weeks ago. Clearly, Senator Brandis and the Liberal Party do not read the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>. I confirm that we have been accommodating some asylum seekers, particularly vulnerable groups or families, in motel accommodation—consistent with a long history of the Howard government doing exactly the same. The Howard government accommodated asylum seekers in the Comfort Inn Asti in Darwin for many years. The Howard government accommodated asylum seekers in the Colonial inn in Brisbane. The Howard government accommodated asylum seekers in the Arkaba Hotel in Adelaide. And the Howard government accommodated asylum seekers in Quest apartments in various states. So it may come as a surprise to you, Senator Brandis, but this is long-established government policy for dealing with vulnerable groups and families.</para>
<para>We make no apologies that we do not put children behind barbed wire; we actually try to find appropriate accommodation. In the Howard government’s latter years, you also took to trying to find more appropriate accommodation on some occasions. I am told that in 2004 the Howard government was spending approximately $80,000 per month to house a mother and child in the Arkaba Hotel in Adelaide. So, yes, consistent with past governments’ practice, where appropriate we have accommodated children and their accompanying families in motel accommodation.</para>

What he was doing was explaining the processes that have been in place for many years for housing people in hotel and motel accommodation. I am advised that advice was provided to the appropriate education and police authorities in Queensland about arrangements for housing of this particular group, that the normal arrangements with some of the relevant community organisations have been in place, and that large numbers of people have been informed of those arrangements where relevant.

<para>—Thank you, Senator Marshall. This is a very, very important question, and I have heard already from the opposition their view about these things. Once again we see them in action: before the question is asked, they of course have the answers. They do not really appreciate that small business is the backbone of the economy; that there are some 2.4 million small businesses in Australia and they generate the jobs and the wealth right across the economy. It is quite clear that the opposition are not interested in their welfare.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Small business is an engine of innovation and a critical source of fresh ideas and new techniques. That is why this government has been working to support and strengthen small businesses since day one. That support continues in the government’s tax plan for our future. This is a plan that includes an early tax cut for small companies which will see a fall from 30c to 28c in 2012-13, two years ahead of a similar reduction in the general company tax rate. This measure will benefit some 720,000 small companies. It will deliver a direct financial benefit and a direct boost to cash flow. Importantly, it will give small companies an incentive to retain profits and to use them to build capabilities and to expand their activities. The government’s tax plan for our future will introduce an instant asset write-off for small businesses. Under this plan, small businesses will be able to get an immediate write-off of items worth up to $5,000. That means that— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This government has made a priority of providing tax relief and of reducing the complexity of the tax system for small businesses. We want to see these businesses prosper and grow, so we want to be able to provide assistance for a company that is providing a machine tool within a factory, if they are a manufacturer; a fridge in a cafe; or IT equipment for an office. That is why the new depreciation benefits will directly flow to businesses such as those.</para>

<para>—I am sure Senator Marshall has a longstanding interest in these areas, Senator Abetz. Enterprise Connect is about building small business innovation capacity. Commercialisation Australia is about turning small business inventions and discoveries into moneymaking goods and services. It is about turning good ideas into good jobs. Commercialisation Australia provides support for accessing skills and knowledge, for encouraging experienced executives—actually engaging them by paying CEOs—and for accessing new concepts and early-stage commercialisation activities.</para>

<para>Early-stage commercialisation support is available to firms who are turning over less than $20 million a year, and other components are made available to firms who are turning over less than $10 million. All of these measures come together.

<para>—It is quite clear from that question that not only is the opposition, frankly, not interested in discussing serious issues about the future economic development of this country; but they have already determined that position of opposition. This measure that the government is introducing in terms of our tax reform is about increasing job opportunities. It is about increasing the opportunities for new investment in the mining sectors. In the context of the changes we are making right across the system, it is about making sure Australian business is more competitive. It is about building on our strengths and it is about ensuring that we have the investment opportunities in the future. It is absolutely consistent with what is happening around the globe. It is absolutely consistent with the changes that are occurring. The modelling has shown that under this new arrangement mining investment will rise by 4.5 per cent, jobs by seven per cent and mining production by 5.5 per cent in the long run. What we have is an opposition that are going to take an obstructionist position no matter what is said.</para>

Bearing in mind that Australia has one of the lowest organ donation rates in the developed world and that the figure has not improved for some time, and the fact that the government has now established the Organ and Tissue Authority with a budget of $150 million over four years, the purpose of which is to seek to improve this donation rate, can the minister please comment on the report that in fact the donation rate in Australia has not significantly improved? There are reports that it has in fact decreased. Could the minister inform the Senate as to whether it is correct that the number of organ donations in this country has not improved, and in fact may be decreasing, and if this is correct why has it not improved?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Siewert for her question. I add to the question in this way: an acting interim CEO of the authority for organ and tissue donation was appointed on 17 March. That person is an experienced senior official and is continuing to spearhead the authority’s work. It is about ensuring that the government’s $151.1 million organ donation package is implemented successfully and in accordance with all government legal requirements. The previous CEO stated that she had left for personal reasons. Although we have now got a new package of $151.1 million, together with a new CEO, it is recognised that, while transplant success rates in Australia are among the best in the world, organ and tissue donation rates remain comparatively low. Over the past 10 years Australia has averaged around 10 donors per million of population. The current rate of 11 donors per million of population compares to 15 in the UK and over 20 in the US. It is for this reason that the government is spending the $151.1 million to create a world’s best practice and nationally consistent system for organ and tissue donation in Australia. The implementation plan and focus of the measure reflects the Sharelife Australia plan. There are encouraging early signs in providing information about how this reform is progressing. In the first quarter of this year there were 88 organ donors resulting in 251 life-transforming transplantations. That is the highest number for this period than any other year in the past decade. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—As I have been outlining, the government has put together a package. We recognise that organ and tissue donation rates have remained comparatively low in relation to other countries. I indicated in the principal answer that we have also implemented a plan to focus on the measures and to reflect the Sharelife Australia plan. I also indicated that the early signs are promising. In the past two years we have also averaged over 50 donors more than for the last 10 years before that. So the signs are encouraging, but it is recognised that comparatively they still remain low. Clearly, to improve donation rates we must change two things: first, hospitals need systems and staff of the right capacity and expertise to enable organ and tissue donations and, second—one of the most important—Australians need to be empowered with the information necessary to make informed choices. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I thank Senator Siewert for her question. We have already made very good progress in laying the foundation for change in public hospitals. That is the first step in meeting that first requirement. We have appointed over 150 staff dedicated to improving Australia’s donation rates in 76 major public hospitals around the country and we have established organ and tissue donation agencies with specialist organ donor coordinators in all jurisdictions. We have launched a clinical trigger tool in hospitals across the country to assist clinical staff in the identification of potential donors and we have developed a new funding stream for hospitals to ensure costs are not a barrier to organ donations. To complement the work in hospitals, the Organ and Tissue Authority is also tackling the required change in community perception which, as I said, was the second area we have to address. To do that, we are launching a national advertising campaign in May 2010 to promote the need for families— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

They are opposing the expansion of superannuation concessions for low-income earners. They are opposing support for small business in terms of the depreciation arrangements. They are opposing the infrastructure spending that we are proposing with regard to $5.6 billion over the next decade. They are opposed, of course, to the resource exploration rebates and they are opposed to the cuts in company taxation.

<para>—I thank Senator Bishop for his ongoing interest in this portfolio area. The NBN is an historic nation-building project, the positive economic and social effects of which will be felt for generations to come. Last week we released in full the implementation study into the NBN. This study was undertaken by McKinsey and Co. and KPMG. It is highly rigorous and detailed, at over 500 pages and with 84 recommendations for government. It covers a range of critical areas including issues around the technology, financing, ownership, policy framework and future market structure.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The study confirmed that high-speed broadband over a wholesale-only network for all Australians is achievable and can be built on a financially viable basis with affordable prices for consumers. In fact, the study finds that in a number of areas it is possible not only to meet but also to exceed the government’s original objectives. It finds that the original $43 billion total capital cost estimate is conservative and at the high end of the plausible range and identifies a number of opportunities to reduce the bill’s cost. It recommends taking the fibre footprint further than the government originally intended from 90 to 93 per cent and covering the 1.3 million new premises expected to be built to 2017-18. In effect this means the study recommends taking fibre to an extra 1.6 million premises. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Regrettably I must advise the Senate that I am not aware of any alternative policies to ensure that all Australians have access to high-speed broadband. Even before the implementation study was released the opposition announced they would scrap the NBN. This took opposition for opposition’s sake to a whole new level. After 2½ years in opposition those opposite still do not have an alternative broadband plan, which is no surprise, given they are on their third shadow minister. The opposition plan to stop building the NBN would risk Australia’s economic future. The NBN is crucial economic infrastructure. Without it Australian companies will not be able to compete with the likes of Japan, South Korea and Singapore. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talk.start>
<para>It is not often that I applaud the judgment of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, but this morning’s headline says it all: ‘SMEs win in new R&amp;D tax breaks plan’. There will be a 45 per cent refundable tax credit for companies turning over less than $20 million and a 40 per cent non-refundable tax credit for all other companies. The 45 per cent credit doubles the base rate of support available to small- and medium-sized enterprises from 7½c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar. That is equivalent to a 150 per cent tax concession. The 40 per cent non-refundable tax offset raises the base rate for large companies by a third, from 7½c to 10c in the dollar. It is equivalent to a 133 per cent tax concession. Small, innovative firms are big winners from the new R&amp;D tax credit. They will enjoy more generous rates of assistance and better access to cash refunds for their R&amp;D expenditure, and under the present arrangements a company in tax loss turning over $10 million and spending $1 million on eligible R&amp;D might eventually receive a tax deduction of $375,000 when it turns a profit.

The R&amp;D tax concession is a great Labor reform and, of course, in its day was obviously a matter of urgent need, but it is now time for a replacement. Those opposite halved its value and ignored the problems that emerged over time in its administration. They have a legacy whereby a mining company that does $20 million worth of R&amp;D is able to claim $500 million for normal mine operations and mineral exploration associated with R&amp;D. They might have a situation under present arrangements where a construction company that does $15 million worth of R&amp;D on air-conditioning systems can potentially claim the $100 million cost of construction of a whole building on the grounds— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Senator Sterle, the people of Western Australia are listening today, and you should be ashamed of yourself. Stand up for the people of Western Australia; do not sit back there and cop what Mr Rudd is going to do to our state, which is to well and truly finish it off. This is nothing more and nothing less than a blatant tax grab by the Rudd Labor government.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The bottom line with those opposite is that you are part of a big-spending, economically irresponsible government, and the only reason that you need to tax the living daylights out of the industry that is this country is that you have record levels of debt, which has soared up, and you need to satiate your out-of-control spending. Mr Rudd claimed he was a fiscal conservative prior to the 2007 election. I tell you the Australian people are not laughing at that, because they actually took him on his word, and he blatantly misrepresented himself. It is the Australian people who are now going to have to pay back the debt that the government have incurred.</para>
<para>But the bad new for the Australian people is they will not have jobs. They will not have jobs because you are going to destroy the industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people in this country. The joke going around at the moment—and this is from Labor people back in my home state—is that Mr Rudd is the worst prime minister since Billy McMahon. Then the Labor people offer their apologies to Billy McMahon for actually putting him in the same category as the underachiever, Mr Rudd. Mr Rudd is nothing more and nothing less than an underachiever. He is going to destroy this country. He is dangerous for Australia.</para>
<para>This so-called superprofits rent tax will have dire consequences for the industry in Australia which is the most significant to this country, and dire consequences will flow on to the Australian economy. You have to begin to worry when the Canadians actually send a delegation over here to work out what investment they will take as it is driven offshore. Chinese companies are on the record as already redirecting investment to Africa, Asia and South America. And, in relation to the impact on the average Australian, forget about the so-called increase in superannuation; no amount of increase in the superannuation levy is going to make up for the damage that you have done to superannuation investment with your announcement. This new superprofits tax will discourage investment in our mining industry, put projects at risk and send jobs overseas. But what is new with you lot over there?</para>

<para>—I know I have only five minutes—I would love to have a lot longer, and my turn will come—but there are a few things that I think we need to correct for the record. As a proud Western Australian who made my living on the back of supplying the mining towns in the far north and the goldfields, I think there is no more important industry, certainly in Western Australia, than mining. I am not belittling our other industries, which employ a lot of people, but I think we have to clear up the hysterics from the other side and unfortunately from News Corp et cetera—they love to run the hysterics too.</para>

<para>There are a lot of mistruths and ridiculous figures being espoused around the country about how many workers we may need, should these projects go to final investment decision. With the great work of the task force, which includes mining representation, gas representation, tertiary education representation and construction representation, the best figure which has been agreed to by the members of the task force is that we would probably need about 80,000 construction workers if these projects were to go to final investment decision. As best as we can ascertain, those 80,000 workers would be needed in the next five to 10 years. Of that, we would need some estimated 30,000 production workers to run those plants. That is a far cry from the figures that we have heard today.</para>
<para>The <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>—and it is fine newspaper—has unfortunately been conned or fooled by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia into thinking that, in a state with a population of some two million, in the next seven years we will need some 441,000 workers just in WA. I can tell you now, Mr Acting Deputy President—and it is on the record—that, if you were to check with the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, with the Minerals Council of Australia, with APIA or with whomever else you may want to check, you would find that that figure is absolute nonsense.</para>
<para>To come back to the figures that have been thrown around today—and you can see where the hysteria and the hype come from—they go off the record and become absolutely ridiculous. I encourage opposition senators, if they are going to get up and speak for the big end of town, to do a couple of things. One, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you on the other side have financial interests or shares in any of these mining companies or resource companies, the decent thing to do would be to declare it before you start ranting and raving and attacking the Rudd government. That is a process of the Senate, one which I would follow if I had those shares or those interests, which I do not.</para>

<para>—Straight out of North Korea—exactly! It is a $9 billion tax. Those on the other side should be honest about this and tell the Senate that this is about a $9 billion tax collection to pay the interest on the debt that the Rudd government has accumulated. We are today looking at a $140 billion gross debt. In simple figures, five per cent on $140 billion is $7 billion. But, wait, there’s more: the debt has grown by more than $1 billion a week.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What this is about is tonight’s budget. It is so that the Treasurer can say, ‘We are bringing the deficit down; we are bringing $9 billion extra in every year by strangling the goose that lays the golden egg in Australia.’ That is what this is about. This is the industry about which Mr Rudd, prior to the 2007 election, said: ‘We must change our economy; we cannot be reliant on the mining industry. If it falls over and commodity prices crash, we need to have another source of income.’ What is he depending on? It was the mining industry, but now he is depending on taxing it as much as he can. I find this amazing. This is simply a great big tax to finance the great big debt.</para>
<para>We know where the great big debt came from. We can talk about Building the Education Revolution and the waste of money there. You will hear more about that in the near future, despite the Auditor-General’s report. We can talk about the waste in the pink batts fiasco, where we had a $2.6 billion program which is now costing $1 billion to clean the mess up. That is what this tax on the mining industry is about: collecting money to pay for the huge debt that the Rudd Labour government put our nation into. But that is nothing new: look back at the history of Labor, whether it be at the state level or the federal level, and tell me of one Labor government that, when they were thrown out of government, had reduced debt.

<para>Who owns those industries? Who owns Rio Tinto? Who owns BHP? The workers of Australia, those with superannuation, own them. What we are doing is strangling the future, the retirement fund for the working families, the working Australians that the people on the other side of the parliament are supposed to represent. You are strangling their retirement, because they are the people who own those industries. One accountant has given me figures today saying that 10 to 20 per cent of investment portfolios are directly in mining shares—for example, BHP and Rio Tinto. So you are strangling the workers’ retirement funds. You have already seen the damage that you have done to the stock market because of the announcement of this huge tax on that industry.</para>
<para>There is one thing that is interesting: when this tax is brought in and implemented by the Rudd government, Australia will pay about twice the tax of the mining industries in Canada, Brazil and China, yet we are expected to compete. What we are going to see—and we have already seen it—is the pulling out of investment and of exploration. Companies will tend towards South Africa, Indonesia, Brazil—you name it—anywhere where there are fewer costs so they can get the same product and make more profit. That is how free enterprise is. What this government is doing is simply scaring business out of our nation.</para>
<para>The one concern I really have is the fertiliser industry. Incitec Pivot have told the Stock Exchange that they will stop drilling for phosphate as a result of Labor’s new mining supertax. We have been importing our fertiliser onto our farms for years and here is an opportunity to have our own fertiliser in Australia and get a distinct benefit for our nation, but our Incitec people have said, ‘What’s the point of going ahead; we’ve been taxed out of existence.’ That is what this tax is going to do, and that is why we on this side of the parliament will oppose it from the very beginning until Mr Rudd does another backflip and does away with it.</para>

<para>—I have to say that, in the last 20 minutes, the debate around this issue has been characterised very much in the sorts of contributions we have had from senators across the way. It has been extraordinarily hysterical, and it has been littered with misinformation. Unfortunately, Senator Williams, you are leaving the chamber. It would have been an opportunity, potentially, for you to get some clarity on what this tax is about. The government’s tax reforms are about making Australia a more attractive investment destination, including for the resources sector.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The resource superprofit tax is designed to ensure that Australians get a fair share from valuable non-renewable resources. Resource taxing is a better way to tax resources because it taxes only the profits and it fully recognises the large investments made in mining. A tax such as this rebates state royalties. Royalty and excises are based on volume or value and they do not rise with profits. It is important to remember that in 2008-09 the resource sector generated close to $90 billion of superprofits. Superprofits are profits above what a competitive business would normally expect to earn. In that same year state royalties and Commonwealth excise returned only $12.3 billion to the Australian budgets. The effect of these proposals is in fact a rebalancing. Ten years ago Australians, through their government, received $1 out of every $3 of profit reaped by the resource sector. Today it is $1 in every $7 of superprofit. Surely that needs some attention.</para>

<para>—I will go back to that, although I did explain. They are profits above what a competitive business would normally expect to return. As I said, 10 years ago $1 in every $3 of profit was returned to Australians from rental on a non-renewable resource. Today it is $1 in $7.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Profit based taxation does work. For example, the 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax has existed for over 20 years. The $50 billion Gorgon project was approved under the 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax. To say that it does not work is simply a furphy. In fact, I encourage leaders of the large mining companies and LNG producers to work with our government to roll out the delivery of the resource superprofit tax for our community.</para>
<para>It is important to remember also that there have been many economists who do not oppose the introduction of this tax. I look to Professor John Quiggan’s commentary on this issue. He goes through a range of arguments about why it is a good idea—a sensible, fair and equitable idea—to introduce a profit tax rather than user royalties and excise. I think his most compelling argument is where he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The political economy argument. Ever since I can remember, and probably before that, mining companies have been threatening to pack their bags and go overseas. They’ve made these threats when they were upset about tax policy, about environmental restrictions, about Aboriginal land rights, about union wage demands and work practices and when they were in a bad mood for no particular reason. But, even though lots of Australian industries have disappeared, or contracted drastically for a range of reasons, the miners are still here. The reason is obvious. They can leave but they can’t take the minerals with them. It’s precisely this immobility that underlies the case for—</para>

<para>—I rise to take note of the pathetic effort by Minister Carr to try to defend Prime Minister Rudd’s absolutely indefensible supertax on the mining industry in this country. In recent weeks, the Prime Minister has made Australia the laughing-stock of the world. He has put Australia in the situation where the Canadian Minister of Finance, Jim Flaherty, has indicated Canada will now have a tremendous competitive advantage. That minister is over here looking for opportunities. There has been a massive reduction in the value of Australian resource companies in the last week and a half. With it, we have seen a massive erosion in the value of superannuation and shares for Australian retirees and Australian workers—the very people those opposite should be standing up for and defending.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Amongst other things, the Prime Minister has vilified foreign investment in this country. When since 1788 did we use anything other than foreign investment to support and grow industries in this country? As has previously been said, we are already seeing the major mining companies walk away, close up investments and close up opportunities. We now have the Prime Minister and the Treasurer saying, ‘Why don’t they come and talk to us?’ Surely they learnt something from the emissions trading scheme—that is, that they should have gone and spoken to those companies in advance.</para>
<para>We have had figures presented to us in the last few minutes, but let me give you the figures from the Australian Taxation Office on the contribution of the mining sector to this country. According to the ATO, the resources sector pays 13 per cent more tax than any other sector in this country. In the last year alone, the resources sector paid to Australian governments, federal and state, $22 billion. When added to the $22 billion surplus that this government inherited from the previous government, they have squandered $44 billion plus, plus and plus.</para>
<para>Do not go past what the <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal</inline> said last week. It said, ‘This economic thinking runs counter to everything that has made Australia rich.’ So what have we seen in recent times? We have seen losses. The super funds of retirees and working Australians have gone out the window. Seven hundred thousand Australians have shares in BHP, quite apart from those who have super funds. We just heard the senator opposite speak about the petroleum resource rent tax. Does she not understand this: firstly, it is a tax at the government bond rate plus five per cent, and it is only a prospective tax not a retrospective tax; secondly, the offshore oil and gas industry does not pay royalties to any states. In the petroleum resource rent tax we have this factored in. This stupid tax is being set at the bond rate, currently six per cent. I invested some money the other day for an elderly relative in a nursing home. I rang my bank and they said, ‘We’ll give you six per cent while that person does absolutely nothing for it.’</para>
<para>What an absolute joke this is. We have been made a laughing-stock. Only in the last week have we learnt about the $170 billion of projects in the mining and resource sector and the 500 companies—not just one, two, three or four big companies. As the Queensland Labor Premier and the South Australian Labor Premier have both said in recent days: ‘This is a disastrous tax; it has got to be reversed.’ Let us look at Labor’s gambling for a moment. Under this new tax, this nationalising of the Australian mining industry, we have the government sharing the profits.</para>

<para>—But also, if Senator Cameron would take note, they will potentially share the losses. Mining is a very fraught industry, as we all know. The situation we will have into the future—and the Australian taxpayers need to know this—is that the government have forced themselves on the mining companies and the government will be paying out losses of up to 40 per cent, as mining companies do not always make profits. If ever there has been a widening of the difference between Labor and Liberal, we have it in the way the cake is made. Labor divides up the cake until it becomes crumbs; Liberals grow the cake to improve it for everybody. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—On 15 April this year News Limited newspapers ran an item on turnover in ministerial staff offices in this government. In a graphic alongside the article it stated that I had lost some 50 per cent of my staff. The journalist claimed that I had allegedly lost eight staff because I was ‘a tough minister’. The journalist, Mr Lewis, stated that he had calculated the turnover in staff by tracking changes in personnel in various internal phonebooks over 2008 to 2010. He did not include the departure of departmental liaison officers but did include departures in electorate office staff.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I want to say very clearly that there are flaws in Mr Lewis’s methodology. It failed to take into account transitional temporary positions supplied by departments and internal shifts between ministers’ offices. After the election, temporary staff provided by departments remained on deck for weeks or even months while permanent positions were filled. Since my own portfolio changed in June 2009 from Special Minister of State and Cabinet Secretary to Minister for Defence such temporary positions were factored in twice. This would also have occurred to the staffing component of perhaps some of my other colleagues but I cannot speak on their behalf.</para>
<para>I just want to place the facts on record in this personal explanation: 33 people, permanent and temporary, have worked for me as Special Minister of State or Minister for Defence. Two were ADCs and seven were temporary staff supplied by the respective department. So I have had 24 staff work on a permanent basis—that is, staff employed under the MOP(S) Act. After becoming defence minister two left and four others went to other offices in the building, rather than leave the service of the Rudd government. Two of those in fact went to the Prime Minister’s office. So the portfolio change accounted for six staff changes.</para>

<para>—You did indeed, Senator Ludwig. I did not mention that but it is true because you took over my previous responsibilities. That is six out of 24—25 per cent. On the other hand, my staffing component has increased from 13 to 18, and I am including the defence ADC in that.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I do not want to be misunderstood in this personal explanation. I think it is the job of the media to probe these issues, as I and my former colleague, former Senator Robert Ray, did for many years in Senate estimates. It is an important accountability mechanism to ensure that offices do not get bloated with political operatives, extra departmental liaison officers or the like. But I do say this: to jump to false conclusions, present speculation as fact and not acknowledge the spills that occur during portfolio changes is not very good form. I do not think it presents the full picture.</para>
<para>Like all my colleagues, I am grateful to all the people who have worked as ministerial staff, present and past, and I would obviously acknowledge that working for a minister is hard, demanding and not everybody’s cup of tea. It is also a public service which progresses our nation and, for some, it is very rewarding. For the record, I have employed 24 permanent staff over 18 months. I have had six staff changes; four of whom went to work in other offices in a change of portfolio. I would calculate the staff turnover at 25 per cent, not 50 per cent—and two happily went to work for the Prime Minister.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate records its deep regret at the death on 13 April 2010, of Bernard Francis Kilgariff, OAM, AM, former senator for the Northern Territory, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Bernie, as he was known, was born in Adelaide in 1923 but moved to Alice Springs with his family as a young boy. He was the first Territory student to achieve a year 10 intermediate certificate.</para>
<para>After he finished school, Bernie served in the Australian Army during the Second World War. He fought in Papua New Guinea in the 2nd/5th Battalion, 6th Division of the Australian Imperial Force. Upon his return, he became very active in his local community and was well known for being one of the first tourism entrepreneurs in the Alice.</para>
<para>Bernie had a distinguished career representing the people of Alice Springs, starting when he was appointed to the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory in 1960. He served in the Legislative Council until 1968, at which point he continued as a member of the new Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory until 1975. He was Speaker for two years until he was elected to federal parliament as one of the first two senators for the Northern Territory in 1975.</para>
<para>Bernie campaigned hard for the establishment of self-government for the Northern Territory, which was achieved in July 1978, and he remained a vocal advocate for statehood for the Northern Territory for the rest of his life. I am sure that Senator Scullion will have more personal reflections on what was clearly a very committed and active life advocating for the Northern Territory.</para>
<para>Bernie remained in the Senate until 1987 and played a significant role in the formation of the Country Liberal Party. During his time in parliament, he served on a number of Senate legislative and general purpose standing committees as well as a number of Senate select and joint committees. He was also a member of parliamentary delegations to China, Japan, Romania, the former USSR and Hungary in 1978; Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates in 1982; and Thailand and Indochina in 1984.</para>
<para>It is worth noting that, during Bernie’s 27-year political career, he never once lost an election. Not many of us can say that. In 1989, Bernie was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia and, in 1996, he was elevated to a Member of the Order of Australia. The recognition was for continued service to the Northern Territory through the Northern Territory Landcare Council, the Anti-Rabbit Research Foundation, the Cattlemens Association, the Australia Day Council and St John Ambulance. He was also invested as a Knight of the Order of St John. In 2001, he received the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through the parliament.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, Bernie passed away on 13 April this year. He will be fondly remembered for his passion for politics and his lifelong commitment to the people and causes of the Northern Territory. Fittingly, he was accorded a state funeral at Alice Springs.</para>
<para>On behalf of the government, I offer our condolences to the family of Bernard Francis Kilgariff, particularly to his wife, Aileen, and their many children: Danny, Andrew, Frances, Helen, Claire, Brian, Anne, Michael, Kathryn and John. It is a full life well lived and a tremendous record of contribution to public service.</para>

<para>—On behalf of coalition senators, I too extend our sincere condolences to the family of former Senator Bernie Kilgariff, a senator for the Northern Territory and a member of the Country Liberal Party, who died on 13 April this year at the age of 86, after a long and very rich life. His contributions have set the bar high for those who follow. His life was full in so many ways. His life was inspirational and a living expression of the coalition philosophy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Kilgariff was one of the modern pioneers of Central Australia and was instrumental in the formation of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. He was born at Mile End in South Australia in 1923 and arrived with his family in Alice Springs at the age of seven.</para>
<para>He went on to make extensive contributions to the outback, pastoral, aviation, construction and resource industries, defence, tourism, Aboriginal affairs and the community—all in partnership, with the support and encouragement of his wife, Aileen, and their 11 children. I note: no baby bonus or paid parental leave was needed here. His 11 children were undoubtedly a great apprenticeship for his later role as whip of coalition senators.</para>
<para>Mr Kilgariff’s political career started in 1960 in the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory. He went on to become the first Speaker of the first fully-elected Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory in 1974 and then, in 1975, he was elected as one of the first Territory senators and one of the first senators to represent the newly-formed Country Liberal Party. From 1979 he represented the Liberal Party. I recall meeting with the then senator when I was a very young President of the Australian Liberal Students Federation seeking support for voluntary student unionism, which I note was finally achieved about four or five years ago. I had the privilege of steering the legislation through this place, never expecting it would take so long.</para>
<para>Mr Kilgariff retired from politics in 1987 and continued contributing to every facet of the community for the rest of his life. His contributions were rightly recognised through the Order of Australia. He received the Medal of the Order, OAM, and the Member of the Order, AM, in 1996. On receiving the Order of Australia, Mr Kilgariff said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It sounds corny, but the biggest pleasure of my career has been representing people.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Kilgariff exemplified commitment to and engagement with the community. He genuinely wanted the Northern Territory—and I quote from his maiden speech in the Senate in 1996—to be ‘capable of performing mighty feats which will be to the benefit not only of the Territory but of Australia’. He was a devoted servant to the parliament and the Northern Territory.</para>
<para>To Mr Kilgariff’s widow, Aileen, and his children and grandchildren, the coalition extend our sympathy in their bereavement and place on record our appreciation of his public service throughout his life. I know Senator Scullion, who so ably represents the Northern Territory and the Country Liberal Party in the Senate, will provide additional supportive comments.</para>

<para>—I rise to join the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in the condolence motion for the loss of former Senator Bernard Kilgariff. All Australians should honour the enormous contribution of my mate, one of the Northern Territory’s first politicians and the founder of the Country Liberal Party, Bern Kilgariff, who was born on 30 September 1923 and sadly passed away on 13 April this year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Bern had a lifetime of outstanding community contribution and was well liked by people from both sides of the political divide, representing the Northern Territory as the first Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and as the Territory’s first senator. In 1929 he arrived in Alice Springs with his family on one of the first Ghan trains from Adelaide. I was very lucky, particularly in the first few years of the Senate, to enjoy some of the stories that Bern used to tell about his early days growing up in Alice Springs. As you can imagine, it really was a joy to see Alice Springs in the late 1920s and early 1930s through the eyes of someone who had spent so much time there and seen so much change.</para>
<para>Bern went on to serve in the Australian Army during the Second World War, built and operated motels and service stations in Alice Springs, turned his hand to farming and pastoralism and was instrumental in opening up Central Australia to tourism. He was a very experienced guy. If you spent any time with him and there was a bit of old agricultural equipment or a car of some age he would straightaway tell you how they had improved that part. I often used to say, because he was so knowledgeable, ‘What’s that bit there?’ And he would say that that was a such and such and it used to hang off the something or other. He always had such an intimate knowledge of almost every aspect of life. Certainly in the pastoral industry, he was somebody who looked back with some sadness at the changes in the opportunities that presented to our first Australians. He reflected on a time when Aboriginals in Central Australia were the absolute backbone of the pastoral industry and saw with some sadness that they no longer enjoyed the same opportunities they had when he first got there.</para>
<para>One might wonder whether there was anything, as an individual, that Bernie could not do. We need only to look at some of the positions he held in the Northern Territory. He was Chairman of the Northern Territory Housing Commission, Director of the Central Australian Travel Association, President of the Alice Springs Art Foundation and Chair of the Alice Springs Community College. In 1974 he founded the Country Liberal Party—and, in this place, we may appreciate the difficulty of that. He was instrumental in securing for that party, as a brand new party, 17 of the 19 seats in the first Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election. I do not think it matters what side of parliament we are from; we must all acknowledge that as an incredible feat. Bern, they certainly were the halcyon days, mate!</para>
<para>Bern was very passionate about the Northern Territory. I can remember, when on the few occasions a keynote speech I gave in the Northern Territory did not include statehood, he would come up to me and remind me very forcibly that I had forgotten the first principle—that if we were ever talking about the Northern Territory we needed to remember that statehood was an absolutely fundamental part of the future. Bern, it is never far from our minds, mate.</para>
<para>Bern was recognised in a number of ways, including being given the Order of Australia. I think he would have reflected on how wonderful that was, but I know that in 2008 being invested as a Knight in the Order of St John, specifically for his contribution to the St John Ambulance service, would also have given him a great deal of joy.</para>
<para>He was also named Senior Australian of the Year for the Northern Territory in 2003. That acknowledgement was a reflection of how Bernie, even in his later years, was a very active person in the community, continuing to advocate right across the board. I still remember that at any time I could get a phone call with his voice on the other end saying: ‘Nigel, it’s Bernie. Just a couple of ideas.’ He would then go into some aspect of politics or his thoughts of the day. He was always worth listening to. He had an incredible mind and often had a different angle that you would never have thought of. In politics it is very refreshing to see somebody who has such a wonderful insight into Australian life, and I am sure that was a reflection of his great experience.</para>
<para>Those people who knew Bern will know that one of his most famous sayings about opportunity was, ‘If a tram goes past, hop on it and see where it takes you.’ As I have moved around Australia—not just the Northern Territory—I have found that as soon as someone knows I am a senator and I am from the Northern Territory they say, ‘You’d know Bern Kilgariff.’ I would say, ‘Yes, of course I know Bernie,’ and we would have some sort of conversation. Bern’s tram took him right around Australia and right around the world. He had a great many opportunities. He took every single one. I think the hundreds of people who turned out at Bernie’s state funeral in Alice Springs last month were a reflection of that. It was a fantastic funeral. It was a fitting farewell to a man who contributed so much to his community and so much to his country. I would like to extend my condolences to Bernie’s wife, Aileen, and to his family, who lost a wonderful husband, father and grandfather.</para>

<para>—by leave—I would like to make some brief remarks. It was a great pleasure of mine to meet the local member for Holt, Bill Yates—as he was known to us all—in 1975, when I first joined the party. It was a memorable year, because it was the last year of the former Whitlam government. Bill was a flamboyant man and a man of incredible intellectual rigour, integrity and common decency who has left a lasting legacy in the Liberal Party and one that his family should be enormously proud of.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It brings a smile to my face to remember the first times that I met him, when we were holding local Holt electorate meetings in my family’s home. He was the only member of the House of Representatives who could claim that he had served both in the House of Commons and here in the Australian parliament. As a Conservative member of the House of Commons he was one of the government’s staunchest critics during the 1956 Suez Canal crisis, which saw the downfall of then British Prime Minister Eden. Holding a marginal seat, he was later defeated at the polls in the general election of 1966 and soon thereafter moved to Australia. Putting his marginal seat campaigning skills to the test, he stood for the seat of Holt in 1975 and secured a nine per cent swing to the Liberal Party and held the seat of Holt for two terms. He was a much appreciated, revered and combatant local member and was known to be a very eloquent advocate not only for the constituency of Holt but also here in Canberra. He was also very well known as the beekeeper of the Australian parliament and was known for the hives he kept in the grounds of Parliament House. He used to frequently share his observations on the merits of bees both for the pure honey produce and for the therapeutic effects, if you like, of the bee stings themselves.</para>
<para>It was later, when I entered this place, that I reconnected with him. He had moved to country Victoria to a place called Tallangatta. He would frequently get in touch with me and share his views on a number of subjects, very excited that one of his earlier branch members had ended up in this place. It was at the ripe old age of 82 that he undertook his doctorate in political science. So he did not take his retirement very seriously at all. In fact, rather than enjoying the simpler things in life, he worked very hard until the end. He had good reason to be very proud of his family. His family have great reason to be very proud of his achievements. The condolences and best wishes of all in the Liberal Party, but particularly those of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party, are sent to all his family.</para>

<para>—by leave—As a fellow Queenslander, I want to make some remarks on the sad death only last week of former member for Bowman Andrea West. Andrea West died at a very young age, comparatively speaking. She was born in 1952, so it would have been her 58th birthday later this year. Sadly, she has been taken from us. Andrea West served only one term in the House of Representatives, as the member for Bowman. She was one of the landslide that elected the Howard government in 1996 and she was one of the several members of the coalition parties who lost their seats at the 1998 election. I knew Andrea West reasonably well. She was a well-known and well-liked figure in the Queensland Liberal Party and she had a very long Liberal lineage in Queensland, because she was the daughter of Bill Kaus. Bill Kaus was a member of the state parliament. He was the member for Mansfield throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s. So Andrea came from very good Liberal bloodlines.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>She was a very generous and a gracious person. She was one of those heroic people who, knowing that they were clinging onto a very marginal seat after the 1996 election, nevertheless strongly supported the GST—the proposal that John Howard took to the 1998 election to seek the people’s mandate. Some of those members, particularly for very marginal seats, must have known, as turned out to be the case, that by supporting the GST—a proposal that had never been successfully introduced by an incumbent government without suffering loss at the following election anywhere in the Western world at that stage—she was imperilling her own future. But she, along with several other Liberal-National Party colleagues, was prepared to put the national interest and her beliefs and her principles ahead of her own self-interest. So she supported this what promised to be a very unpopular measure. She did go down to defeat in Bowman in 1998, but she was one of those people who, although they left the other place involuntarily, nevertheless left with their head held high because she had come into parliament to achieve things for Australia and, at the cost of her own political life, she contributed to bringing about that very beneficial set of policies. That is part of her legacy.</para>
<para>After her defeat Andrea West remained a member of the Liberal Party in Queensland. She was active around the branches in the Redlands area, which was where she lived, and in fact just over 10 years ago, on 30 April 2000, Andrea West was one of the candidates who stood for the casual Senate vacancy which was created by the resignation of Senator Warwick Parer. I was fortunate enough to be selected by the Liberal Party on that occasion from a field which I think it is fair to say was a strong field. Andrea West, as a rival for preselection, was the soul of courtesy and grace and decency.</para>
<para>I am sad for her passing. I am particularly sad that she has died at such a young age. Her legacy, although modest by comparison to longer political careers, is nevertheless a distinct and an honourable legacy of which she and her family can be proud. I am sure that the other four Queensland Liberal senators would wish to be associated with my remarks.</para>

<para>—This is the International Year of Biodiversity. We have on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and in other newspapers today the news that there has been a massive loss of biodiversity on the planet with over 30 per cent of wildlife gone since 1970 and an increasing loss of species, including the loss of plant species, across the planet at a totally unacceptable but accelerating rate due to human activity. The red gum forests of Australia are an heirloom of this nation, but the most recent reports are that upwards of 70 per cent of the red gums along the Murray-Darling system are dead or dying under huge stress and the process is continuing.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In the Millewa forests we have a damaged but intact ecosystem of red gums in the Murray system. We have an Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act—let me repeat that—a biodiversity conservation act which requires that there be a probity which errs on the side of protecting biodiversity. Here is an opportunity for it but the government opposes it. It is working with the New South Wales government. What does that mean? What we need to hear in the Senate is that these red gum forests will be protected and that the vigour of this government will be put into protecting this nation’s heritage against this onslaught of extinction, with Australia one of the worst-performing countries. It is time that the legislation was backed up and action was taken. I am surprised the government will not be supporting this motion.</para>

<para>—I would like to add to this debate that I have visited the red gum forests. I was down there last weekend and some six months ago. Locking up these forests and leaving them will destroy these forests—make no mistake about it. The forests have been managed for more than 150 years. They are a renewable resource. I urge Senator Brown to go down and have a look at the 900 hectares that was burned some four years ago. Red gum will not stand any fire whatsoever. When it was burned, the millers asked to remove the timber within 12 months before it cracked so that they could use it for some good. They were not allowed to do that. The locals asked to remove the dead timber to use it for firewood and to allow the growth of a new forest. They were not allowed to do that.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We now have 900 hectares of dead trees, and people call this conservation. I call it absolute destruction of our environment. You take the grazing out, you let the fuel levels build up and, once you have more than five tonnes of fuel per hectare, a 40-degree day and a 30-kilometre wind, the fire is uncontrollable. By locking this land up, just as the past Premier of New South Wales, Nathan Rees, did on the very day he was sacked as Premier, you are losing jobs and taking millions of dollars out of the economy. There is a destruction of the economy and now you are going to destroy the whole red gum forest with fire. Make no mistake about it—it will happen as sure as I speak here now if that country is locked up and left. The grasses will grow, the fuel will increase, the lightning will strike and there will be the destruction of the whole environment.</para>

<para class="block">Trust is the key currency of politics, and unless you can be trusted to honour that to which you’ve committed to do, then, I’ve got to say, you’re not going to obtain the enduring respect of the Australian people.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those prophetic words were spoken by no other than the Labor leader himself on 29 February 2008, some two years ago. Put simply, the Australian people no longer trust Labor, because Labor has not honoured the people of Australia by keeping its promises. Indeed, Labor discards its solemn promises as easily as we discard our used tissues: it spares them not another thought.</para>
<para>The list of broken promises, this shameful record, must surely be vying for a place in the <inline font-style="italic">Guinness Book of World Records</inline>. Who else could recklessly make so many inflated promises—inflated both in number and actual size—and then so dismissively walk away from them other than Labor, led by the promise-making, promise-breaking duo of Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard—and, might I add, every single Labor member and senator in this place?</para>
<para>We all recall the galling, high and mighty pontifications of the odd couple of Australian politics telling Australians that the greatest moral challenge of our time was climate change. That was why we needed their big new tax on everything by 2010: because to delay until 2011 or 2012 and go with the rest of the world was simply irresponsible. It was immoral, no less. We then had the indecency of the Prime Minister, during question time, blaming a heatwave on climate change to underscore the importance and urgency of Labor’s emissions trading scheme, only to have it delayed by one year and then out to 2013—after not only this election but the one after that as well. The great moral challenge of our time simply evaporated. Why? Because Labor never meant it. They had focus group testing and a series of phrases clearly tested very well, and they regurgitated them, but without conviction, without sincerity and without belief, but with absolute cynicism, with connivance and with manipulation of the Australian people in mind.</para>
<para>The list of cynical promises and overblown commitments that Labor took to the last election is mind blowing. Remember Fuelwatch? Treasury officials worked 37 hours straight to deliver to a cynical political agenda and delivered a policy debacle. Fresh from the humiliation of that debacle, the government simply turned to GROCERYchoice, with similar cynicism and similar results.</para>
<para>We can turn to Ms Gillard’s trifecta of debacles. Remember the huge promise of a laptop for every student? It was the toolkit of the 21st century, we were told—but it was empty and it was not connected, and the cost blew out. Let us recall the Building the Education Revolution program—just a minor blow-out there of over $1,000 million. The worst example of Ms Gillard’s trifecta was the commitment that no worker would be worse off under their industrial relations changes. Remember that? Tens of thousands of Australian workers today are worse off—some in excess of $120 per week worse off—and all Ms Gillard can say when confronted is that her new Fair Work system is working ‘as expected’. If it is truly working as expected, why didn’t Ms Gillard tell the Australian people before the last election that tens of thousands of Australian workers would be worse off? And, of course, as minister for training, Ms Gillard was responsible for the lack of training in that literally fatal debacle with the pink batts. And Ms Gillard is seen as one of Labor’s leading lights. You can see how bad they all are when somebody with such a ministerial record is seen as one of the leading lights.</para>
<para>But it will be noted that these breaches of promise are in the area of economics, workplace relations, environment, climate change, education, consumer affairs and health as well. Just witness the private health insurance rebate, which Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard so solemnly promised to keep—and discarded just as easily. Look at the non-GP superclinics.</para>
<para>We turn to family policy. Remember the chest beating about the double drop off? How outrageous that was and that the Howard government had done nothing about it! That was why we needed 260 new childcare centres all to be funded, quite responsibly, by Mr Rudd. What did they do? I think they built three and then simply dumped the policy—no apology, no contrition; just greasing their way to the next issue hoping that people would forget that which they have broken.</para>
<para>I could go to border protection. What a great promise that was: that Mr Rudd would turn the boats back in the seas. Indeed, he has welcomed them with open arms and we now see the greatest flood of illegal immigration into this country for many years—I believe, ever.</para>
<para>Then we have the Japanese whaling debacle. Remember that? We were going to take Japan to the International Court of Justice, and how weak was Mr Howard in not doing so! Unfortunately, a lot of Australian people believed that rhetoric. What have they done? Absolutely nothing other than—and here is a hint as to when the election is going to be—they will consider taking Japan to the International Court of Justice in November or thereabouts if nothing has occurred by then. We all know the election will have come and gone by November on the basis of that promise.</para>
<para>What we have with this government is all inflated brash promises based on cynicism, not on the evidence or the national interest. I make this observation: the people of Australia wanted this Labor government to succeed. The people of Australia elected them. But Labor, with a huge well of goodwill to draw upon, have failed the Australian people to the point of blatant betrayal. The Australian people now see the Labor Party for what it really is: a party without character, a party without backbone, a party without belief and a party that has betrayed—remember this phrase?—the working families of Australia. Labor and its leadership team have betrayed the Australian people.</para>

<para>—I am nearly speechless after that diatribe of completely unfactual rubbish. What a load of rubbish! In response to the matter of public importance today, I would like to make it very clear, particularly for those opposite, who seem to live in some sort of alternative history paradise, that the Australian people understand that the Rudd government has been delivering and will continue to deliver. It is doing that knowing that those sitting opposite could not and did not deliver in 11 years of government—11 years! The blatant hypocrisy of those opposite is astounding, especially with regard to the MPI for today.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When I read what the MPI was for today, I was instantly reminded of John Howard’s promise of the never, ever GST. In fact, one of the things that I think I will best remember—and a lot of other people will too—about the Howard government is the notion of ‘core’ and ‘non-core’ promises, non-core promises being the kind that you do not have to keep.</para>
<para>A classic example of this—and there were many quotes, but I have limited time today—was the doorstop interview of 2 May 1995 with John Howard and a journalist.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Journalist: So you’ve left the door open for a GST now, haven’t you?</para>
<para class="block">Howard: No, there’s no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy.</para>
<para class="block">Journalist: Never ever?</para>
<para class="block">Howard: Never ever. It’s dead. It was killed by the voters at the last election.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It makes you wonder, doesn’t it? It also makes you wonder about Mr Abbott’s ‘Work Choices is dead’ comments too. I do not think that has actually been a promise, but it does make us wonder.</para>
<para>Let us not forget John Howard’s promise that he would keep interest rates at all-time lows. History, of course, tells us a very different story there. In fact, so arrogant and out of touch were he and his government that he said Australian families had never had it better. Obviously, Australian families did not agree with him, did they?</para>
<para>Let us put this into perspective. The Rudd government have been governing since November 2007 and already we have delivered on many of our worthwhile election promises, some of which I intend to outline—</para>

<para>—Thank you, Senator Joyce! I intend to outline some of those election promises for those opposite. It comes as no surprise that those opposite want to whinge and moan. They have made a habit out of it; that is all they do. They have no policies. They have some plans, allegedly, but no policies. In fact, all we get from those on the other side is nagging, grizzling, moaning—they are like spoilt little children. We just turn off to it after a while. Where are their policies on improving the health and education systems? Where are their funding commitments to local communities? I will tell you where they are. They are not there; they are nonexistent. The complete audacity of those opposite is evidenced best by looking right here in the Senate, a Senate which is currently being obstructed by those opposite. They have nothing constructive to add. They are just opposition for opposition’s sake.</para>

<para>Being a passionate advocate for Tasmania, it does give me great pleasure to inform the Senate of some of the many funding promises that have been and will continue to be honoured by the Rudd government. Let me start with Franklin. Delivering on the Rudd government election promises in the electorate of Franklin has been the very energetic and hardworking federal member for Franklin, Julie Collins. Ms Collins has worked hard to deliver on every election commitment to the local residents of Franklin since being elected in 2007, all of which of course will be of ongoing benefit to the people across the electorate.</para>
<para>The Franklin electorate commitments included $15 million to fund construction of the Kingston bypass—tick; $12 million to fund the Huon Valley regional water scheme—tick; $10.5 million to fund stage 1 of the south-east Tasmania recycled water scheme—another tick; $5.5 million to fund the Clarence GP super clinic, about which I thought I heard the previous speaker say there was none—tick; $166,000 for the Green Tea program—yet another tick; $155,949 for the redevelopment of the Dennes Point community centre—tick; $35,000 for the Cygnet gymnasium—tick; $10,000 for the Kingborough Lions soccer club—tick; $10,000 for the Rokeby Cricket Club to install nets—tick; and $10,000 for the Port Huon Sports Centre—tick. Those are just an example of some of the promises that have been met in Tasmania. The Rudd government is delivering on its promise to the Australian people—</para>

<para>On the matter of radioactive waste, the Rudd government has been nothing short of a disaster. The government has not delivered in the spirit of or to the letter of very simple commitments that it made in the run-up to the 2007 election. So, in the context of this debate on the Rudd government’s broken promises, I want to return briefly to the heady days of the 2007 election campaign, with Kevin Rudd in opposition castigating the Howard government’s approach to radioactive waste management, which had been, I should say, appalling. But the Rudd opposition at the time—quite senior ALP spokespeople and to a person all of their Northern Territory representatives and candidates in both Houses—made very strong commitments in the area of radioactive waste.</para>
<para>Let us reflect briefly on what the promise was and what the 2007 election platform said. Chapter 5 stated:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">I was working as one of the advisers to Senator Rachael Siewert when this legislation was first rammed through the Senate towards the end of 2005, in the same sitting fortnight as the former government’s Work Choices legislation, Welfare to Work legislation, the legislation abolishing compulsory student unionism and, of course, the infamous terror laws, which are all still on the books. They found time to ram through radioactive waste dump legislation as well. Again, the ALP condemned that. They called the legislation—accurately, in my view—extreme, arrogant, heavy-handed, draconian, sorry, sordid, extraordinary and profoundly shameful. Some of these words were put to us by Senator Trish Crossin, Senator Carr and Warren Snowdon, MP. Of course, they were spot on. They took a very clear and unequivocal position on this issue into the closing months of the 2007 election campaign. So that was the promise, and exactly when has it been broken? Indeed, is there a case to say that it has been?</para>
<para>The first thing that happened subsequent to the Rudd government taking office after the 2007 election was that radioactive waste management issues were mysteriously taken out of the science portfolio, where they had been right through the period of the Howard government and well before, and given to Martin Ferguson in the resources and industry portfolio. That is a bizarre decision to make, quite honestly: to transfer radioactive waste management from the science portfolio to the resources portfolio; to give it to somebody with absolutely no expertise, no subtlety and no idea, really, about any of the commitments that had been made by the Rudd government and by its representatives in the Northern Territory and around Australia in the run-up to the election. So it was given to this minister with no background, no expertise and no willingness to follow through with the ALP’s election commitment, and we waited for several months for the government to fulfil that promise. It was pretty simple, really: repeal the legislation and replace it with something scientifically defensible that actually brings the community along, rather than simply ramming something through, as the former government had attempted. We started to get pretty edgy. This was at the time when I took my place in here, and I started testing the ALP on whether they actually would come through with this election commitment. On a couple of occasions we brought motions through here and watched the government vote against the exact same language that was in their policy document in the lead-up to the 2007 election. We were not asking them to do anything, simply to note the language in those policy commitments, but the ALP lined up against the Greens and voted against it. That was interesting.</para>
<para>In 2008, the government-dominated Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee conducted an inquiry into my private senator’s bill to fulfil the ALP’s election commitment for them: a repeal of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act. That committee did some very good work. It was very collegial. We travelled to Alice Springs, and we had hearings here in Canberra. We heard from the agencies with the lead portfolio responsibility for radioactive waste management, from the industry and from environment groups around the country with a very large membership with a strong interest in these issues. In Alice Springs we heard from some senior traditional owners from around the Territory, because at that time four sites were still under consideration and they were very strongly opposed to the approach of the former government and wanted to know why on earth the ALP had not followed through with their commitment. Senator McEwen, who is with us this afternoon, chaired that committee. We in the Australian Greens had quite a degree of affinity, and we signed on to the majority report. We had some additional comments but the recommendations flowing from that report were quite satisfactory to us in large part in that they said that the government should do what they said they would do when in opposition. The committee came out with a set of recommendations that were not perfect, as far as we were concerned, but that we could live with. We shared common ground at that time on the objective of establishing a consensual process of site selection, which looks to agreed scientific grounds for determining suitability and the centrality of community consultation and support.</para>
<para>So what exactly happened after that? Nothing at all. The first thing that the government did was to ignore the committee’s recommendation that the repeal bill be brought in to this place at the beginning of the first quarter of last year. That did not happen. It took a full year for the minister to get around to serving up what we have before us now. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was given, in the government’s view, 11 working days to inquire into to the government’s repeal bill, which in fact is nothing more than a rather shabby and amateurish cut and paste of what the former government had been proceeding with. At least with the former government you knew where you stood. What we have now with the Rudd government is exactly the same approach with an added dash of hypocrisy, because when they were in opposition they had been castigating senators and MPs on this side of the chamber for doing what they are now quite clearly doing in attempting to ram it through this place. That is indeed a broken election commitment.</para>
<para>Who cares? Who was the Labor Party making this election commitment to in the run-up to the 2007 election? Chiefly, of course, the people on the front line, the people targeted to host, against their will and without their consent, a facility hosting Australia’s most dangerous industrial waste materials—radiotoxic waste, the low-level material that ticks for a period of approximately 300 years, the long-lived intermediate level waste, the old reactor cores and the spent fuel that has been reprocessed overseas and returned to Australia, which is deadly for tens of thousands of years, for periods that will last several ice ages from now. The government are attempting to force this facility on to a cattle station 100 kilometres from Tennant Creek in a direct violation of the commitments that they made in the run-up to that election. For the people who are on the front line, and who are facing this juggernaut now in the name of Martin Ferguson, sitting in an office in Canberra planning this assault on their sovereignty and on their rights to stand up for country and culture, that election promise has been violated. For ALP voters, who during the federal election campaign put their trust in the representatives that the ALP would send to Canberra, the promise has been broken. For anybody who preferenced the ALP, including a large number of Green voters who helped carry the Rudd government into office, the promise has been broken. For environment groups, with tens of thousands of members around Australia who have taken a long interest in this and who have played an enormously important role in galvanising community support around the country for communities on the front line, the promise has been broken and for every Northern Territory citizen who thought the ALP would be able to serve up something better than what we have seen now that promise has been broken.</para>
<para>So now what we see is a 2007 election promise becoming a 2010 election liability. I see it as a very important part of my job in the remaining months, whether or not the Rudd government succeeds in blasting this flawed and disgusting piece of legislation through this place, to make sure that right around the country this is not seen as a Northern Territory issue. When the Senate committee sat in Darwin we had rallies as far away as Hobart, Perth and Melbourne, a very long way from where that Senate committee was hearing evidence from the traditional owners on the front line, from the Northern Territory Chief Minister and from people right on down the line. This is not an issue that is going to go away. This is an election commitment that will haunt the government in this election campaign.</para>

<para>—It is a little more than three years since the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kevin Rudd, planted himself in front of some rural fencing against the beautiful background of the Nambour countryside. Looking straight down the barrel of a camera, he read from a script prepared for him by an advertising agent, and he said: ‘When it comes to being an economic conservative, it is a badge I wear with pride.’ Several months later, when he delivered the Labor Party’s policy speech for the 2007 election, the line that resonated in that speech—the one line everybody will remember, though we remember it these days for a very different reason than we did then—contained the words ‘this reckless spending must stop’.</para>

<para>Mr Kevin Rudd and his team were elected by the Australian people on 24 November 2007 to be the government of Australia because the Australian people trusted them. They did not know very much about Kevin Rudd at the time, but they knew that he was a fresh face. They knew that he was a glib, articulate and, evidently, intelligent public spokesman for the Labor Party. They put their trust in him. They trusted that he was as good as his word. After he was elected, he maintained that he was a politician who could be trusted. When he spoke at the Australian War Memorial in March 2008, only five months after he was elected, Mr Kevin Rudd said:</para>

Let it not be forgotten that these are the people who wanted to make Mark Latham Prime Minister in 2004 and told us how good he was, until he was found out by the Australian people.

<para>—Of course, Senator Bushby, if he was a man of courage, he would call a double dissolution on the issue. But it is not likely now. What the Australian people have discovered about Kevin Rudd is that for him promises have no meaning. Do not worry about core promises and non-core promises. There are no such things as core promises in the Rudd government; there are merely expendable words—words that get you from one news cycle to the next but contain no integrity, no commitment and no purpose.</para>

<para>This government must be such a disappointment to its supporters, to those who serve as its ministers and those who serve as its apologists on the backbench. You must have known about this man—this man you elected as leader in extremis when you had run out of other options four years ago. The Australian people have now woken up to the fact that he cannot be trusted, that nothing he says can be believed, that he stands for nothing, that he has no core values, that he has no guiding philosophy, that he has no policy courage, that he is a hollow man and a hollow political leader.</para>
<para>This is the first Australian Prime Minister in the lifetime of anybody in this chamber today—and I am sorry to say this about a Prime Minister of this great country—about whom one must say has a character problem. You would not have said that about John Howard, loathe him or love, nor would you have said it about Paul Keating, Bob Hawke, Malcolm Fraser or Gough Whitlam, or any Australian Prime Minister I can remember. Regardless of what you thought of his policies, regardless of what you thought of his style of government, every Australian Prime Minister on both sides of politics I can remember in my lifetime was a person of character, a person steadfast in their beliefs, whatever those beliefs may have been. This man has no steadfastness in his beliefs because he has no beliefs. He has no core values and his commitment to any sense of values is nominal, transitory and temporary. He is a politician who lives from news cycle to news cycle. The hollow man, caricatured on ABC television, now leads a government tainted forever in the public mind and to be forever condemned in Australian history as the government led by the man who stood for nothing.</para>

<para>—We are a government that has faced up to enormous challenges, including a financial crisis that threatened the livelihoods of Australians right across the nation. I am proud of the way that we have faced up to these challenges. It has been done with courage, conviction and purpose. We make no apology for coming into government with a big agenda, with big aspirations for this nation and with a determination to address more than a decade of neglect of Australia’s interests under the Howard government. It was a decade where unfairness was entrenched and where the proceeds of the last resources boom were squandered while productivity stalled. It was a decade where the big issues in health and education were ignored. Under Mr Abbott’s watch $1 billion was ripped out of public hospitals and nothing was done about a chronic shortage of nurses and GPs. It was a decade where working Australians suffered the insecurity of Work Choices—a policy that Mr Abbott rules out in name but will not rule out in practice. It was a decade where the stolen generation was denied an apology and where asylum seekers were used as a football for political gain.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But I am not going to waste further time talking about the Howard years because we all know that the forthcoming election is at the core of this debate today. This debate is about what Australians want from their future government. That is why today I stand proud. Like my colleagues, I stand behind our achievements and our commitment to reform in the national interest. I know that we are well placed to deliver on our commitments. We can look forward to a bright future because we have avoided a global recession through the strong and decisive action that stimulated the economy and saved a quarter of a million jobs by investing in local communities and essential infrastructure. We are delivering on better health and hospitals, ending the blame game with the states and putting together a $15.6 billion plan, including commitments for thousands more doctors and nurses and caps on waiting times.</para>
<para>We are providing a fairer distribution of the nation’s wealth in ways that also support economic growth. For example, we have delivered a massive increase in the childcare rebate. It was a great Labor initiative that was good for families and good for the economy. We have also delivered a long overdue increase to the pension—reforms to make the pension more sustainable. We also have a plan to ensure that the surplus profits generated by this mining boom are shared, not squandered. We have a plan that will benefit all Australians through lower company taxes, especially for small businesses—</para>

We have had to fight tooth and nail for many of our reforms and the numbers in this chamber also mean that we have not won them all. Climate change remains the greatest environmental challenge of our time and one that can be fully addressed only when those opposite show the vision required to do so.</para>
<para>You talk about broken promises, but what you deliver are broken policies that have not worked—like your blame the states health policy under your leader, Mr Abbott, which ran down our health system and like your plan to put a massive new tax on business to make higher parental leave payments to those who already earn the most. It was a policy that broke Mr Abbott’s no new taxes policy just five weeks after he announced it.</para>
<para>Then there are your policies that are policies in name only, like your leader’s statement that Work Choices is dead, and the policies that you renege on under Mr Abbott’s leadership, like your commitment to put a price on carbon. So, as you sit there in your obstructionist, broken policy zone, think about this: the Rudd Labor government will be getting on with creating jobs and managing the economy, reforming our health and education systems, and making Australia a better and fairer place for all Australians.</para>

This personality started with ‘2020 Kevin’—that earnest man sitting on the carpet, cross-legged with his clipboard and taking down notes. He was taking notes, he was listening to Australia, he had a thousand people around for tea and he was going to make them all feel satisfied. What did we get out of that? What a revelation: we got the republic. I thought we had already heard that idea. Anyway, that is what we got from that. Then we had ‘Combat Kevin’. This man wants war. He had a war on obesity. He had a war on drugs. He had a war on inflation. He is a very violent man. He had a war on unemployment. He had a war on executive salaries. He was going to help the disadvantaged but he was going to have a war on homelessness. When he was not at war he was starting revolutions. He had a Building the Education Revolution. It was revolution and wars. It was him in his DPCUs with his Steyr under his arm. He was out there having wars.</para>
<para>Then we had ‘Earnest Kevin’, who was saying ‘sorry’ but not actually doing anything about Indigenous disadvantage. He was having review after review; he was having reviews on reviews. He was a man who lived in reviews, who lived as a dilettante wandering across the nation picking up daisies and thinking about the world. It was ‘Earnest Kevin’—</para>

<para>Then we had ‘Copenhagen Kevin’. He was going to cool the planet from a room in Canberra. He told us so. He was going to do it by himself. He did not need anybody else; he was flying solo on this one. He was really going to show us how big his muscles were! The unfortunate thing was that he was not only going to cool the planet; he was also going to try to cool everybody’s house. He was going to spend $2.45 billion cooling everybody’s house. But, far from cooling people’s houses, he actually ended up burning down in excess of 110 of them. Tragically, there were deaths associated with this. So much for ‘Copenhagen Kevin’.</para>
<para>Then we had ‘Casualty Kevin’. He was dressed up in a blue smock. He had a little plastic blue hat, a plastic blue jacket, and he had his little plastic pants and his plastic booties on. And it came with an association: he had Nicola in blue as well.</para>

<para>—‘Castro Prime Minister’—this one believes in nationalising the mining industry. This manifestation—in the ritual of new images being displayed for the Australian people—is peculiar in the extreme. Where was this promise at the last election? Australia has not heard something like this since 1949, when they were going to nationalise the banks. Don’t worry; it almost brought about a civil war, but let’s just put that behind us. Let’s forget about the new guard and all the things that occur when you nationalise industries. People are asking very serious questions about where we are now. What on earth has happened to this nation? It has devolved into something that is quite peculiar. You are getting all these manifestations, and it is costing you only $1¼ billion a week. What a bargain! What an absolute bargain! It must be a bargain to live at the philosophical brothel of ideas for only $1¼ billion a week—</para>

How could Australia honestly stay with this person for another three years? How could we possibly even venture down the path of living at this philosophical brothel for another three years? Look at the absolute hypocrite that Mr Rudd has made of Minister Wong. I honestly believe that what Minister Wong said was what she believed. But now, in his absolutely mercenary way, he has not only let down the Australian people; he is also destroying his colleagues, one after the other. He does not care who he shoots. He does not care what he does. It is beyond his capacity to have empathy and to actually understand what is happening.</para>

Don’t you dare change to Julia Gillard; you leave Mr Rudd right there, because he is turning into our biggest asset. We will watch tonight with wonderment as they put forward Wayne Swan to try to shade out Mr Rudd. Now we know that this is how far it has descended: Wayne Swan is going to save Kevin Rudd. That is where it has got to and that is what we will see tonight on television. It has really become total and utter pathos.</para>

<para>—Unfortunately, this debate has declined significantly. Some elements of humour do not cover the types of references that have been covered by opposition senators. Rather than argue their point—and I will come to what I think has been the main point in this debate—we get the sort of rhetoric that came from Senator Joyce about ‘brothels of ideas’ and ‘deflowerings’ and ‘being used’. We get all sorts of opinion as to the character of the Prime Minister from people who know very little about the man—in fact, from the same people who said very different things about John Howard when he was in government. I seem to recall reports about Senator Brandis’s references to John Howard as ‘the rat’, and yet he has the arrogance to come in here and say that our Prime Minister has no character and to claim that the very same Mr Howard is a man whom he holds in great regard.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In my short time today, I want to concentrate on what I think has been the main point—which Senator Brandis alluded to—and that is: this is about honouring promises. This is not about keeping promises regardless of changed circumstances; this is about having a plan, having an agenda and honouring the promises you have made. The best example I can give, just by virtue of my personal experience in this area and in the past, is what I would characterise as the national agenda for children. We refer to it as a national agenda for early childhood in Australia, but I recall when the minister of the day back in the early 2000s said that the Howard government would eventually introduce a national agenda for children. He claimed this for roughly five years. And we waited, and we waited, and we waited, and nothing happened.</para>
<para>Perhaps one of the most audacious claims of this opposition, when they mark their little tick boxes for what promises have been kept and what promises have not been kept, is when they talk about the 260 childcare centres that were part of our broader strategy of a national agenda for early childhood, because those centres were designed to rectify what the previous government had done to the market in child care. The promises that it made at that time were never kept. The promises of Barnaby Joyce’s former colleague Larry Anthony were never kept. The ministerial standards and the character that were meant to be part of the Howard government never occurred. That man left this parliament and went on to be a director of ABC child care and took fees from them during this process. I was only reminded a couple of weeks ago when he appeared in the Federal Court. We have seen the details of his consultant’s fees, his director’s fees and his lobbying on behalf of ABC child care, yet this opposition has the audacity to say that, because there are now changed circumstances in the market for long day care places, we have adjusted our policies in that area. We have, for some very good reasons which the government is able to justify and which are supported by the sector. Not only did we need to spend $58-odd million to rectify the problems around ABC child care—</para>

<para>—Opposition senators raise their arms at the reference to $58 million. Is it nothing, Senator? What the former government did in this sector was one of the most outrageous elements of the previous government. Today we have a much broader agenda that is being delivered and being implemented. We have promises such as: access to early childhood education for four-year-olds, which is being delivered, and national quality standards, which are being delivered. And, yes, we do have promises around accessibility to child care, which are being delivered.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In your usual trite way, you address the commitment in relation to childcare centres, but it is what you do not say that is critical. You do not say that the number of childcare centres has grown by 1,000 over the relevant period. So our earlier promises are less relevant today than they were when they were made. They were made at a time when the previous government was deliberately denying us market data so that this sector could not be planned competently. So we come into government, we deal with the collapse of ABC child care—which had been allowed to grow into an enormous monopoly of delivery—and we stabilise the sector. Then, after we have had access to the relevant information, we are able to assess what the real growth in the sector has been and we see that accessibility has been improved by changes in the market and that an extra thousand childcare centres have been delivered within the market. And only a fool would proceed with a policy once they understood what change had occurred.</para>
<para>Those opposite talk about integrity, quality and character, but I look back on just this one issue you claim is a broken promise and I remember what Prime Minister Howard allowed his minister to do in this sector. Let us look at some of that whilst I am on that point. Let us look at the fundraisers and the lobbying that was allowed to occur in ABC child care. That is the nature of the character of the former government—which you do not find in this government. You cannot find the casualties that occurred under the Howard government amongst our ministers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am delighted to speak on this subject this afternoon. One interesting thing I would say at the outset about this MPI is that it does seem to have been the inaugural outing of the Liberal Party’s new Senate leadership team. We have seen Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis put themselves through their paces in attempting, to use that worn old phrase, to develop a narrative for the Liberal Party.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I guess when one considers the subject of broken promises, one has to concede at the very outset that those opposite are very well credentialled indeed when it comes to broken promises. Let us look for a moment at Howard’s and, indeed, Abbott’s record with respect to broken promises, because for 11 years those opposite governed this country on the back of one broken promise following another. ‘There will never, ever be a GST’ was the pronouncement before the 2006 election, and of course we all know what became of that promise. ‘No worker will be worse off’ was the solid undertaking from those opposite when introducing Work Choices. That commitment is now a matter of record, a continuing stain on the honour of the coalition. John Howard declared in 2001:</para>

</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">Yet only a short time later, in June 2002, the Howard government cut the pensions of some 200,000 disability support pensioners.</para>
<para>In 2004 John Howard swore that he would keep interest rates at record lows. Mr Howard told an interviewer at the time: ‘There won’t be any pressure on interest rates from us.’ This, of course, was followed by five interest rate rises, which again stands as a lasting testament to the fact that those opposite cannot manage a boom and do not have the stomach to manage anything else.</para>
<para>We should not simply confine these broken promises to the former Prime Minister. Tony Abbott himself has star qualities in this debate. In October 2004 Tony Abbott himself gave ‘an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment’—those were his words—that the Medicare safety net threshold would not be raised. After the election the threshold was indeed raised. In an interview with Laurie Oaks, when questioned about this spectacular backflip, this spectacular piece of callisthenics, Tony Abbott admitted that the government had indeed been aware of significant budget blowouts in this particular item before the election. Laurie Oakes remarked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But your word’s not worth much any more, is it? A Tony Abbott commitment now will rouse horse laughs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was 2005, but the horse laughs continue, because those opposite today have the stomach, have the gall, have the cheek, to come into this place and try and accuse the Rudd Labor government of being behind ‘a litany of broken promises’. Let us take a moment to look at the profound deceit that sits behind and underpins that proposition. Since the Rudd Labor government came to office those opposite have worked assiduously as saboteurs in this place to block the government’s program. They have left no stone unturned in their resolve to obstruct and stymie the democratic mandate, a mandate secured by Kevin Rudd and Labor in 2007.</para>
<para>I have procured a list of all of the various pieces of legislation that those opposite have successfully blocked in this place and I seek to mention only some of the highlights for the edification of those opposite: the luxury car tax imposition, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill, the business investment partnership bill, the climate change bill version 1, the Household Stimulus Package Bill 2009, the Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill 2008, and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill. It is a short taste of a much longer list which stands as testament to the fact that you have left absolutely no stone unturned in your commitment to blocking the program of this government. For you this might indeed be a list of pride, because you have successfully sabotaged and dismantled, at every available opportunity, the program of this government. Having succeeded in that heinous task all too often, you now have the cheek to come into this place and try and complain about the fact that some of this government’s commitments have not been achieved—the fruit of your own obstructionism. It is an absolute outrage.</para>
<para>Of course, the greatest of those outrages, at least to my mind, is in relation to climate change. While those opposite seek to crow about the fact that climate change legislation has been successfully defeated in this parliament, they do not seem to take the bow for succeeding in achieving that. That bill was brought to this parliament and it was successfully blocked by the coalition and the Greens. Undeterred, the government continued with its resolve to create action on climate change. Penny Wong and Greg Combet, undeterred, entered into negotiations with the Liberal Party. As we know, when it comes to breaking promises those opposite have absolutely superb credentials. So it is no surprise to us that, having reached an agreement with the opposition about the passage of that climate change legislation, the catherine-wheel of the Liberal Party’s climate change policy finally came to rest over the corpse of Malcolm Turnbull. Having finally reached a resolve to be climate change deniers—after 10 or 11 permutations—you blocked that legislation for a second time.</para>
<para>Let us consider the enormity of that deed, because not only were you reneging on an agreement you reached with the government, not only did you tear down your own leader to achieve it, but you did it in the face of your own commitments to the Australian people and in the face of your own policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3:</inline> The committee recommends that the Government exempts the Remote Locality Leave Travel entitlement from fringe benefits reporting.</para>
<para class="block">The Government does not agree with this proposal.</para>
<para class="block">The fringe benefits tax (FBT) system plays an important role in maintaining the fairness and integrity of Australia’s taxation system. It places employees with access to fringe benefits on a more even footing with employees whose remuneration consists entirely of salary or wages.</para>
<para class="block">The introduction of FBT was designed to remove a serious gap in the income tax law and ensure that all forms of remuneration paid to employees bear a fair measure of tax. The FBT system also facilitates the inclusion of fringe benefits in an employee’s income for the purposes of means testing benefits such as family tax benefit. This ensures that families with remuneration consisting entirely of salary are treated equally, when compared to those in receipt of fringe benefits.</para>
<para class="block">FBT applies to virtually all employers, including Government, and is designed to be as inclusive as possible in the coverage of benefits received by employees in respect of employment are taxed, whether received in cash or otherwise.</para>
<para class="block">Providing a FBT reporting exemption for the remote locality leave travel entitlement to members of the ADF would be inequitable to other employees working in remote locations who receive similar benefits (for example, employees working in the mining industry) and have them recorded on their payment summary. This exclusion would also have a broad range of implication across the transfer system.</para>
<para class="block">Many of the existing FBT exemptions are work-related, that is, there is a general underlying principle that concessions or exemptions are provided on the basis that if these expenses were borne by the employee, it would be deductible to them. The Remote Locality Leave Travel Entitlement would not be deductible under the income tax law as there would not be the relevant nexus between the expense incurred and their employment. The expense, had the employee borne it themselves, would be considered private in nature.</para>
<para class="block">The Australia’s Future Tax System Review, established by the Rudd Government in 2008 to review our tax and transfer system, delivered its final report to the Government at the end of 2009. Within the scope of the review was the taxation treatment of fringe benefits. The Government is currently considering the review’s recommendations and will release the report, and its initial response in early 2010.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Government Response to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report on Australia’s involvement in peacekeeping operations.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that, before the Australian Government commits personnel to a peacekeeping operation, it is satisfied that the mandate has:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>clearly stated and achievable goals based on an assessment and understanding of risks, including the worst case scenario;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>a level of commitment that can be sustained throughout the life of the mission in order to achieve the stated objectives; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>adequate resources to meet the objectives—the proposed force to have the capacity and capability to fulfil its tasks as set out in the mandate, and sufficient financial resources available to implement the mandate.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">Furthermore, where Australia is taking a key or lead role in the proposed mission, the committee recommends that the Government of Australia ensure the terms of the mandate strictly meet these fundamental requirements. This would be done in consultation with the host country, the UN and potential partners.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. The Government is committed to promoting well informed, clear mandates, as well as achievable goals and a commitment to adequate funding as a fundamental enabler of mission success. This is demonstrated by our engagement with the United Nations (UN) Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) on the development of peacekeeping doctrine.</para>
<para class="block">The Government notes that in some circumstances it may be necessary to allow Australia to commit personnel prior to the full articulation of these mission aspects where our strong national interests are engaged. Flexibility is also required to enable ongoing review of a mission’s mandate and goals in response to developments over time, as has occurred with the UN and African Union’s efforts in Sudan.</para>
<para class="block">Where Australia is considering or has taken a leading role in a mission, the ability to sustain an appropriate level of materiel, human resourcing and financial support over the life of the mission is a priority consideration for Government. This is evidenced through Australia’s ongoing support to missions including in Solomon Islands and East Timor.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to support actively the R2P doctrine and, through its representations in the UN, ensure that international deliberations are informed by the doctrine.</para>
<para class="block">The committee also recommends that in the committee’s proposed white paper on peacekeeping (Recommendation 37). the Australian Government include a discussion on, and an explanation of, Australia’s current position on this evolving doctrine.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. The Government is committed to advancing the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principle, and Australia is an active supporter of R2P within the UN and its own region. The Government is providing an overall package of $4.58 million to advance a number of R2P initiatives including a $1.86 million joint initiative with the Asia Pacific Centre for R2P at the University of Queensland; a $2 million Australian R2P Fund that will disburse grants to support R2P outreach and research projects in the Asia Pacific region; and $300,000 to the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect and S417, 000 to the Non Government</para>
<para class="block">Organisation (NGO) Coalition for R2P, both of which are based in New York. This package of Australian support will materially contribute to the advancement of R2P at the local, regional and global levels and across a range of political and civil society settings.</para>
<para class="block">Government does not agree there would be benefit in a white paper on peacekeeping as noted in response to recommendation 37. See further response to recommendation 37.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that before the Australian Government decides to contribute to a non-UN mandated peacekeeping operation, it is satisfied that the mission has a proper legal framework with recognised authority to deploy the operation and is consistent with Australian law. In this regard the committee recommends that:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>as early as practicable, the UN is consulted and fully informed about developments and any proposals for a peacekeeping operation;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>the Australian Government places the highest priority on securing regional support for the peacekeeping operation;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>the host country, through its legally recognised authorities, has requested the establishment of a peacekeeping operation and willingly consented to the deployment of forces and the conditions under which they are to operate - the agreement to be documented in appropriate legal instruments and provided to the Security Council; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>the legal documents authorising the deployment of a peacekeeping operation to be treated, if not in the form of a treaty, in a way similar to treaties; that is, tabled in Parliament with an accompanying National Interest Analysis and examined by a parliamentary committee.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">Furthermore, that the operation’s mandate:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>is in complete accord with the UN Charter and is accountable to universally accepted human rights standards and Australian law;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>contains arrangements to ensure that the Security Council and the peacekeeping operation complement each other’s efforts to keep the peace; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>includes provisions making the mission accountable to the UN and covers issues such as reporting procedures and channels for the exchange of information.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">Finally, through both formal and informal channels, the government endeavours to obtain UN endorsement of the operation even though the operation may have commenced.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. The Government will continue to ensure that, before contributing to non-UN mandated peacekeeping operations, the operations’ mandate is in accord with the UN Charter (including any relevant Security Council resolutions), applicable human rights standards and Australian law. The Government must satisfy itself that the conditions under which forces are to operate are documented in appropriate instruments. While in some circumstances a treaty- level instrument may be required, in other circumstances lower level instruments may be sufficient. Consistent with long-established Government policy, such lower level instruments are not tabled in Parliament.</para>
<para class="block">The Government would only contribute to a non-UN mandated peacekeeping operation if satisfied that the host country, through its legally recognised authorities, requested the establishment of a peacekeeping operation and willingly consented to the deployment of forces.</para>
<para class="block">The Government notes that in certain circumstances where a host country seeks a peace-keeping operation due to a humanitarian emergency (e.g., East Timor in 2006 and 2008 and Tonga in 2006), an instrument of less-than treaty status may be the only mechanism allowing relevant countries to consent to that operation in a timely manner. Such an instrument would be confidential to the participants and therefore the Government would not be in a position to table the instrument in Parliament for examination by a parliamentary committee. The Government considers it necessary only to table in Parliament those instruments that create binding international legal obligations on Australia.</para>
<para class="block">Government further notes that Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations does not require Member States participating in a regional peacekeeping operation to provide a copy of the relevant instrument to the Security Council. If requested by the UNSC, the Government would use its best endeavours to seek the agreement of the other participants before providing copies of the relevant instrument to the Security Council. Likewise, if the UN requests the Government provide further information or report periodically on the progress of Australian contributions to a regional peace-keeping operation, the Australian Government would seek to cooperate fully with the UN.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">In light of the concerns raised about the conditions under which some members of ATST -EM were deployed, the committee recommends that the ADF conduct a review of this deployment to identify any shortcomings and ensure that lessons from ATST-EM’s experiences inform the deployment of similar small contingents. This case study would, for example, examine matters such as their preparation to serve as unarmed peacekeepers, the chain of command</para>
<para class="block">arrangements and the provision of health services.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The Government is already in compliance with this recommendation. Headquarters Joint Operations Command (HQJOC) staff is reviewing the Australian Training Support Team East Timor (ATST-EM) deployment to ensure that relevant lessons have been captured and incorporated into planning processes where appropriate.</para>
<para class="block">Beyond the specific case of the ATST-EM, the ADF has an ongoing ‘lessons learned’ process which integrates lessons through small evaluation teams focussed on designated objectives. These teams capture data and information, during the actual conduct of each operation as well as reporting from commanders, senior staff and participants. The information is recorded in the ADF Activities Analysis Database System.</para>
<para class="block">In addition to the ‘lessons learned’ process, HQJOC has implemented an Operational Capability Review (OCR) process to review the tasks and composition of all deployed elements. The OCR process will enable information and issues from theatre to be captured and conveyed to HQJOC directly, allowing timely action such as force design and training adjustments for follow-on rotations, and the application of lessons to other relevant situations. The OCR process is being rolled out progressively with priority to larger and more complex contingents, but will in time be applied to every ongoing ADF deployment.</para>
<para class="block">With regard to medical support for our deployed personnel in East Timor, Defence establishes and maintains medical facilities to support ADF personnel in Australian-commanded missions. Health facilities supporting ADF personnel in East Timor have matured since the first Australian deployment in 1999. For Timor, UN health facilities are currently augmented by the contracted ADF facility for more serious medical conditions/cases.</para>
<para class="block">UN-assigned personnel routinely receive first line medical support through organic UN health facilities. Where ADF local support is not available to provide a back-up facility, ADF personnel within UN contingents receive agreed health support through the local UN health facilities (if available). ADF personnel also receive Combat First Aid training and are issued with a deployable medical kit. Additionally, there are agreed higher levels of care available regionally where ADF personnel can be evacuated for treatment if required.</para>
<para class="block">Government is committed to ensuring that the very best health support is available</para>
<para class="block">ADF personnel. As noted in the response to Recommendation 27, Defence has commissioned the Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health to conduct the Deployment Health Surveillance Program, a series of longitudinal health studies of deployed personnel, including mental health issues.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that, before deploying Australian personnel to a peacekeeping operation, the Australian Government ensure that all instruments covering the use of force are unambiguous, clearly understood, appropriate to the mission and provide adequate protection.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. Prior to approving deployment of Australian personnel to a peacekeeping operation, the Government determines whether the legal basis allows for sufficient force protection in light of the assigned mission and after considering all the prevailing circumstances of</para>
<para class="block">the proposed peacekeeping operation.</para>
<para class="block">The Government notes that the legal basis for use of force contained in the authorising UN mandate for a particular peacekeeping operation cannot be unilaterally amended by the Government to ensure that it is ‘appropriate to the mission and provide[s] adequate protection.’ Instead, the mission’s rules of engagement (ROE) must be appropriately defined and suitably tailored to complement the legal basis for use of force. If the legal basis for the mission is deemed to be inadequate, then the Government may either decline to contribute to the peacekeeping operation or seek changes to the mandate that would satisfy its concerns.</para>
<para class="block">The Government further notes that while deployed, all ADF commanders and AFP personnel have an obligation to continually review the authorised ROE or Use of Force, and to seek clarification or request any necessary changes if they are considered to be unclear or inadequate to cover the security situation. The Government understands the importance of having an appropriate and unambiguous use of force regime that is fully understood by all personnel involved, whether the mission is a UN or non-UN peacekeeping operation.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that all government agencies advising the Australian Government on Australia’s participation in a proposed peacekeeping operation address clearly the adequacy of force protection provided in the mandate and accompanying ROE. This consideration is not only from the perspective of the physical safety of Australian personnel but also their mental wellbeing. Ultimately, the government must be satisfied that the mandate matches the needs on the ground.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. A primary consideration when advising Government on a decision to commit personnel to a peacekeeping operation is the adequacy of available force protection measures for the overall wellbeing of Australian personnel.</para>
<para class="block">The Government is committed to ensuring that high quality mental health support is available for Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel and the ex-service community. As discussed in the Government response to Recommendation 23, Government has developed a Mental Health Lifecycle Initiatives Package. The Package includes nine strategic mental health initiatives targeted across the four stages of an ADF member’s lifecycle: recruitment, service, transition, and resettlement into civilian life. As part of these initiatives, the Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health (ACPMH) is undertaking research and learning processes to enhance current practices. Defence and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs are working closely with the ACPMH on the lifecycle initiative.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, Defence has commissioned the Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health to conduct the Deployment Health Surveillance Program, a series of longitudinal health studies of deployed personnel, including mental health issues.</para>
<para class="block">The Government notes that, in the case of a UN-mandated peacekeeping operation, force protection policy and military ROE applicable to Australian personnel are ultimately derived from the UN mandate, which as previously noted cannot be unilaterally amended.</para>
<para class="block">Prior to approving Australian participation in a peacekeeping mission, the Government receives advice on the sufficiency of ROE and force protection measures in view of the needs on the ground. This process applies to all ADF operations including those not led by the UN, and non- peacekeeping operations.</para>
<para class="block">As noted in the response to Recommendation 5, all ADF commanders deployed on peacekeeping operations have an obligation to continually review the authorised ROE, and to seek clarification or request any necessary changes if they are considered to be unclear or inadequate to cover the military situation.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that, when considering a proposed peacekeeping operation, the Australian Government examine in detail the mission’s exit strategy to ensure that Australia’s contribution is part of a well-planned and structured approach to achieving clearly stated objectives. When committing forces to an operation the Australian Government should clearly articulate its exit strategy.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. The Government recognises the importance of exit strategies. However, as noted in response to Recommendation 1, a degree of flexibility is required, as there may be circumstances where it is not appropriate to articulate an exit strategy.</para>
<para class="block">The Government conducts a classified annual review of the ADF’s commitments to peacekeeping operations. This review critically examines each mission and considers the continuance, or otherwise, of the ADF’s contribution.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the ADF place a high priority on its undertaking to give training for peacekeeping operations a ‘more prominent place’ in its training regime. This training should extend to reservists as well as regular members of the ADF.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. Training for peacekeeping operations has been identified as a fundamental element to the continuum of training in the ADF, especially within the Army. Land Command provides collective training for regular and reservist personnel aimed at meeting operational requirements, and peacekeeping is included as part of this requirement for operational training. In addition, the ADF Peace Operations Training Centre (formerly the ADF Warfare Centre (ADFWC)) includes peacekeeping operations modules on most of its joint courses and incorporates peacekeeping and stabilisation operations in joint exercises, such as the Talisman Sabre series with the United States. Peacekeeping operations are covered in a dedicated civil- military cooperation course, and also in a variety of other courses conducted by the ADFWC through presentations, syndicate tutorials and discussion periods.</para>
<para class="block">The ADF Peacekeeping Centre also provides the ADF UN Military Observers’ Course, which prepares selected military personnel from Australia and overseas for service as military observers in UN or multinational peacekeeping operations. The course is focused on meeting the standards stipulated by UN DPKO’s Integrated Training System. Since 2008, components of the course have been merged into a course conducted by the AFP’s International Deployment Group.</para>
<para class="block">Previously, the ADFWC ran the International Peace Operations Seminar (IPOS). The Asia Pacific Civil-Military Centre of Excellence (APCM COE), created in 2008, now has responsibility for conducting 1POS, and has split the seminar into two courses focused on enhancing whole-of-government and whole-of-nation capabilities, and promoting civil-military UN and international engagement in the Asia Pacific region. These are the Civil-Military Interaction Seminar and the Civil-Military Interaction Workshop, the latter which is developed and delivered with the Asia Pacific Centre for Military Law (APCML). APCMCOE is also working closely with the ADF and relevant Government agencies to identify core training activities as part of a Training Continuum for military, police and civilian personnel.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the AFP adhere to a procurement policy that requires, where possible, any equipment purchased for use in a peacekeeping operation to be compatible with equipment or technology used by the ADF.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The need for the ADF and AFP to operate together closely has been recognised by both Agencies and is pursued vigorously under an interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on interoperability, signed in 2008 by the Secretary of the Department of Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Commissioner of the AFP.</para>
<para class="block">AFP and ADF logistics and capability development staff meet on a regular basis to discuss procurement opportunities as appropriate, and both Defence and the AFP recognise the unique operational responsibilities that each organisation needs to meet. Where practicable, common procurement solutions will be pursued; however, where operational responsibilities diverge and unique solutions are required, the most efficient and effective procurement solutions will prevail. Future developments on ADF and AFP Interoperability are under the direction of the Joint Steering Committee on Defence and AFP Interoperability.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the ADF and the AFP work together to devise and implement programs—joint training and exercises—and develop shared doctrine that will improve their interoperability when deployed overseas. In particular, the committee recommends that the ADF implement a program of secondments of their members to the AFP’s International Deployment Group.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. As noted in response to recommendation 9, in 2008 Defence and the AFP signed an MOU on interoperability, which provides a framework for cooperation in the preparation for and conduct of operations. A Joint Steering Committee on interoperability, headed by the National Manager of the AFP’s International Deployment Group and the ADF’s Chief of Joint Operations, has been established in accordance with the MOU. The MOU notes that interoperability is the ability to train, exercise and operate effectively together in the execution of assigned missions and tasks. Participation by the AFP on Exercise Talisman Sabre 2009 is a contemporary example of exercising together.</para>
<para class="block">Should Defence and AFP be deployed to the same area of operations, coordination mechanisms are developed to achieve mutually supporting outcomes. As interoperability between organisations matures, this may lead to the inclusion of police as part of the Australian joint operations architecture. The APCM COE has secondees from Defence, the AFP and civilian agencies, and provides a further opportunity to develop and participate in joint training and education programs, and develop doctrine for practical collaboration.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 11</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that DFAT and AusAID jointly review the pre-deployment training arrangements for Commonwealth officers being deployed on peacekeeping missions with a view to establishing a government approved course of training. The committee recommends further that:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>all Commonwealth personnel deploying to a peacekeeping operation satisfy the requirements of this course;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>relevant government agencies require all their external contractors providing services to a peacekeeping operation to undergo appropriate screening and training; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>to ensure the effective transfer of skills and knowledge, DFAT and AusAID include in their pre-deployment preparations a ‘training for trainers’ course for personnel whose duties involve instructing or coaching people in a host country.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially Agreed</inline>. The Government agrees that AusAID and the APCM COE should review the pre-deployment training arrangements for Commonwealth officers being deployed on peacekeeping missions, and this process is already underway.</para>
<para class="block">The Government agrees that all Commonwealth personnel deploying on peacekeeping operations should satisfy pre-deployment training requirements. There is scope for training modules to be further developed and refined, to address core skill sets for peacekeeping operations. However, given the wide range of peacekeeping situations and varying roles of agencies, training programs must also be tailored to different contexts and roles.</para>
<para class="block">The Government agrees that -train the trainer’ or capacity building skills are important for personnel whose duties involve instructing or coaching people in a host country. AusAID currently provides such training when required as a part of its pre-deployment programs for Commonwealth officers deployed under the aid program.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 12</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that DFAT undertake a comparative review and analysis of the strategic level arrangements for the planning and coordination of RAMSI and peacekeeping operations in Timor-Leste and to use the findings as a guide for future missions.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The Government agrees with the intent of this recommendation. The APCM COE commissioned the Australian Strategic Policy Institute to conduct a study into the key civil- military lessons from Australia’s response to recent disaster and conflict events in the region, including support to the Regional Assistance Mission Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and Timor Leste. The study focused on civil-military lessons in relation to whole-of-government policy and planning and operational implementation. The findings of the study. together with supplementary research and lessons learned activities, will help to support Australia’s approach to strategic-level planning and coordination for future missions.</para>
<para class="block">Mission planning will also be informed by the development of a civil-military conceptual framework for conflict and disaster management. This framework, being developed by the APCM COE in collaboration with relevant government departments and agencies, is drawing from both Australian and international experiences in planning for peace and stabilisation operations.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 13</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that AusAID coordinate a consultation with DFAT, Defence, AFP, ACFID and key NGOs to establish a more effective mechanism for involving the NGO sector in the planning of Australia’s involvement in peacekeeping operations.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to broader engagement with the NGO sector through the AusAID-ACFID Partnership Agreement. The Agreement contains an undertaking on the part of AusAID to facilitate an enhanced relationship between the NGO sector and other federal agencies.</para>
<para class="block">The Government, through AusAID and the APCM COE, will collaborate to host a forum with the Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) and relevant NGOs and international organisations in 2010. It is expected that this forum will provide a further opportunity for dialogue and the exchange of ideas on peacekeeping issues and best practice for peacekeeping operations. This will build upon an earlier collaborative activity organised by the Government to ensure Australian and international NGO involvement in the development of civil-military doctrine for UN DPKO.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, a responsibility of the APCM COE is to engage and develop collaborative mechanisms to support civil-military best practice with the non-government sector, which has been enhanced by the creation of an NGO Adviser position at the APCM COE. The position facilitates dialogue and an enhanced understanding between the NGO sector and government agencies on civil-military planning and capabilities for conflict and disaster management. The position, funded by AusAID, was filled by ACFID in September 2009.</para>
<para class="block">It is important to note that while opportunities to involve the NGO sector in the planning for Australian peacekeeping operations is considered desirable by the Government, the extent to which this can occur needs to be balanced by relevant security considerations.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 14</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that a whole-of-government working group, such as the Peace Operations Working Group, arrange to hold regular meetings with representatives of NGOs engaged in peacekeeping operations to discuss and develop training programs and courses that would improve their working relationship. The committee recommends further that, in consultation with other government agencies and relevant NGOs, DFAT and AusAID review this arrangement in 2010 to assess the value to each organisation involved, and how it could be improved. The results of the review would be noted in DFAT’s annual report.</para>

The Government agrees there is a need for regular dialogue between relevant government agencies and NGOs to enhance cooperation between the government and non- government sector, including through appropriate training activities. The mechanism for dialogue raised in response to Recommendation 13 provides an opportunity to consider training and education needs. Also, as raised in response to Recommendation 13, the NGO Adviser position at the APCM COE is strengthening Government-NGO engagement, and facilitating input from the NGO community into civil-military training and education programs organised by the APCM COE.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. Defence is already in compliance with this recommendation. The ADFWC completed a review of its Civil Military Co-operation (CIMIC) doctrine in April 2009. A wide range of civilian and military agencies were consulted in the formulation of this review, including NGOs. The doctrine has also been designed to facilitate interoperability with our major allies and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</para>
<para class="block">Defence has also provided key support to the UN DPKO in developing CIMIC doctrine for modern, complex UN peacekeeping missions.</para>
<para class="block">In the 2009 Defence White Paper, the Government recognised that:</para>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The APCM COE will facilitate dialogue and practical measures to strengthen the pre- deployment preparation of military and civilian personnel for peacekeeping operations. In 2008, the APCM COE commissioned an audit of current civil-military training courses available in Australia and internationally. The findings of this audit are informing the Centre’s training and education strategy and its implementation.</para>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. As noted in the response to Recommendation 12, the APCM COE commissioned a study of Australia’s responses to recent conflict and disaster events in the region to identify civil-military lessons. This study was undertaken by ASPI and involved interviews with personnel from the Department of Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet, DFAT, Defence, Attorney-General’s Department, AusAID.

</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the Australian Government commission independent research to test, against the experiences of past deployments, the relevance of the factors identified by the committee that should inform Australia’s approach to, and planning for, a regional operation. These include the need for understanding sensitivities regarding sovereignty, language skills and cultural awareness, local ownership and involving local community groups (for complete list see paragraph 16.61). The committee further recommends that the information be used to develop a template for the conduct of future missions.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially Agreed</inline>. The Government is committed to continuous improvements in both civilian and military training, and recognises that reviews of lessons learned from a whole-of--government perspective can help our planning, policy and practice in-country. Existing exercises and training by the AFP, ADF and AusAID have improved the focus on cultural awareness, language skills and related issues. AusAID and other government agencies are examining mechanisms to improve civilian deployment, while recognising that every mission involving the deployment of civilians will be different.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 22</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that a whole-of-government working group review the language and cultural awareness training of government agencies with a view to developing a more integrated and standardised system of training for Australian peacekeepers.

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. As noted in the response to recommendation 21, while recognising that every mission will be different, the Government is committed to continuous improvements in both civilian and military training. AusAID and other government agencies continue to examine mechanisms to improve civilian deployments while existing exercises and training by the AFP, ADF and AusAID have enhanced their focus on cultural awareness, language skills and related issues.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 23</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that exchange programs and joint exercises with personnel from countries relevant to peacekeeping operations in the region continue as a high priority. It also suggests that such activities form part of a broader coherent whole-of-government strategy to build a greater peacekeeping capacity in the region.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The Government acknowledges the value of continuing exchange programs and joint exercises with personnel from countries relevant to peacekeeping operations in the region.</para>
<para class="block">The Government notes a requirement to balance exchange programs and joint exercises with Australian policy priorities, and with consideration for the particular circumstances of a given agency. Individual agencies need the flexibility to pursue engagement priorities informed by wider national interests and Government guidance. For example, the AFP delivers education and training programs for the Pacific Island Countries contribution to the Participating Police Force in RAMSI; this has been extended to include observer/trainers from the East Timor Police Force. The AFP is the only regional police force with a training institution dedicated to preparing its officers for duty in peace and stability operations. Accordingly, the AFP is focused on education and training rather than exchanges. The AFP expects to conduct broader engagement with regional nations from South East Asia in the future.</para>
<para class="block">The Government will also continue to support the work of UN agencies and regional organisations, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, in capacity building efforts for partner countries involved in peace operations. The civil-military training programs being developed and facilitated by the APCM COE, as noted in the response to Recommendation 8, include participants from the Asia Pacific region.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 24</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that greater impetus be given to the implementation of UN Resolution 1325. It recommends that the Peace Operations Working Group be the driving force behind ensuring that all agencies are taking concrete actions to encourage greater involvement of women in peacekeeping operations.</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends further that DFAT provide in its annual report an account of the whole-of-government performance in implementing this resolution. The report should go beyond merely listing activities to provide indicators of the effectiveness of Australia’s efforts to implement Resolution 1325.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. The Government notes that Resolution 1325 covers issues broader than peacekeeping, making full application and implementation of the resolution broader than the working group’s mandate. In 2008 the Australian Government Office for Women funded an Australian non-government organisation to undertake research into possible options for the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (Resolution 1325) including the possible development of a National Action Plan (NAP). Detailed research and community consultation was undertaken, culminating in a report to the Office for Women in July 2009 for consideration by government. In October 2009 an inter-departmental working group was convened to consider next steps. The Minister for the Status of Women then wrote to the Prime Minister and relevant ministerial colleagues seeking their support for the development of an Australian national action plan.</para>
<para class="block">The Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Defence, Minister for Home Affairs, the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance have given their support for a whole of government approach to the development of an Australian national action plan.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 25</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that Australian government agencies actively pursue opportunities to second senior officers to the United Nations. Furthermore, that such secondments form part of a broader departmental and whole-of-government strategy designed to make better use of the knowledge and experience gained by seconded officers. In other words, appointments should not be terminal postings and should be perceived as important and valuable career opportunities.</para>
<para class="block">

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The Government actively pursues opportunities to deploy senior officers to UN missions and UN Headquarters in New York.

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 26</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the ADF develop a comprehensive and reliable database on Australian peacekeepers that would provide accurate statistics on where and when ADF members were deployed.

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. PMKeyS, the ADF corporate human resource management system, provides a comprehensive and reliable database from which statistics can be extracted to identify dates and locations of service by Australian Peacekeepers.</para>
<para class="block">The PMKeyS OpsLog is completed prior to a service member’s departure on any operational service, and then maintained to accurately represent service within an Area of Operations. OpsLog data enables periods of overseas service to he correlated against reported health problems, by operation, time and location. Considerable work has been undertaken since the introduction of OpsLog in July 2005 to incorporate information from other data sources. Project Remediate, the latest of such initiatives, is intended to capture data on ADF operational deployments of all types prior to July 2005.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 27</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the ADF broaden the scope of the research and studies being done on veterans’ mental health by the Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health and the Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health to include the rehabilitation of veterans with mental health problems; the retraining opportunities or career transition services provided to them; the quality of, and access to, appropriate and continuing care; and the stigma attached to mental health problems in the ADF.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. These issues are being addressed in the Government Mental Health Lifecycle Initiatives Package. The Package includes nine strategic mental health initiatives targeted across the four stages of an ADF member’s lifecycle: recruitment, service, transition, and resettlement into civilian life. As part of these initiatives, the Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health (ACPMH) is undertaking research and learning processes to</para>
<para class="block">enhance current practices. Defence and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) are working closely with the ACPMH on the lifecycle initiative.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, Defence has commissioned the Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health to conduct the Deployment Health Surveillance Program, a series of longitudinal health studies of deployed personnel, including mental health issues. Studies have been completed on the Solomon Islands, Timor Leste and Bougainville, and a study of the Middle East Area of Operations will follow.</para>
<para class="block">As part of the Review of Mental Health in Defence, Professor David Dunt has examined the scope of mental health research in the ADF, addressing the issue of the stigma attached to mental health problems. The review included a variety of submissions taken from many interested parties including individuals, ex-service organisations and other Government Departments. The report, and Government response, was released by the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the Hon Warren Snowdon and the Minister for Veterans” Affairs, the Hon Alan Griffin on 1 May 2009. The Government has accepted, either wholly or in principle, all recommendations in the report.</para>
<para class="block">In addition, Professor Dunt also undertook an Independent Study into Suicide in the Ex-Service Community, with the report released by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs on 4 May 2009.

<para class="block">The Review of Military Compensation Arrangements is examining the current military rehabilitation and compensation system, including whether the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA) should cover the AFP members deployed on high risk overseas missions. A Steering Committee has been established to manage the Review. The Committee is comprised of senior Government representatives and a member of the community with compensation expertise, and is chaired by the Chair of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission.</para>
<para class="block">Interim arrangements have been put in place for AFP officers serving in high risk missions to align rehabilitation and compensation arrangements with Defence, pending the outcomes of this review.

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 29</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the ADF commission an independent audit of its medical records to determine the accuracy and completeness of the records, and to identify any deficiencies with a view to implementing changes to ensure that all medical records are up-to- date and complete. The audit report should be provided, through the Minister for Defence, to the committee.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Not agreed</inline>. While initiatives are underway to meet the intent of the recommendation, the Government notes that an audit, as proposed by the committee, would not meet the requirement to -determine the accuracy and completeness of records” because effective datum for benchmarking accuracy and completeness does not exist.</para>
<para class="block">The Government further notes that Defence is developing an electronic medical record system based on a commercial product, enabling individual records to be developed and maintained electronically. Using the Rapid Prototype Development and Evaluation (RPDE) process, Defence has commenced a requirements collection task. RPDE will then consider commercial off-the-shelf options, then trial and evaluate potential solutions before making a decision on the way ahead. This new e-health system will ensure all health information is collected and is available to all health providers for the care of the individual, and for Joint Health Command to use to manage the health of the ADF.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 30</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the Australian Government requests ANAO to audit the hardware and software used by the ADF and DVA in their health records management system to identify measures needed to ensure that into the future the system is able to provide the type of detailed information of the like required by the committee but apparently not accessible.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially Agreed</inline>. Following an ANAO audit in 2001, a number of health initiatives were identified aimed at retiring legacy systems and delivering a new health information systems environment to Joint Health Command, including the development of an e-health system as recommended by the ANAO and as detailed in the response to Recommendation 29. When completed, this system will enable the detailed information requirements mentioned by the Committee to be addressed.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 31</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee also recommends that Defence commission the Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health to assess the hardware and software used by Defence and DVA for managing the health records of ADF personnel and, in light of the committee’s concerns, make recommendations on how the system could be improved.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. In light of the initiatives underway to retire legacy systems and deliver a new health information systems environment to Joint Health Command, there would be limited value in the Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health (CMVH) assessing the hardware and software currently used by Defence in managing health records. There may be value in the CMVH assessing the new hardware and software at a future date.</para>
<para class="block">Government also notes that the CMVH has made considerable contribution to informing the e-health debate within Defence and DVA, and continues to do so through the quarterly meeting of the CMVH E-Health Strategic Research Working Group.</para>
<para class="block">

<para class="block">The committee recommends that the Australian Government consider additional funding for the proposed Peacekeeping Memorial.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project Committee (APMPC) is keeping the Minister, through DVA, informed about the progress of its fundraising activities. Any additional funding, beyond the $200,000 paid to the APMPC in June 2006, would be considered by the Minister. However, consistent with the rules governing all other memorials, public donations form a key indicator of public support for the establishment of a national memorial.</para>
<para class="block">The Government notes that it is usual practice for the construction of new national memorials to be managed by committees of ex-service organisations and other community groups which have demonstrated the ability to raise the necessary funds and the skills necessary to manage such a project to completion.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 33</inline>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in-Principle</inline>. The Government recognises the public prominence of Australia’s involvement in East Timor, which was Australia’s largest peacekeeping operation and was the first time Australia had led a major international coalition force. The Official Historian, Professor David Horner, has begun consultation with relevant departments to discuss this matter.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Request to Auditor General</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee requests that the Auditor-General consider conducting a performance audit on the mechanisms that the ADF has in place for capturing lessons from current and recent peacekeeping operations including: the adequacy of its performance indicators; whether lessons to be learnt from its evaluation processes are documented and inform the development or refinement of ADF’s doctrine and practices; and how these lessons are shared with other relevant agencies engaged in peacekeeping operations and incorporated into the whole-of--government decision-making process.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed</inline>. The Auditor General will consider the merits of undertaking such a performance audit in the development of its 2009-10 Audit Work Program, taking into account other audit priorities.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 34</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the relevant government agencies jointly develop standard measurable performance indicators that, where applicable, would be used across all agencies when evaluating the effectiveness of their peacekeeping activities (also see Recommendation 36).</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially Agreed</inline>. The Government notes that agencies already monitor and evaluate peacekeeping missions, particularly where agencies are represented together in the field. The AFP has contracted the University of Queensland to research measures of performance for police contributions to peace and stability operations and capacity building missions. Initial discussions between AFP and DSTO specialists have determined that some of the measures could be jointly applicable to both policing and the ADF in the peace and stability operations environment, and they will attempt to test this joint applicability in an exercise environment.</para>
<para class="block">Government agencies, however, hold differing areas of expertise and mission focus, necessitating divergent approaches towards meeting their particular mission goals and requirements. In conjunction with the diverse scope of requirements across peacekeeping missions, this makes it problematic to standardise performance indicators across multiple peacekeeping operations and contributing departments.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 35</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the Australian Government designate an appropriate agency to take responsibility for the whole-of-government reporting on Australia’s contribution to peacekeeping. This means that the agency’s annual report would include a description of all peacekeeping operations, a list of the contributing government agencies, and, for each relevant agency:</para>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. Government is considering if and how best to take forward Recommendation 35. An annual report may not be the best publication in which to collate and publicise Australia’s contribution to peacekeeping operations. Government agencies currently report relevant information on peacekeeping operations within their respective annual reports. As noted in response to recommendation 7, Defence also coordinates a classified annual review</para>

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Partially agreed</inline>. The Government acknowledges the importance of agencies providing clear and accurate reporting —against measurable performance indicators where appropriate —on the effectiveness of their activities.

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government welcomes the report of the Senate Standing Committee onn an important tool in addressing discrimination and changing attitudes about the participation of women and men in a range of areas of public life. The SDA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in employment, educational institutions, and in the provision of goods and services. The SDA, similar to other</para>
<para class="block">anti-discrimination laws, has been an important mechanism in changing community perceptions and setting appropriate standards to recognise that men and women should be able to fully participate in the social, economic and public life of Australian society.</para>
<para class="block">The Committee’s recommendations can be broadly categorised into two groups. First, recommendations that are specific to the issue of sex discrimination and second, recommendations that are also relevant to other areas of anti-discrimination legislation. The Government’s consideration of the Committee’s Report has been informed by the National Human Rights Consultation into the promotion and protection of human rights, which coincided with the Committee’s Report.</para>
<para class="block">In relation to those recommendations which are specific to sex discrimination, the Government proposes to act immediately and amend the SDA to:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>ensure the protections from discrimination provided by the SDA apply equally to women and men, through reference to additional international instruments which create obligations in relation to gender equality</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>establish breastfeeding as a separate ground of discrimination</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>provide greater protection from sexual harassment for students and workers, and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>extend protection from discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities to both women and men in all areas of employment.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">Those recommendations with wider implications for federal anti-discrimination laws will be considered by the Government in light of its broader commitment to streamline and harmonise Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation as part of the Government’s response to the National Human Rights Consultation.</para>
<para class="block">The Government thanks the Senate Committee for its report which will inform the future direction of federal anti-discrimination legislation. Ensuring that anti-discrimination law meets the needs of contemporary Australians is an important part of ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline>

</para>
<para class="block">Noted.</para>
<para class="block">The existing position at common law is that there is an intention that Parliament does not intend to infringe international law, such that courts will prefer an interpretation consistent with international law, though some formulations of the test restricts this to cases where there is an ambiguity in the text. In addition to the common law rule, section I 5AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 allows recourse to international law in specified circumstances (eg ambiguity) where the treaty is referred to in the Act.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">In order to provide protection to same-sex couples from discrimination on the basis of their relationship status, the committee recommends that:</para>

<para class="block">Noted.</para>
<para class="block">Expanding the prohibition on marital status discrimination to include same-sex relationships may impact on the private sector.

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that the definitions of direct discrimination in sections 5 to 7A of the Act be amended to remove the requirement for a comparator and replace this with a test of unfavourable treatment similar to that in paragraph 8(1)(a) of the Discrimination Act 1991 (ACT)</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Noted.</para>
<para class="block">The ADA and DDA also use the comparator test. Any new definition of discrimination would need to be applied consistently across all grounds of discrimination to ensure consistency. The Government will consider this recommendation as part of the consolidation project.</para>

<para class="block">The committee recommends that section 7B of the Act be amended to replace the reasonableness test in relation to indirect discrimination with a test requiring that the imposition of the condition, requirement or practice be legitimate and proportionate.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">Noted.</para>
<para class="block">This test for indirect discrimination is also used in the ADA and the RDA, however the DDA uses a different test.

</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that subsection 9(10) of the Act be amended to refer to ICCPR, ICESCR, and the ILO conventions which create obligations in relation to gender equality, as well as CEDAW, in order to ensure that the Act provides equal coverage to men and women.</para>

<para class="block">International Labour Organisation Convention No. 156 —Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention 1981.</para>
<para class="block">Section 9 draws on a number of Commonwealth heads of power to bring the Act within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth. All heads of power except subsection 9(10) —external affairs—apply equally to men and women. Subsection 9(10) only has effect in relation to discrimination against women, to the extent that the provisions give effect to CEDAW. If a complaint falls in an area where no other head of power applies, such as an unlawful act by an unincorporated body, subsection 9(10) operates to cover women but not men.</para>
<para class="block">The Government believes that the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (SDA) should afford equal protection to men and women, and give effect to Australia’s international obligations. Widening the constitutional basis of the SDA is necessary to ensure that men are equally covered under protections for family responsibilities (see below recommendation 13).</para>

</para>
<para class="block">Noted.</para>
<para class="block">Section 9 of the RDA provides for a broad prohibition on discrimination in ‘the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life’. Section 10 is concerned with the operation and effect of laws. Both sections 9 and 10 of the RDA can invalidate inconsistent State laws.</para>
<para class="block">There are no equivalent provisions in other Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation. The ADA, DDA and SDA adopt a different approach to the RDA and list areas of public life in which discrimination is proscribed.</para>
<para class="block">Inserting a general prohibition provision and equality before the law provision in other anti-discrimination legislation would represent a significant change in approach by the Commonwealth and needs to be considered further in the context of the consolidation project. The recommendations are likely to have a significant impact on State and Territory legislation and would require extensive consultation before implementation.</para>
<para class="block">The Government will consider these recommendations as part of the consolidation project.</para>
<para class="block">

<para class="block">Noted.</para>
<para class="block">There are differing approaches to partnerships in Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation. The ADA and SDA apply to partnerships of 6 or more persons, whereas the DDA applies to partnerships of 3 or more persons. The RDA applies to all partnerships, regardless of their size.</para>
<para class="block">The RDA covers volunteers and independent contractors given the broad scope of section 9. The ADA, DDA and SDA cover contract workers; however there is some uncertainty about the scope of the coverage. Volunteers are not specifically covered in the ADA, DDA and SDA as they do not fall within the traditional definition of ‘employee’.</para>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 11</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The committee recommends that subsection 12(1) of the Act be amended and section 13 repealed to ensure that the Crown in right of the states and state instrumentalities are comprehensively bound by the Act.</para>
<para class="block">

</para>
<para class="block">Noted.</para>
<para class="block">The ADA, DDA and RDA all bind the States and State instrumentalities, while the SDA does not bind the States and State instrumentalities unless expressly provided for.

<para class="block">Breastfeeding is specifically listed as a characteristic that appertains generally to women in subsection 5(1A). Discrimination on the basis of breastfeeding is therefore already captured as direct sex discrimination under section 5. However, making breastfeeding a separate ground of discrimination alongside marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy emphasises that breastfeeding is a protected attribute.</para>

<para class="block">Accepted.</para>
<para class="block">Under subsection 14(3A) of the SDA, discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities is only unlawful where the employee is dismissed. Unlike other grounds of discrimination, the definition is also restricted to direct discrimination. Women are able to use the indirect sex discrimination provision to get around this limitation as they have a disproportionate responsibility for the care of children. Men are unable to argue indirect discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities.</para>
<para class="block">The Fair Work Act 2009 now protects employees from ‘adverse action’, which is not limited to dismissal, on the ground of family responsibilities.

<para class="block">Section 28F of the SDA does not make it unlawful for an adult student to sexually harass a student under 16 years of age, or for a staff member or adult student to sexually harass a victim who attends another institution.</para>
<para class="block">There is no persuasive policy reason for the existing age limit on the victim. Students under 16 years of age should receive equal protection as those over 16 years of age.</para>
<para class="block">The current requirement that the harasser and victim attend the same institution reflects the policy intention that sexual harassment, as with discrimination, should be limited to specified areas of public life. This recommendation potentially imposes on a staff member or an adult student a higher degree of liability for sexual harassment than imposed on the general public in similar circumstances. For example, a teacher may be liable for sexually harassing a student with whom they have no existing relationship outside of the education and employment context, while another adult who is not a teacher engaging in the same conduct would not be liable.</para>
<para class="block">The Government recognises, however, that where there is a connection between the conduct of the staff member towards a student of another educational institution and the staff member’s employment, liability for sexual harassment should be imposed. For example, a staff member who sexually harasses a student of another educational institution at an inter-school event should be liable under section 28F. Similarly, an adult student should be liable for sexually harassing a student who attends another institution where there is a connection between the conduct and their attendance at an educational institution.</para>

It is also unlawful for a worker to sexually harass another person, including a customer, in the course of providing goods, services or facilities. However it is not unlawful for a customer to sexually harass a worker.

<para class="block">This is a report into native vegetation laws, greenhouse gas abatement and climate change measures. It was a particularly interesting inquiry. The inquiry raised many issues that are not normally before this place, because most of this legislation is within the domain of the various states and territories—and this is a key fact about this report. These are state laws, and many of the issues raised by the hundreds of submissions we received related to enforcement of these laws and the behaviour and actions of state governments. The majority report of the committee reflects concerns that have arisen, in some cases decades ago, since the passage of these laws—these are not laws that are merely the product of the last decade—that regulated the management of native vegetation on private land.</para>
<para>I note that these laws have represented a significant change to many. The laws guaranteeing retention of native vegetation on private land represent a change because in past years a condition of title or a condition of lease was in fact the clearing of land. So there has been a substantial change for many involved in the agricultural and pastoral industries who are affected by these laws.</para>
<para>The inquiry highlighted many issues and I would like to outline a few this evening. I know that some of my colleagues—I assume on both sides of the house—will add to this later on. In my view, laws that were once about broad-scale land clearing have now become significantly more about the management of native vegetation on individual properties. We heard of many examples of effective micromanagement of individual properties. In particular, there was an absurd example where a farmer was not allowed to remove a single tree in the middle of a paddock, even if he guaranteed to plant native vegetation elsewhere, that would have allowed much more efficient and modern utilisation of that particular land for farming use. Situations like that are absurd. I think they reflect the change in what these laws originally were about, which was broad-scale land clearing, and how they now seem to have become more about the management of individual properties.</para>
<para>Similarly, many witnesses outlined to us numerous examples of problems with the enforcement of these laws. The committee report highlighted a couple of these. Landholders are in fact liable for the payment of rates on land they cannot use or land that has been locked up, which the committee felt was an issue that needed to be reconsidered. There was also potentially the clash of legal regimes. Laws that required the management of noxious weeds may clash with laws about the retention and management of native vegetation. In certain jurisdictions there is a lack of administrative appeal of certain decisions made on behalf of government officials. It was put to the committee that in the state of Western Australia these decisions were one of the very few decisions that were not able to be appealed through the administrative appeals process of that state. The committee highlighted that as well.</para>
<para>There was also some concern that the state-wide application of laws would not always take into account regional, environmental, economic, social or, indeed, other differences. Even as a federalist myself, the lines drawn as our state boundaries do not always take these differences into account, and there might be a case for more regional flexibility within states. In my view, and in the view of a number of members of the committee, there appears to be at least a partial breakdown in relationships between enforcement agents and property owners. What underpins this? It is difficult to determine this from a simple Senate inquiry at the Commonwealth level into state laws. It is clear that some property owners are bearing a burden on behalf of the wider community. I hasten to add that the committee did not determine it to be inappropriate for the state to regulate the use of private landholdings or how they are utilised, but the committee was of the view that when someone pays for a benefit desired by the broader community through a direct economic cost there is a legitimate claim to consider compensating the landholder in that case for the burden they are bearing.</para>
<para>On a more philosophical level, I think another cause of this is the lack of common ground between urban policy makers and those involved in primary production, be it agriculture or pastoral production, in regional areas. There is much less shared experience, in my view, across the community than there was several generations ago between those who live and are raised in the cities and those who live and are involved in primary production in our regional areas. This lack of understanding has led to a more blunt degree of regulation by the states and a high degree of frustration by those who are regulated. If I look at my own experience, I realise that it is limited itself in this regard, and this is one of the many reasons I found this inquiry particularly interesting.</para>
<para>I make a final comment regarding the additional comments from government senators. Despite the attempts of the government senators to constantly pin the blame for these laws on the Howard government, it is clear that these laws are state laws. They were passed by state parliaments. They are enforced by state enforcement agencies. There is no Commonwealth head of power with respect to land management other than through treaties we have ratified and legislated through this parliament. These issues, such as biodiversity, were not prominent in our hearings or in the submissions received by this committee. These problems are primarily ones of legislation, regulation and enforcement at the state level.</para>
<para>Finally, I express my thanks to my colleagues who participated in this inquiry. It was done under a particularly tight time line. I particularly thank the committee’s secretary, Christine McDonald, and the committee secretariat, who worked extremely long hours during a very tight time line dealing with hundreds of submissions. I also thank the hundreds of Australians who made submissions and the many who appeared at our committee into this inquiry.</para>

<para>—Looking back on the inquiry of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee into native vegetation laws, greenhouse gas abatement and climate change measures, I think it is one of those good ideas that the opposition think they have but when they actually get into the nitty-gritty of the inquiry probably wish they had not sought to do so. The terms of reference of the committee encompass the rhetoric that was being used by the opposition to try to gain support amongst farmers and to try to share blame on anywhere but the coalition on this issue of native vegetation. The terms of reference go to the diminution of land asset value. They go to compensation arrangements for landholders. They go to the method of calculation of asset value and ‘any other related matter’. Yet if you look at the recommendations, which we as government members do not have great problems with, you will see they talk about anything but the terms of reference. Why is that? It is because this was a pure political position being put by the coalition to try to raise their position with farmers around the country. All they did was raise expectations through this inquiry and delivered on nothing. They delivered on nothing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have heard much about hypocrisy in the debates in this chamber this afternoon but, let me tell you, the hypocrisy from the opposition senators on this was huge. The hypocrisy was oozing from every pore in their bodies on this issue. They were up there arguing that there should be compensation when they were talking to farmers outside Parliament House at rallies but, as soon as they had to face some reality, they ran away from that position. I must say the coalition have got form on this whole issue and that form goes back a long way. It goes back to about 1995, when one of those coalition senators, Senator Ian Macdonald, was in the chamber, in opposition. In the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 22 March 1995, he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As opposed to that the coalition’s policy that Senator Kemp and Senator Brownhill have mentioned is a sensible policy. It was put out in our discussion paper and calls for an end to broadacre land clearing with compensation to owners to be negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states for the loss of further earnings, a no regrets approach to greenhouse reduction strategies, and a nationally coordinated reafforestation program.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So this was a ‘no regrets’ policy from the coalition. Well, as soon as they said it, they had regrets, because Senator Macdonald in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 9 March 2000 changed his position. It was not that the Commonwealth should pay compensation because Labor were in government. Because the coalition were in government, it now became the coalition’s policy for an end to broadacre land clearing with compensation, but then they went on to say in 2002:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Commonwealth reiterates—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is the coalition government; this is Senator Macdonald—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">that land clearing is primarily a land management issue and is the responsibility of state and territory governments.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And we heard that repeated again today. Senator Macdonald went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Commonwealth has, however, indicated that it would be prepared to provide a financial contribution commensurate with the reduction in emissions from land clearing negotiated and implemented by the Queensland government. Achieving a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will involve a sizeable and sustained reduction in the ‘business as usual’ clearing rates over the past decade, beyond that flowing from the vegetation management regime in the national action plan.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">When they were in opposition they were always saying to the farmers, ‘The Commonwealth should compensate you.’ When they were in government they ran away from that at a rate of knots. The coalition have got form on it and they are back again with the same form telling farmers that they should be compensated and it is a terrible thing that has happened to them—yet they were the federal government that pushed these laws on the farmers.</para>
<para>You were the ones that pushed it through the states and said the states had to deliver to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Then you go and grandstand to farmers, hypocrisy running out of you. Then, when you have an opportunity to actually stand up for what you were saying, you again run away from the issues. You did not deal with the issues and you must be absolutely clear with farmers; you should be honest with farmers. You should be honest with what you claim is your constituency because, when they find out what you have actually been up to, I do not think they are going to be your constituency for too long. They must realise that this was a con job, that you used this inquiry to give them false hope, that you used this inquiry to grandstand and when you had the opportunity to stand up for what you were saying you did not stand up for it. You ran away from it at a million miles an hour.</para>
<para>This has been going on for some time. There was evidence given by Mr Rheese, the executive director of an organisation that calls itself the Australian Environment Foundation. When I was questioning him I said: ‘Why is it an issue now? Why wasn’t it an issue when the coalition were in government?’ Mr Rheese said, ‘We addressed this at a public meeting in Dubbo in 2003. We tried very hard to get this on the national agenda.’ But Senator Macdonald could not get it on the national agenda for them because he was a minister at the time and he was not interested in getting it on the national agenda. He wants to grandstand now. He wants to say he is standing up for farmers, but the hypocrisy is so clear in relation to the performance of Senator Macdonald on this that the farmers will soon understand what he is about.</para>
<para>I asked whether there were any coalition government members at that meeting in Dubbo and the reply was: ‘Yes. Senator Nash was there.’ I said, ‘What did they put at the meeting?’ They said, ‘Senator Nash did not speak at the meeting.’ Here we have the National Party up ranting and raving about all these issues, but when they were in government there were as meek as lambs, as quiet as mice, not prepared to take the issue up. Now they are in opposition, they do exactly as they did when they were in opposition last time—hypocrisy is everywhere in relation to this.</para>
<para>To be fair to Senator Nash, she was not a senator at the time, but she was at the meeting. I suppose she was there in her employment at the time, which was as an adviser to the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile. The coalition government were all over this issue but what they were doing was trying to keep it quiet—no ministers, no members, at a meeting of 300 farmers complaining about this in Dubbo. When they were in government there were no ministers there running the arguments about compensation, yet they have the hide and the hypocrisy now to be raising these issues but when they had an opportunity to actually put recommendations up on the terms of reference that were drafted by the coalition they ran away from it. There is nothing there that goes to the issues that they laid out as a promise to the farmers.</para>
<para>As I said, we do not have a problem with the broad generalities of the recommendations. We have put up a further 10 recommendations that strengthen the recommendations of the coalition senators on this committee. I think it is about time that the coalition senators were honest with farmers. When they are out there talking about compensation Senator Joyce goes back to the press saying, ‘No, no, we are not going to give compensation; it’s all too expensive.’ They are out there grandstanding to farmers at meetings and telling the press behind the scenes that there is no reason for compensation, that it is all too difficult and that it is all too expensive. Just be honest. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is not a dissenting report. There are additional comments by the Labor Party. The recommendations were the recommendations of the committee. What we have here are the recommendations of the committee, which included senators from the Labor Party. But let us put this behind us and have a debate and try to concentrate on how we can bring about a better outcome for the farmers. The farmers do not want a rhetorical flourish; they want some hope that we can deliver a better outcome. I agree with you, Senator Cameron, that we do not have—and I will say this quite openly—the capacity to compensate every farmer for all the trees that have been taken from them. I say that on the record. We do not because the Labor Party have got us $140 billion in debt as we speak and they are heading towards about a quarter of a trillion dollars in debt.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>If we cannot compensate the farmers, then we must change the legislation. In fact, we must go so far as to give the trees back to them. The trees were stolen from them. They were an asset of the farmers and we proved that through the inquiry. The title specifically said that these assets were assets of the farmers and they were taken from them without the farmers ever being paid for them. I believe both sides of the chamber find that abhorrent. You cannot just wander into someone’s life and take an asset from them without paying for it. We should not believe in that. Once we believe in that, we would not believe in the value of going to work. Why would you go to work to pay for something if there is a prospect that you would not own it?</para>
<para>I hope this report becomes part and parcel of a bipartisan approach to try to take this issue forward and put pressure on to bring about a fairer outcome. I think I heard from those on both sides of the argument say that when people drilled down into this issue—an issue that maybe a lot of people did not know about—they saw how irrational some of these laws had become and how completely arbitrary and ridiculous they were, where you had a person with a number of trees in a wheat paddock and they were not able to get rid of them. Why? We do not know. It was almost a Franz Kafka type of intrusion. This intrusion affects a minority group and we have to move away from thinking that if we do not see them as a minority group they are not a minority group.</para>
<para>Farmers make up less than one per cent of the population. They are generally poor, not rich, to dispel one myth, and they do not have the political power that they should have because people find it convenient to look past them. If this happened to another minority group, there would be a hue and cry about this. Imagine if we went to another group and said, ‘We are going to steal something from you without payment because we believe we are in a position where we can.’ As a social justice issue, surely that should strike a chord and we should be doing something about it now.</para>
<para>I hope that this report does not become a political football but becomes a seed from which we can start to seek and find justice. I am not here to talk about state or federal responsibility and waste the farmers’ time. I am here to talk about exactly what we can do from this point forward and to hear from other people how we can go forward and bring justice to these people who do not have justice at the moment. The people listening to this right now—yes, the history lesson is interesting—are far more interested in how we are going to fix it and what we are going to do about it to try and make their lives better. The reality is that there has been the theft of an asset of the individual by the government, whether or not it was in collusion with the federal government. The theft happened and these people were dispossessed. In some instances, this has without a shadow of a doubt put them in a position where their assets have diminished. In some instances, this asset is worthless, has become without worth and is unsaleable.</para>
<para>We also have the ridiculous situation where a person who owned the trees woke up one day and the trees had become the property of the government. However, they had to pay rates on the land where the trees were, they had to pay the insurance, they had to keep the weeds down and if somebody else’s tree fell on a neighbour or anybody else—a person coming off the road—walking through the place guess who would have been sued. Not the government but the farmer would have got sued. He would have been sued for an asset he did not actually own. How can this be justice? How can this be right? Surely, the focus of the chamber right now should be about trying to bring a remedy. The honourable thing is to seek a remedy, because that is the only way you provide a sense of hope.</para>
<para>These people were told that it was to be done on an environmental basis, and even that has been flawed in many instances. The reality—as we are seeing more and more—is that, if it is based on carbon sequestration, the amount of carbon being stored and quarantined is inferior to the amount of carbon stored by such things as summer pastures. This is just a fact of science. People might have a biodiversity argument, but that was not the argument put up at the time. That was an argument of carbon sequestration.</para>
<para>The issue is: why should you go to a minority group and persecute them for a solution for the wider community? If the wider community believe they need it then the wider community should pay for it, and if the wider community are not prepared to pay for it then the need for it cannot be that great. That is the essence. To describe a similar circumstance, it is like people going to suburban Australia and saying: ‘The need of the community is that we now quarantine the use of your third bedroom for a social good—we’ll probably give that to the homeless—but we’re not going to pay you for it. In fact, you’re still going to have to pay the rates and insurance on it. You have to deal with the impost if you ever try to sell that house now that that is there.’ Obviously, when people see it in that dynamic, they see that it is completely abhorrent.</para>
<para>I definitely want stronger views on compensation, but the issue was that we had a recommendation of a report with no dissent. There is no dissenting report in this. I repeat: there is no dissenting report in this. We have additional comments, but we have no dissent. So this report is without dissent. That means it is without dissent from either the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party or any other party.</para>

<para>—Oh, yes; there is one by the Greens. The Greens dissented, but they are not actually trying to make things better; they are trying to make things worse. The Labor Party did not dissent; therefore they are in agreement with the recommendations. It is as simple as that. The reason that we have kept the recommendations where they were is to keep the Labor Party on board. That is why the recommendations are without dissent: because it is vitally important for this nation and for justice to this minority group that we bring about an outcome that is bipartisan. We now have a bipartisan report and recommendations. Let us not now revel in the rhetoric of history. Let us make sure, if we are people who are going to do something that is right and just, that we move forward from this point as if we were dealing with any other minority group and try to bring about some sense of justice for them. If we do not, then we make a mockery when we do it with other groups, because that means we have a form of partiality as to who deserves justice and who does not. I hope that is not where this chamber goes.</para>

<para>—There are only a couple of minutes left in this debate on the Finance and Public Administration References Committee report on native vegetation laws, greenhouse gas abatement and climate change measures, and I want to make a contribution. Fortunately, no-one listening would ever take any notice of Senator Doug Cameron. He is, after all, a member of the Labor Party, and with the promises they make and never keep you can understand that the people of Australia are now in a situation where they treat with a grain of salt anything Mr Rudd says and anything any of his minions, like Senator Doug Cameron, say, because they have been lied to so many times that they have given up taking any notice of or attributing any veracity to things said by Mr Rudd or by people like Senator Cameron.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Notwithstanding that, I am rather flattered that Senator Cameron has gone back 15 years to look up my words of wisdom in this place. I feel rather touched that Senator Cameron would do that, but perhaps it is worth while just to have a reality check. Back in those days that Senator Cameron was talking about, the Queensland Labor government was determined to stop tree clearing and, in fact, to destroy the value in most properties in Queensland. At the time, the then coalition government was trying to work with the Queensland government and say: ‘Look, don’t do this across the board. We understand the Queensland government’s desire to stop wide-scale tree clearing, but let’s talk about this. Let’s talk to the farmers about it. Let’s talk to the landowners. Let’s try to get a result that is good for the environment, good for farming communities and good for landowners.’ For a considerable amount of time, the Commonwealth government was talking with the Queensland government and urging it to work with landowners to come to a resolution. The Commonwealth government said: ‘Yes, let’s get a negotiated outcome so that everyone wins, and we might contribute some compensation. Provided the Queensland government is prepared to pay compensation to landowners, the Commonwealth will put in some compensation.’ This was how the negotiations were going, and then in the middle of it one morning, without any warning, we woke up and the Queensland government had just made this unilateral announcement that there would be no tree clearing whatsoever and very little compensation. At that stage the federal government, having been completely outflanked in these negotiations we were having with landowners and the Queensland government, simply withdrew from the whole question. That is the truth of the matter. I am not going to have time to finish this, so I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time.</para>

<para class="block">This report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories into the changing economic environment in the Indian Ocean Territories was presented out of session. Through this inquiry, the committee sought to examine the issues associated with economic development in the context of the service delivery of communications, transport and housing; the operation of business; and preparations to deal with the impact of climate change. During the inquiry, several solutions were canvassed in each area examined.</para>
<para>The committee focused on how communications, internet services and mobile telephony were delivered. To improve internet delivery and access, options identified were either to upgrade the satellite link to the Indian Ocean territories or to access a cable if and when it is laid. Improving mobile telephony was found to be more complex as the service available on Christmas Island is limited and the service available on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands prone to failure. New infrastructure will be needed to implement an efficient, reliable and affordable mobile telephony service.</para>
<para>The high cost and unreliability of freight and passenger services have remained major areas of concern for the IOTs. As outlined in previous reports, the committee found that options to improve the service delivery of these in the short term rests with the government through subsidies in infrastructure investment.</para>
<para>Another major issue highlighted was the limited land made available for commercial development and investment. The committee found that investment in the Indian Ocean territories is critical to growing the economies, and has recommended the development of a land release and development strategy to stimulate the local construction industries and investment.</para>
<para>The social impacts accompanying the economic challenges facing the Indian Ocean territories relate to, in part, a diminishing permanent population and the limited contact that occurs with mainland and wider Australian society. In addition there is the challenge of the fluctuating non-permanent population associated with the demands placed on Christmas Island in particular with regard to the detention centre.</para>
<para>The shires of the Indian Ocean territories are focused on addressing the decreasing permanent population by mainly targeting the youth segment that is leaving in search of greater educational and employment opportunities. The committee believes that by improving economic diversity, the economies of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands would be better able to sustain themselves into the future.</para>
<para>In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank individuals and organisations who participated in the inquiry. The committee was able to conduct public hearings on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. I would also like to acknowledge and thank those who generously assisted the committee during that visit. I particularly acknowledge and thank the joint standing committee secretariat, Stephen Boyd and Stephanie Mikac, for their work on this inquiry and also my colleagues on the committee.</para>

<para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I will only be brief on this interim report on the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010. I know that Senator Guy Barnett, who has been very involved as deputy chairman of this committee, has a very keen interest in this legislation.</para>
<para>This committee report is looking at a private member’s bill introduced by Mr Tony Abbott in the other place and introduced in this place by Senator Scullion. It has been referred to a Senate committee to have a look at the bill. The committee met at a number of places, and as a participating member I was able to be involved in the committee hearings in Cairns a few weeks ago. It became quite clear at the Cairns hearing that Indigenous people are absolutely furious, as well they may be, at the action of the Queensland state government in locking up their lands—the lands that they fought so hard to acquire over many decades—in a way that makes ownership of them practically valueless. We heard a considerable amount of evidence from different Indigenous people and groups about how the legislation and the processes were so complex that they restricted any useful activity that could be made on those lands.</para>
<para>This bill, which, as I mentioned, was originally introduced by Tony Abbott, was introduced as a result of a very close connection Mr Abbott has with Indigenous people in Cape York. Most people would not know—I did not until recently myself—that Mr Abbott has been going into Cape York without publicity and without the television cameras in tow. Over the last several years—I have subsequently become aware; I did not know at the time—he has been going up to Cape York, going to an Indigenous community and actually working with Indigenous people in various ways. I understand that in his last visit, which was several months ago and, of course, before he became the Leader of the Opposition, he went up there and worked as a teacher’s aide. Do not hold me to the facts—and Mr Abbott himself never talks about this very much—but others have told me that he goes up there, he lives in the community, he works with the community and he tries to add some value to their lives and, I suspect, to his own life in the way he assists Indigenous communities. He may be embarrassed, I hope not too embarrassed, that I am even raising this, because I know it is something that he has not been wanting to get publicity on. He really went up there to help, to look and to learn.</para>
<para>It was as a result of that close connection that Mr Abbott has had with Cape York communities over several years that he picked up on this anger from Indigenous communities about the wild rivers legislation and how those communities believed that it would impact upon their use of their lands. I know that the Queensland government has said, ‘There have been many applications and a lot of them have been granted,’ but, when you talk to the communities there, most of them would never even have made application for business activities in these wild rivers areas—the whole procedure was too complex and they felt that without resources, which very few of them have, they would be unable to make the case, make the legal challenge, get the accountants, solicitors and whatever was required to make a proper application to be given the ability to use their own land. That has incensed people in Cape York, and one can well understand why that might be.</para>
<para>I know that Senator Barnett will speak at another time on this report. I know there will be other senators who wish to make a contribution at some later stage. I understand, although I personally was not able to get to the committee meeting when this was dealt with, that the return of this report has now been extended by the government majority on this committee to a date which will mean that, quite frankly, the bill will never be able to be debated in this chamber prior to the next election. That is unfortunate, because it is an important area and it is an important bill. It is a bill that was very much sought by Indigenous people in the cape and it would have been good for the Commonwealth parliament to have been able to debate and vote on that bill about overturning the Queensland government’s wild rivers legislation wherever it occurs in Queensland. It would have been a momentous bill because it would have been one of those rare occasions when the Commonwealth parliament overrides the laws of a state under the Commonwealth Constitution, but it was so important for our Indigenous people that Mr Abbott thought that it was very important that the bill be introduced into the parliament, debated and voted upon. I am disappointed that the Labor majority on this committee have now rearranged the reporting date to effectively mean that it will not be able to be voted on prior to the next election. On the assumption that nobody else in the chamber wants to speak on this report at this time, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">It is pleasing to hear that the South Australian government is responding to the Senate’s resolution on the issue around dialysis in Central Australia, and I thank Minister Hill for taking such an interest. However, it is interesting to note that the letter is already somewhat out of date, because the minister talks in his letter about working on a solution for the APY Lands and exploring the feasibility of providing dialysis services on APY Lands, meaning patients would no longer have to travel.</para>
<para>I note the media release of last Friday from the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery, Mr Snowdon, in which he announced that there is going to be a joint study to look into delivery of kidney disease treatment in Central Australia. Again, it is very pleasing to note that the federal government, the state governments of South Australia and Western Australia and the Territory government are joining together to look at the delivery of these services. However, unfortunately the announcement did not include terms of reference for the inquiry. It did say that the inquiry will be completed by the end of the year, which in one way is pleasing in that at least it has a set end date. But, in the meantime, we are still seeing patients urgently needing access to dialysis.</para>
<para>I also note that there was an agreement, which turned out to yet again be an announcement of a tri-state agreement over the provision of dialysis support in Central Australia. It says that some resources will be made available for people interstate—in other words, patients in South Australia and Western Australia accessing dialysis support in Alice Springs. The problem with that is that, while the South Australian government said that they would continue to support existing patients in Alice Springs, by the sounds of it—and it is very difficult to get access to the real information—it appears that from then on they will only fund access for eight patients to receive dialysis in Central Australia. That is in fact a halving of the number of people from South Australia, the APY Lands, who will be able to access Central Australia. That of course means that people on the APY Lands are going to have to travel to Adelaide, Whyalla or Port Augusta. That is, in some instances, over 1,000 kilometres, so that means that people have to relocate permanently from their communities.</para>
<para>I remind the Senate that the debate and the discussions that we have been having have been about enabling people who live in Central Australia to access dialysis support close to their community so that they do not have to travel and remove themselves from the community. Having to do so means that their family is disrupted, they are isolated from their community and they are isolated from their families or their families have to move. They are often receiving treatment and support that is not necessarily entirely culturally appropriate.</para>
<para>Very often these patients do not speak English as a first language. They are often relocated to areas where they do not have people that speak their language or are able to support them in the manner in which they would be if they were supported in their community. I am pleased to see there is some progress. I urge the South Australian government in the interim to ensure that patients on the APY Lands have access to dialysis support in Alice Springs so that they do not have to relocate in some cases over a thousand kilometres from their home. It is essential that the people are able to remain either in their community or close to their community. I remind members that these lands are only 400 kilometres rather than a thousand kilometres from Alice Springs. There are often family members on dialysis already in Alice Springs. In other words, they are not isolated from their communities if they are able to access dialysis support in Alice Springs.</para>
<para>My next urging is that as soon as the government releases the terms of reference for this study that engages very strongly with all communities and all service providers the first consultation be undertaken. In fact, around the issues of the terms of reference, as soon as this study is completed a commitment should be given by both the Commonwealth government and the state and territory governments to come to a long-term planning solution to provide dialysis support in Central Australia. That support needs to be innovative, provided in community, involve training, provide support for nursing staff and accommodation for that nursing staff and ensure that people do not have to travel sometimes over 2,000 kilometres, as in my home state of Western Australia if they have to relocate to Kalgoorlie or Perth, but enables them to remain in community and receive that support. Of course, in the longer term we want to ensure that people do not get to the point of end stage kidney disease. We want appropriate health programs in place that ensure that they do not ever get to the stage of needing dialysis.</para>

<para class="block">The Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 will amend the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to strengthen accountability and transparency through reform of Norfolk Island’s administrative law, governance, electoral and financial structures. In addition, the bill will amend the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 to provide a vesting mechanism for powers and functions under Western Australian laws applied in the Indian Ocean territories. While the bill has two purposes, the bill’s main component relates to Norfolk Island.</para>
<para>The reforms contained in the bill were announced by the then Minister for Home Affairs in May 2009. At that time, the government of Norfolk Island welcomed moving towards greater transparency and accountability to strengthen administrative and financial systems and thereby improving Norfolk Island’s long term stability.</para>
<para>I am very conscious of the time. The committee has made four recommendations which it commends to the government. In the brief time available to me, I would like to thank all those who participated in the inquiry and acknowledge the work of the secretariat. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<inline ref="R4310">National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The purpose of the <inline ref="R4310">bill</inline> is to repeal the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 and to put in place a proper process to establish a facility for managing, at a single site, radioactive waste arising from medical, industrial and research uses of radioactive material.</para>
<para class="block">Australia has international obligations to properly manage its own radioactive waste.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill represents a responsible and long overdue approach for an issue that impacts on all Australian communities.</para>
<para class="block">It provides procedural fairness- a right for people to be heard, as outlined in the Bill, - on decisions as to where a facility should be built.</para>
<para class="block">At the same time the Bill ensures that the Australian Government has appropriate powers to make arrangements for the safe and secure management of radioactive waste generated, possessed or controlled by the Commonwealth.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill enables the Commonwealth to act in good faith and spirit with respect to the Site Nomination Deed entered into by the Northern Land Council, the Muckaty Aboriginal Land Trust and the Commonwealth in 2007.</para>
<para class="block">Radioactive Waste</para>
<para class="block">Australia produces low level and intermediate level waste through its use of radioactive materials.</para>
<para class="block">Low level waste includes lightly contaminated laboratory waste, such as paper, plastic, glassware and protective clothing, contaminated soil, smoke detectors and emergency exit signs.</para>
<para class="block">Intermediate level waste arises from the production of nuclear medicines, from overseas reprocessing of spent research reactor fuel and from disused medical and industrial sources such as radiotherapy sources and soil moisture meters.</para>
<para class="block">As can be seen the generation of low level and intermediate level radioactive waste is an unavoidable result of many worthwhile activities.</para>
<para class="block">During the past 50 years, about 4,000 cubic metres of low level and short‑lived intermediate level radioactive waste has accumulated in Australia. It is currently stored at interim facilities including a multitude of small stores located in suburban and regional areas across Australia.</para>
<para class="block">By comparison, countries such as Britain and France <inline font-style="italic">annually</inline> produce around 25,000 cubic metres of low and intermediate level waste. But unlike the current situation in Australia, Britain and France dispose of such waste in purpose built repositories.</para>
<para class="block">In addition to providing proper disposal of Australia’s low level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive waste, the facility to be established under this Bill will also be suitable for storing the approximately 32 cubic metres of long-lived intermediate level nuclear waste arising from reprocessing ANSTO’s spent research reactor fuel. This material will return to Australia from France and the United Kingdom in 2015 and 2016.</para>
<para class="block">Beneficial Uses of Radioactive Materials</para>
<para class="block">Radioactive materials have a variety of important uses in medicine, industry, agriculture, environment and sterilisation, as well as in our homes.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) is a public research organisation responsible for delivering specialised advice, scientific services and products to government, industry, academia and other research organisations.</para>
<para class="block">Nuclear medicine production is a core business of ANSTO, which provides around 85 per cent of the nuclear medicines to Australian hospitals to help doctors diagnose and treat a range of diseases including cancer.</para>
<para class="block">Around 500,000 patients annually, benefit from a radioisotope in medical procedures such as cancer diagnosis and treatment.</para>
<para class="block">Responsible management of radioactive waste</para>
<para class="block">However, accepting these benefits means also accepting the responsibility to safely manage resulting radioactive waste. The two must go hand in hand.</para>
<para class="block">Australia also needs to comply with its international obligations to manage radioactive waste.</para>
<para class="block">As a party to the <inline font-style="italic">Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management</inline>, we need to promote the consistent, safe and responsible management of radioactive waste.</para>
<para class="block">We need a long term solution to this unavoidable, but not unmanageable issue.</para>
<para class="block">National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 1</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 1 of the Bill repeals the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 (the current Act) and amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (the ADJR Act).</para>
<para class="block">The repeal of the current Act meets a 2007 ALP Platform commitment.</para>
<para class="block">Key decisions under the current Act are not susceptible to review under the ADJR Act.</para>
<para class="block">Decisions under this Bill will be reviewable.</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 2</para>
<para class="block">A site on Ngapa clan land at Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory has already been nominated and approved as a site under the current Act.</para>
<para class="block">The Government will honour the Commonwealth’s existing commitments to the Ngapa traditional owners made by the previous government in 2007.</para>
<para class="block">Accordingly, Schedule 2 contains a saving provision to ensure that the site will remain an approved site.</para>
<para class="block">Procedural fairness requirements will apply to any decision to select the site, as the site for a facility.</para>
<para class="block">Part 2 –Nomination of sites</para>
<para class="block">The current Act allows for the selection of a site for a facility only in the Northern Territory.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill will allow the Minister to make a declaration allowing people to make voluntary, nation-wide nominations.</para>
<para class="block">However, in deciding whether to make a declaration, the Minister must have regard to whether it is unlikely that a facility will be able to be constructed and operated on Aboriginal that has been land nominated as a potential site under the Bill.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill provides that a Land Council in the Northern Territory may nominate land as a potential site. Under the existing Site Nomination Deed, the Northern Land Council is entitled to nominate other sites on Ngapa land. This provision will enable that entitlement to continue.</para>
<para class="block">Importantly, procedural fairness requirements will apply to any decision to approve a potential site and to any decision to open the nation-wide volunteer site-nomination process.</para>
<para class="block">In accordance with the 2007 ALP Platform, three sites on Defence land in the Northern Territory identified by the former Government have been removed from further consideration as potential sites.</para>
<para class="block">Part 3-Selecting the site for a facility</para>
<para class="block">A decision to select a site should not be taken lightly.</para>
<para class="block">Cautious and comprehensive evaluation is necessary to verify whether a site is suitable for a facility, to ensure the safe management of Australia’s radioactive waste and protection of people and the environment.</para>
<para class="block">Flora and fauna samples need to be collected, meteorological and hydrological conditions must be evaluated and heritage investigations must take place, before selecting a site.</para>
<para class="block">These activities have a minor impact on land but could lead to significant delays if they do not proceed as required.</para>
<para class="block">Part 3 of the Bill allows relevant persons to conduct activities for the purpose of selecting a site.</para>
<para class="block">Certain State, Territory and Commonwealth laws will not apply to activities under Part 3 to the extent that they would regulate, hinder or prevent these activities.</para>
<para class="block">Part 4-Acquisition or extinguishment of rights and interests.</para>
<para class="block">Part 4 of the Bill allows the Minister to select a site, as the site for a facility, and to identify land required for an access road to the site.</para>
<para class="block">Procedural fairness requirements will apply to these decisions.</para>
<para class="block">Part 4 of the Bill allows for the acquisition or extinguishment of rights and interests in relation to the selected site and land required for an access road.</para>
<para class="block">Part 4 of the Bill provides that the Minister may establish a regional consultative committee, once a site has been selected for a facility.</para>
<para class="block">The Government is committed to ensuring community input and an open dialogue with regional interests on this important project.</para>
<para class="block">Part 5-Conducting activities in relation to selected site</para>
<para class="block">Part 5 of the Bill authorises certain persons to conduct activities on the selected site for the purposes of constructing a facility.</para>
<para class="block">In conducting these activities the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 must be complied with.</para>
<para class="block">However certain other State, Territory and Commonwealth laws will not apply to activities under Part 5 to the extent that they would regulate, hinder or prevent these activities.</para>
<para class="block">Part 6-Granting of rights and interest in land to original owners</para>
<para class="block">Part 6 of the Bill preserves rules in the current Act allowing the Minister to grant certain acquired rights and interests, back to the original owners.</para>
<para class="block">This refers to land that was nominated by a Land Council, before the opening of the nation-wide volunteer site-nomination process.</para>
<para class="block">Part 7- Miscellaneous</para>
<para class="block">Under Part 7 the Bill provides for affected parties, if there are any, to be compensated on just terms, where land is acquired for a facility.</para>

<para class="block">Shipping is vital for world trade, particularly for an island nation such as Australia.</para>
<para class="block">Nearly 4,000 ships carry commodities to and from Australia’s shores each year, carrying 99 per cent of our imports and exports, by volume. Australia has the 5th largest shipping task in the world.</para>
<para class="block">It is inevitable that with such a large amount of shipping there will be pollution of the oceans and the atmosphere. As a Government, we are committed to preventing and reducing marine pollution where possible.</para>
<para class="block">The best way of doing this is to ensure that Australian legislation reflects international standards.</para>
<para class="block">This <inline ref="R4276">bill</inline> will amend two Acts to strengthen Australia’s comprehensive marine pollution prevention regime.</para>
<para class="block">The International Maritime Organization (IMO), whose headquarters are in London, has adopted a number of Conventions which are intended to reduce pollution by ships.</para>
<para class="block">The most important of these Conventions is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships which is generally referred to as MARPOL.</para>
<para class="block">MARPOL has six technical Annexes which deal with different aspects of marine pollution. These are pollution by oil, noxious liquid substances in bulk, harmful substances carried by sea in packaged form, sewage, garbage and air pollution.</para>

<para class="block">Australia has adopted all six.</para>

<para class="block">Adverse public health effects associated with air pollution include premature mortality, cardio-pulmonary disease, lung cancer and chronic respiratory ailments.</para>
<para class="block">Annex VI places an upper limit on the emission of nitrogen oxides from marine diesel engines, limits the emission of sulphur oxides by limiting the sulphur content of fuel oil and prohibits the deliberate emission of ozone depleting substances from ships.</para>
<para class="block">Amendments to Annex VI, which were agreed to by the IMO in October 2008, will enter into force on 1 July 2010. The main effect of these amendments is to provide for a progressive reduction in the permitted sulphur level in fuel oil used in ships.</para>
<para class="block">The current maximum sulphur content of 4.5% will be reduced to 3.5% from 1 January 2012. Subject to a review to be conducted in 2018 by the IMO, it is further proposed that the sulphur content of fuel oil be reduced to 0.5% from 1 January 2020.</para>
<para class="block">The IMO has agreed that some parts of the seas which are close to heavily populated areas be designated as Emission Control Areas. An Emission Control Area is an area in which there is a proven need for a further reduction of emissions from ships for health reasons.</para>
<para class="block">At present, only two areas have been designated as Emission Control Areas – the Baltic Sea and the North Sea.</para>
<para class="block">The current permitted sulphur content in fuels used in Emission Control Areas is 1.5%. It will be reduced to 1% from 1 July 2010 and to 0.1% from 1 January 2015.</para>
<para class="block">In order to implement the progressive reduction in permitted sulphur content of fuel oil, the Bill provides for the maximum sulphur content to be set by regulation.</para>
<para class="block">The proposed reduction in sulphur fuel content to 3.5 % from 1 January 2012 will have little practical impact on vessel operations in Australia. That is because the average sulphur level in world-wide fuel oil deliveries and the sulphur levels in fuel refined in Australia currently fall below the 3.5% cap.</para>
<para class="block">Another important aspect of this Bill is to provide protection for persons or organisations who assist in the cleanup following a spill of fuel oil from a ship.</para>
<para class="block">Recent experience demonstrates that even small oil spills can be very costly. For example, the cleanup and compensation costs following the spill of about 270 tonnes of fuel oil from the Pacific Adventurer off the south-east coast of Queensland in March 2009 exceeded 30 million Australian dollars.</para>
<para class="block">It is therefore essential that persons or organisations not be deterred from providing assistance because they think they may become liable if their actions inadvertently lead to increased pollution.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill includes a so-called responder immunity provision to protect persons and organisations who respond to a spill of fuel oil from liability provided they have acted reasonably and in good faith.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill continues the Government’s efforts to enhance Australia’s marine pollution prevention regime.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Statement by the President —matters raised during question time on 11 May 2010</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Earlier today, Senator Bob Brown took a point of order about the use of the term ‘illegal entrants’ by Senator Brandis in a question directed to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Senator Brown claimed that as the description was arguable it was therefore contrary to standing order 73. Although I informed the Senate that I had ruled before on this question, I undertook to have a look at it.</para>
<para class="block">I have ruled before on several occasions that terms of this nature are not out of order. My rulings are in accordance with established rules of the Senate.</para>
<para class="block">Standing order 73 prevents the use of arguments, inferences or imputations, among other things, in questions. The fact that the accuracy of a term is disputed does not mean that it amounts to an argument, an inference or an imputation. It was on this basis that I ruled that the term was not out of order.</para>
<para class="block">Past Presidents have ruled over many decades that it is not the role of the Chair to judge the accuracy or truthfulness of senators’ statements, and that statements by senators are not out of order merely on the basis that they are alleged to be inaccurate. This is a matter for refutation in debate, and not a question of order for the Chair.</para>

<para>—I thank the Senate. I will not take that long. I and my colleagues take this matter very seriously. You responded to my request, Mr President, to make a ruling on a point of order which I took in question time today when Senator Brandis on a number of occasions referred to refugees to this country as ‘illegals’. The point that we make here is that refugees coming by boat to this country are not illegals. It has been shown that over 90 per cent end up being classified as genuine refugees. The term ‘illegals’ applied to refugees is pejorative and worse—I will not use the terms that I think are appropriate to it. It is scaremongering and it vilifies a small number of people who do not deserve to be treated in that fashion. I reiterate that the people are not illegal and therefore the term is wrongly applied to them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>You would be aware, Mr President, that the rules of this place provide that you shall not use in questions put to the chair ‘imputations, inferences or arguments’. There could be no clearer case of imputations, inferences and arguments than people who are genuinely within the law being labelled ‘illegals’ in a question put across the chamber. It should stop. I note that you have now tabled a statement which points out that you have ruled on several occasions that terms of this nature are not out of order and that your rulings are in accordance with established rules of the Senate. You have inter alia made it very clear that you are making a ruling. You are reiterating past rulings. It is that that I am dissenting from.</para>
<para>This is a very clear case of dissent from a ruling you have made to uphold previous rulings—not on the question Senator Brandis made across the chamber today, obviously, but on similar or related matters. It is proper for me to be able to dissent from that ruling and it is proper for the Senate chamber to debate that matter under standing orders tomorrow when we resume. This is an extremely important matter; I would not be raising it if it were not. I am not at all in agreement with the statement you made to the chamber in response to my request to you to make a ruling. You have effectively made a ruling. I am dissenting from that ruling. I put forward a motion of dissent to you in the chair.</para>

<para>—It seems as though we are going to get bogged down, Senator Brown. I cannot entertain a motion of dissent because I have not made a ruling. I responded with a statement to the question which you raised today. I indicated at that time, and I ruled today, that I was being consistent with the past practices in this chamber. I then undertook, because you sought to take a further point of order, that I would look at the matter and get back to you with a statement. I came back to the chamber this evening. I tabled the statement and with the concurrence of the Senate I had it incorporated. I do not think I have circulated it to other people at this stage. I wanted to get the matter back on the record. I am saying to you that I cannot entertain a motion of dissent from a ruling when it is not a ruling.</para>

<para>—You have just made it abundantly clear, President, that you did rule today on the matter. Then you accepted my invitation to review that and make a statement to the chamber—in which you have maintained the ruling that you made today. I am dissenting from that ruling. I am happy to let the matter remain and for you to look at it again overnight. I do not want to have this prosecuted immediately, but I believe I am right here and I do not want to forego my opportunity to dissent from what I think was a breach of standing order 73 by Senator Brandis today. I could dissent from your ruling that you have not made a ruling. That in itself is valid. But, in one way or other, this matter must be tested before the chamber, President. I am happy to wait until tomorrow for you to look at it again, but I am not going to accept that I cannot move dissent from a ruling that you made today on the use of the term ‘illegals’ being valid when I believe it infringes very clearly standing order 73.</para>

<para>—I think I have made the position quite clear, Senator Brown. The best advice I have—and I believe it is the correct advice—is that there is no matter of a ruling before the chamber at this stage. As I said to you, I did—and I will check the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>—when this matter was raised earlier today, make a statement about it. I have come back to you with a statement that I think clarifies the position. If you would like this matter referred to the Procedure Committee, I am quite happy to refer the matter to the Procedure Committee for further investigation. But, at this stage, I cannot see where there is anywhere to go with the matter.</para>

<para>—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Government is undertaking more detailed consultations with ISPs on the implementation of ISP‑level filtering of the Refused Classification Content list, including the requirements for ISPs in regard to the ongoing operation of their filtering solution. An aim is to ensure that enforcement arrangements will be sufficiently flexible to deal with the practicalities of managing an ISP network service.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Standard government contractual reporting requirements would apply to those ISPs that receive funding through the grants program being established to encourage ISPs to offer wider filtering services.</para>
<para>        The effectiveness of wider filtering solutions will be assessed as part of the program’s initial assessment process. Periodic audits may also be undertaken to ensure that minimum standards continue to be met.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Oversight arrangements will be considered during consultations with ISPs.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Government has been advised that some solutions already run adequately on IPv6 networks, given that they operate via URL based lists. Translation from URL to IPv4 addresses is handled by a separate Domain Name Server (DNS) which is not related to the filtering product, therefore the filter itself may not need to be IPv6 “aware” as the IPv6 capable DNS will perform the translation independently.</para>
<para>        Vendors that wish to supply services and products to clients who have deployed IPv6 will ensure that their development programs encompass these technologies.</para>
<para>        It is also anticipated that ISPs who are planning on moving to a native IPv6 network would ensure that all network infrastructure technologies in their network are compatible with IPv6, including any filtering products.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>See 2578 (4)</para>
<para>        The Government has been advised that IPv6 technologies may make blocking sites easier due to the fact that content hosts will not be able to as easily hide behind network address translation or virtual hosts as they can with IPv4 networks. It will also be easier to link the owners of the IPv6 range with the content host.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>An unencrypted URL used to establish an encrypted channel can be filtered if it is found to contain Refused Classification content, however the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) traffic cannot be blocked once it has been encrypted.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>HTTPS is a web protocol built into browsers that encrypts and decrypts user page requests as well as the pages that are returned by the Web server. Communications carried over the HTTPS protocol can not be filtered by URL due to their encryption of the URL information.</para>
<para>        However, when an end user requests an HTTPS URL in the first instance, this initial HTTPS URL request is not encrypted and can therefore be filtered at the ISP level.</para>
<para>        The RC Content list will be URL based meaning only specific webpages or images will be blocked not entire sites.</para>
<para>(8)   (a and b) DNSSEC is a set of extensions to the existing Domain Name System (DNS) to provide security. Normal DNS operations are vulnerable to a range of attacks whereby, for example, malicious parties can redirect requests for a domain name to an unrelated Internet Protocol (IP) address containing a fraudulent website. DNSSEC uses digital signatures and public key encryption to provide users assurance that such tampering has not occurred.</para>
<para>        Most ISP level filtering solutions do not involve the DNS in their operation and therefore will not affect DNSSEC, nor will they be affected by DNSSEC.</para>

<para>The Australian Communications and Media Authority currently reviews on a quarterly basis the existing ACMA blacklist – the list of URLs of prohibited and potential prohibited content that is provided to accredited software vendors, currently maintained under Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The review determines whether the URLs on the ACMA blacklist continue to provide access to prohibited or potential prohibited content. If a URL does not provide access to prohibited content or potential prohibited content when the list is reviewed, it is removed from the list. At the completion of each quarterly review of the list, a replacement list is sent to the filter software vendors whose products are accredited by the Internet Industry Association to receive the list.</para>
</item>
<item label="(10)">
<para>There is no automated monitoring of URLs on the list currently maintained by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and provided to filter software vendors under Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The code of practice and regulatory framework under which the list is maintained do not require the list to be monitored. The current process for quarterly, ‘manual’ reviews of the list is considered to be appropriate for the current filtering arrangements, which are based on voluntary use of filter software by end‑users.</para>
<para>        The Australian Communications and Media Authority intends to develop systems to manage the Refused Classification Content list once the regulatory framework for the list is in place and will consider the requirement for monitoring of the list as part of this process. The system would also be used to manage the ACMA blacklist that will continue to be maintained by the ACMA pursuant to the existing requirements of Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.</para>

<para>Complaints received by the Australian Communications and Media Authority about online content often relate to more than one ‘item’ of content. An item can be an individual web page, image, video file or newsgroup posting. Decisions to refer material to a law enforcement agency are taken on a per item basis. The Australian Communications and Media Authority does not refer entire complaints to law enforcement agencies.</para>
<para>        In 2009, the Australian Communications and Media Authority referred nine such items of content hosted in Australia to an Australian State or Territory police force.</para>
<para>        In 2009, the Australian Communications and Media Authority referred 845 items of content hosted outside Australia to the Australian Federal Police or an INHOPE member hotline.</para>

<item label="(13)">
<para>(a) URLs on the ACMA blacklist are all overseas hosted content.  It would be for the law enforcement agency in the country concerned to undertake any investigation, which may take a considerable amount of time to complete.

</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>Independently of any feedback received from law enforcement agencies, the Australian Communications and Media Authority reviews the list of URLs of prohibited and potential prohibited content, currently maintained under Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they continue to provide access to prohibited or potential prohibited content. If a URL does not provide access to prohibited content or potential prohibited content when the list is reviewed, it is removed from the list.

<para>—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Due to the size and dynamic nature of the internet, and the fact that individual URLs do not display a classification, it is not possible to quantify the probability of being exposed to Refused Classification material on the internet. </para>
<para>        Content is added to the existing ACMA blacklist as a result of a public complaints mechanism.  As people who are deliberately seeking RC content are unlikely to complain about it, people who do complain about content can reasonably be believed to have been inadvertently exposed to it.  Since 2000, some 4,500 items of RC content have been added to the blacklist, with 644 items of RC content on the ACMA blacklist at 30 November 2009.</para>
<para>        Mandatory ISP-level filtering of the Refused Classification Content list will help prevent inadvertent exposure to those URLs on the list.</para>
<para>(2)   (a and b) Material that has been classified Refused Classification cannot legally be shown, distributed, sold or made available for hire in Australia. There is therefore limited information about exposure to Refused Classification material.</para>
<para>        The Edith Cowan University Review of Existing Australian and International Cyber-safety Research commissioned by the Government and released in September 2009 reported that there is very limited information from Australian-based research studies on exposure to pornography, media violence, hate groups or self-harm content.

<para>The mandatory filtering of Refused Classification content will apply to all ISPs, regardless of the device used to connect to the internet.</para>
<para>        The overall level of take up for wider levels of filtering beyond the Refused Classification Content list will depend on the number of ISPs who participate in the proposed grants program, and the number of customers these ISPs have to whom the service would be offered. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is consulting industry on the development of programs to encourage ISPs to offer wider levels of filtering.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>ISPs who participate in the proposed grants program will be able to offer the wider ISP-level filtering services to their customers on a commercial basis, although financial incentives under the program can be expected to ameliorate costs. By encouraging more ISPs to offer this service it is expected that competition will keep prices down.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The proposed grants program will encourage ISPs to offer wider ISP-level filtering services to their customers. The grants program will include incentives to encourage ISPs to maximise take up. See 2585 (2).</para>

<para>The Government allocated $125.8 million for its cyber‑safety package in the 2008‑09 Budget.</para>
<para>        The new measures announced by the Government to enhance its existing cyber‑safety program total $40.8 million over five years from 2009‑10 to 2013‑14 and are all funded from within existing cyber-safety funding.</para>
<para>        Given pending procurement activities associated with ISP filtering it would be inappropriate to break down the funding for ISP filtering any further at this stage.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The mandatory ISP filtering scheme will only apply to content that falls within the Refused Classification category and not the X18+ or R18+ category.</para>
<para>        It will be up to ISP’s and families to determine categories of content that they wish to include in wider, optional levels of filtering. Many filter vendors use extensive commercial lists which provide very granular levels of control over content categories.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>Many ISP-level filtering technologies offer dynamic filtering of content (e.g. key word search) which some ISPs may choose to provide on a commercial basis to customers who request a wider filtered service (in addition to filtering of the Refused Classification Content list).</para>
<para>        The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is consulting with industry on an acceptable level of over-blocking for participation in the grants assistance program.</para>
<para>        The grants programs will be developed to encourage ISPs to offer wider levels of filtering that meet industry ‘best‑practice’ for any impact on internet speeds.</para>

<para>The Brighton Bypass project was approved under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). In approving the Brighton Bypass project, my responsibilities were confined to significant impacts on matters of national environmental significance, in this case nationally listed threatened species. The area was not listed as a National Heritage Place at the time of the assessment so heritage matters could not be considered as part of the EPBC assessment. Therefore no conditions were made regarding Aboriginal heritage issues.</para>
<para>States and Territories have the primary responsibility for protecting Aboriginal heritage. If you wish to pursue this matter further, you may wish to contact Aboriginal Heritage Tasmania on 03 6233 6613.</para>
<para>Aboriginal artifacts have recently been found at the Jordan River, part of the Brighton Bypass site. I understand that Tasmania’s Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources (DIER) may be planning to extend the Jordan River bridge to avoid disturbing the area where the artifacts have been found. My department is working with DIER to determine whether any further consideration under the EPBC Act is required.</para>

<para>Tax law imposes the general interest charge (GIC) in all cases where an entity pays their tax debts late. However, the ATO will remit all or part of the GIC where it is fair and reasonable to do so.</para>

<para>- fast tracking refunds that may be due to the taxpayer</para>

<para>- allowing more time to lodge activity statements or tax returns without incurring penalties</para>

<para>- remitting penalties or interest that may have been imposed.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>Under tax law, taxpayers are entitled to interest where the ATO pays certain tax refunds late. The ATO will pay interest in these circumstances. For example, if the ATO takes longer than 30 days to process an individual’s income tax return, the ATO pays interest on any refund due.</para>
<para>Interest is paid for the period beginning from the thirtieth day after the day on which the income tax return is received by the ATO and ends on the day that the notice of assessment is issued.</para>
<para>The interest is paid at a rate based on the monthly average yield of 90-day Bank Accepted Bills published by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The rates are 3.95% (1 January to 31 March 2010) and 4.16% (1 April to 30 June 2010).</para>

<para>Tenders are assessed against a specific set of criteria to determine a short list of tenderers that may progress to interview. The initial assessment occurs at the State Mail Contract Management Centre and interviews are undertaken locally by the Delivery Manager.</para>

</item>
<item label="(d)">
<para>Yes, since the contract commenced in July 2007 the payment has varied a number of times in accordance with the Mail Contractor Agreement. These variations have been due to increases in the number of delivery points, requests for annual contract reviews and periodic fuel reviews.</para>

<para>Maiden Gully received a large volume of “Fire Ready” packs (approx 470 grams each) that required delivery through the busy Christmas period. Articles were addressed to residents on the electoral role hence most delivery points received more than one article per household.</para>
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The timetable for delivery of the “Fire Ready” packs to targeted areas across Victoria was originally based on an October/November 2009 delivery. However, delays to the production and availability of the information pack, out of Australia Post’s control, saw the delivery slip to December 2009.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The original delivery estimate of a week was based on an October/November delivery. Australia Post met with the customer and explained that due to the slippage in the time of lodgement, the quantity and availability of the lodgement, the article size and the delivery area density, Australia Post could not meet the original delivery estimate during the busy December period. The customer agreed that there would need to be some flexibility with the delivery timetable and was kept aware of progress by Australia Post.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>As far as Maiden Gully was concerned, the information packs were delivered from 30 November to 17 December 2009.</para>
<para>The articles were progressively dispatched to Maiden Gully from the Bendigo Mail Centre to align with storage capacity at Maiden Gully and the contractor’s delivery capability.</para>

<para>—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">(1), (2) and (3) The Government acknowledges that the Dutch Forces have been, and continue to be, a first rate partner to the ADF in Oruzgan province. Our forces work well together and have garnered mutual respect and delivered significant progress together. The Government is in constant communications with the Netherlands and our coalition partners to outline the way ahead in Oruzgan given the imminent withdrawal of the Netherlands mission. These communications include plans for the continuation of all current support in Oruzgan province post the Netherlands withdrawal.</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The care and welfare of Australian troops is the Governments highest priority. The current coalition medical support and evacuation care, augmented by Australian medical staff, provided to our troops has been of the highest quality. Defence is conducting planning with our coalition partners to ensure that a high quality medical service provided by a coalition partner is operating during and post the Netherlands withdrawal. The Government will ensure high quality medical support is provided to Australian troops for the duration of the deployment in Afghanistan.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The Government considers the provision of high quality air support to our troops as mission critical. To date the Netherlands and United States have provided this high quality air support to Australian troops. The ADF is not considering the deployment of Tiger helicopters to Afghanistan to support Australian troops as the current air support provided by coalition partners is very good. The Government does not expect a reduction in this coalition air support when the Netherlands withdraws as the United States and coalition air support will remain available to Australian troops.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>As I have stated previously, the Government views protecting soldiers from rockets, artillery and mortars as an absolute priority. I have asked the Chief of the Defence Force to develop options to deploy the best currently available C-RAM Sense and Warn system to Oruzgan province as a matter of the highest urgency. In order to assist with this, Defence is engaging closely with its Coalition partners who have significant experience with C-RAM Sense and Warn systems.</para>

<para>Three permanent staff were employed at Baxter IDC when it closed in August 2007 (the remainder were temporary transfers and were redeployed in their home locations). Of these three employees, one accepted a VR while the remaining two elected retention. Both employees were aged over 45 years and were therefore entitled to a 13-month period in which to seek redeployment in the department or the APS more broadly.</para>
<para>The department was able to place both employees locally in Centrelink but after a short period of time the employees decided against continuing their placements. The department agreed to pay out the balance of their retention periods (6 and 7 months respectively) at the employees’ request.

<item label="(2)">
<para>Can the Minister provide an explanation of what is meant by ‘up to’ $7 million per annum funding and does that amount include the annual funding of the reef rescue program (i.e. the Reef Rescue Marine Monitoring Program) that is managed by the Reef &amp; Rainforest Research Centre (RRRC) in Cairns on behalf of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; if so, is it true that the actual reduction in funding to the north Queensland research community is actually a reduction of 44 per cent, not 30 per cent as previously thought.</para>

<item label="(3)">
<para>Given that the people of north Queensland understood earlier in 2010 that the new MTSRF arrangements for 2010 onwards would include continued funding for rainforest and Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments research managed out of north Queensland and this funding has been successfully managed by the RRRC for the past 4 years, and prior to that, by the rainforest Cooperative Research Centre and other organisations located in north Queensland: Can the Minister: (a) confirm that his commitment was to continue this rainforest and GBR catchments funding through the RRRC; and (b) explain why jobs and research in far north Queensland are being reduced by the department by either 30 or 44 per cent.</para>

<item label="(4)">
<para>Given that the transition funding for Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities (CERF) programs will be $5 million for up to 6 months, and that the CERF programs have been funded to the extent of $100 million over 4 years, which is the equivalent to $12.5 million for each 6 months: (a) can the Minister confirm that this is a funding reduction of 60 per cent or $7.5 million; and (b) how does the Minister propose to maintain the capacity of research institutes, researchers and their families facing such a shortfall in transition funding at such short notice.</para>

<para>There will be no funding allocated to MTSRF because it ceases to exist at the end of the current phase of the CERF program in June 2010.  Under the new program, funding for the GBR and Torres Strait Hub will be ‘up to $7 million’.  The exact amount is yet to be determined.</para>

<para>No. This is not correct because the transition funding is only part of CERF funding for 2010/11.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The original CERF program was a four year program, designed to end on 30 June 2010. The allocation of $5 million transition funding is designed to maintain capacity within the research institutes and facilitate continuing work which is relevant to the future program. The transition funding will bridge the gap between the end of the current program on 30 June 2010, and the time required (3-6 months) to establish the future program.</para>

<item label="(5)">
<para>The arrangements for administration of the current MTSRF program were allocated following a competitive procurement process. Funding for administration under the future program will similarly be allocated on a competitive basis, to ensure that the Government and taxpayers maximise the return on this investment. The RRRC will be eligible to apply, along with all other potentially interested administrators, to compete for the available funds.</para>
<para>        No decisions have been made on the location of administration of rainforest and catchment research, as this will be an outcome of the competitive process for future research.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>As the answer to Question 1 indicated, MTSRF will no longer exist under the future program.  The future research program for the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait Hub will be developed in consultation with key end users, including my department and relevant portfolio agencies, a broad range of researchers and other end users such as tourism and other industries. The role of RRRC in this process will depend on the outcome of competitive processes yet to be undertaken.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">SBS has advised that the following expenditure is for SBS’s Australian-based television production costs and Australian-based content commissioned by SBS from Australian independent production companies.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">SBS’s television production expenditure is for in-house production of SBS’s news and current affairs and sports programming (including sports rights acquisitions for Australian-based events purchased from Australian-based companies), covering Australian and international events. The majority of SBS’s internal television production occurs at its production centre in Sydney. SBS operates news bureaux in Canberra and Melbourne.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Expenditure for commissioned content is based on total SBS commitment as at program delivery date and production company location. Expenditure data is collated on the basis of production company location, which does not necessarily represent the actual location/s where filming took place. For example: the production company for the drama series The Circuit is located in Victoria, but both series were shot entirely on location in Broome; while the production company for the documentary series First Australians is located in NSW, each episode was filmed in different locations throughout Australia, covering NSW (episodes 1 and 6), Tasmania (episode 2), Victoria (episodes 3 and 6), Northern Territory (episode 4), Western Australia (episode 5), and Queensland (episode 7).</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">All SBS local production (other than sport and news and current affairs programming) is commissioned from the Australian independent production sector. Funding is leveraged with state, territory and federal funding bodies for a majority of the productions. Amounts invested are subject to fluctuation for a number of reasons including varying lengths of production time, varying genre costs, with drama series being the most costly, and availability of funding and co-production opportunities.</para>

Some related production facilities may also have to be declared to the OPCW. Australia complies with OPCW declaration and verification requirements. The OPCW does not conduct inspections of facilities/entities that receive, distribute or use such chemicals.</para>

<para>CSIRO advises that this is very early stage research. Dr Barnard’s study was theoretical and only considered titanium dioxide nanoparticles.

<para>The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is continually assessing the risks of these products and has been working with its overseas counterparts and international organisations to address emerging issues. The TGA has concluded that the current weight of evidence remains that titanium dioxide and zinc nanoparticles do not penetrate the skin, and as such there is no current basis for regulatory action. In addition, the TGA has advised that Dr Barnard’s theoretical study was predicated on a number of assumptions that do not necessarily reflect real life situations or actual product formulations. Importantly, the findings assume nanoparticles are able to reach viable cells and this has not been demonstrated.</para>

<para>The trade balance (goods and services) with the United States in calendar year 2004 was a deficit of $13.5 billion.

<para>        Free trade agreements (FTA) are but one of a range of factors relevant to trade flows. Exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the prevailing economic and climatic conditions in the FTA parties and third countries, can all have an effect on the balance of trade.

Trade with the United States has grown in the period since the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement entered into force.  Total two-way goods and services trade has increased from $41.1 billion in calendar year 2004 to $53.1 billion in financial year 2008-09.</para>

<para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) has only ever received one application since 1996 to list a low-dose contraceptive. This was considered at the PBAC meeting of December 1998. The PBAC recommended that Microgynon 20® (ethinyloestradiol with levonorgestrel) be made available as a pharmaceutical benefit. However, there was subsequently no agreement on a mutually acceptable price with the manufacturer and so the product was not made available as a pharmaceutical benefit.</para>
<para>In March 2004, consistent with an agreement with the pharmaceutical industry regarding recommendations more than five years old that have not been implemented, the PBAC rescinded the recommendation for listing.</para>

<item label="(3)">
<para>Yes. Hair loss or alopecia has long been recognised as a potential side effect from use of oral contraceptives, particularly with use of the older style products. The prescribing information for health professionals for nearly all older style products contains information on this potential side effect.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Medicines are listed on the PBS on the advice of an independent, expert advisory body, the PBAC, which is comprised of doctors, other health professionals and a consumer representative. The PBAC considers applications from companies for PBS listing having regard to the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (value-for-money) of medicines, in comparison with other available treatments.</para>
<para>Companies cannot be compelled to apply for PBS listing, but the PBAC will accept a submission at any time.</para>
