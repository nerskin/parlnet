<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question, because it goes to the government’s proposal to introduce a resource super profits tax. The reason the government is proposing to do that is that we need to do three things: (1) provide proper super for working families across Australia (2) provide tax cuts for all businesses in Australia and (3) properly fund the future infrastructure needs of Australia. These are the three reasons we are proposing this tax and doing so consistent with the advice provided by the Secretary of the Treasury in his review.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I say to the Leader of the Opposition that as he goes through project by project it would be useful for him to reflect on what others have said in the commentary in recent days about a fear campaign being run by those opposite and by some in the mining industry on the impact of this proposal. I draw his attention, for example, to the comments the other day by the former chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, David Buckingham, who described the current fear campaign as ‘utterly baseless’. I also draw his attention to those comments today in the
<inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>
from the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia.</para>
<para>It follows logically that, if you are going to impose a new tax to fund these three priorities of nation building for the future, you are going to have opposition from some of the mining companies concerned. We have outlined our tax proposal and we have outlined a consultation process with the mining industry which will go to detail, which will go to implementation and which will go to transition. We are embarked on that process and will continue it into the period ahead.</para>

<para>—When it comes to health and hospitals it seems that those opposite only have one response, which is to guffaw. But, bearing in mind that we face a Leader of the Opposition who gouged $1 billion from the public hospital system, we do understand what they have to guffaw about.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I ask the Leader of the Opposition to suspend his cynicism for just one moment and reflect on the historical significance of the health and hospitals deal which was arrived at among the states and territories in Canberra on 20 April. This was a historic reform. This is the largest change to the health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare. We know where those opposite stand in their commitment to Medicare, because in years past they tried in election after election after election to get rid of Medicare. This government introduced it and this government sustained it, despite their successive attempts to get rid of it.</para>
<para>The questions which are often asked are: ‘What is this reform about? Why are we doing it?’ Point number one is that this system of ours is at a tipping point, partly because our predecessors, when the Leader of the Opposition was health minister, ripped $1 billion out of the system. The system was underfunded and under stress. But I go to the core element—</para>

<para>—The core of this reform, when it comes down to the nuts and bolts, is this: we are going to have 1,300 more hospital beds, we are going to have 2,500 additional aged-care places, we are going to have 6,000 additional doctors, we are going to progressively introduce a four-hour waiting time target at A&amp;E and we are going to bring in a target for elective surgery to be delivered on time for 95 per cent of patients. Furthermore, if a patient cannot receive their elective surgery within the clinically recommended time, we have undertaken that they would receive free treatment at a public or private hospital to get that surgery done. Beyond that, for those suffering from mental health complaints, an additional 20,000 young people will get access to mental health services. This is the bread and butter of what we are putting forward to the Australian people.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>At the level of structural reform, this is of fundamental importance. First of all, we have brought about a nationally funded system for the first time. The primary healthcare system of Australia will be funded exclusively by the Australian government, the Australia government will be the dominant funder of the acute hospital system, and the aged-care network will be funded exclusively by the Australian government. Having a system funded nationally is one thing; having it run locally is in fact equally critical. Under these reforms local hospital networks will take on the primary role for local decisions on the delivery of these improved healthcare services for working Australians. This is an important national reform—funded nationally, run locally. For the first time the Australian government will be the dominant funder of the Australian hospital system.</para>
<para>On top of that, there will be new national standards. These standards will mean shorter waiting times in our hospitals. We have outlined with the states and the territories new arrangements for national access targets and elective surgery targets, and there will be additional investments to make these things happen on the ground. These are reforms which mean things to working families across the country. Of course, when we began this debate in this parliament some years ago, it was about ending the blame game between the states and the Commonwealth. Those opposite scoffed at the possibility of any such agreement ever being reached. This government has delivered that agreement. It goes to the heart of cost shift, blame shift between the two levels of government. With the Australian government now being the exclusive funder of the primary system, the dominant funder of the acute system and the exclusive funder of the aged-care system, the financial incentives which have existed for decades and decades to shift patients from one system to another are removed. That is why this is a historic reform.</para>
<para>However, the rubber hits the road when we talk about what happens for the individual communities around Australia—for the 764 local public hospitals of Australia—and what it means, for example, for the people of Blacktown, who already in their local hospital have had 19 additional subacute beds added since the announcement of the government’s decision the other day. There is the addition of further investments for accident and emergency departments, the needs of Cairns Base Hospital and the new cancer treatment services at Townsville Base Hospital, Rockhampton, Gosford and Tamworth—all across the country. Also, there are the further investments that we are making in the expansion of services in hospitals in Darwin, Hobart and Launceston. These are not just structural reforms; they are bread and butter reforms. They are bread and butter reforms to make a difference for working families on the ground right across Australia—for pensioners and carers who have not been able to get decent access to the system so far. This is a fundamental reform. The Leader of the Opposition stood up four or five years ago as health minister and said it was time for the Commonwealth to bring about a fundamental reform to the system. For five years he failed to act; in two years this government has acted.</para>

<para>—As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be aware, the resources regime in this country deals with non-renewable resources which are taxed separately, and it has been done so for more than 100 years, either through (a) the royalties regimes of states (b) the petroleum resource rent tax or (c) proposed with this resource rent tax for onshore resources as well. That is why it is taxed separately, and I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition and the deputy would have known that.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question. I would draw the House’s attention to developments in the international economy and specifically in global financial markets over the last several weeks, particularly as they have related to Greece and, most recently and more broadly, across Europe. These have been grave and concerning developments for all those concerned with the stability of our financial markets. Developments in Europe have been of great concern to the International Monetary Fund, they have been of concern to the World Bank and they have been of concern to the whole raft of financial institutions, not least of which are the European Central Bank and the European Union. The reason for that is always the risk of contagion from one financial market to another in times of great financial instability. That is why we have been watching developments in Europe particularly closely, including over the course of the last weekend.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The statement by European finance ministers under the chairmanship of the current chair of the European community was a critical statement containing a package of stabilisation measures which are of direct relevance to credit markets and financial markets in this country. It underlines the absolute importance, therefore, of maintaining Australia’s position as one of the strongest economies in the advanced world. We have the strongest growth compared with all of the major advanced economies. We have the second-lowest unemployment, the lowest debt and the lowest deficit and we are the only country to have avoided recession—and all the time while maintaining this country’s AAA credit rating. To build on this strength for the future, what we need to do is also deal with three core challenges for the future: (1) the challenge to secure our recovery through the full implementation of stimulus (2) the challenge to keep our public finances strong through a responsible budget and (3) the challenge to reform our economy for the future by continuing a program of productivity based reform for the future.</para>
<para>When it comes to securing the recovery, I notice that those opposite call for an immediate abolition of all stimulus. This is completely contrary to the advice of any and every international financial institution. Their argument is that the global recovery is too insecure as of yet to pull the rug from underneath it. Treasury’s advice is that the government stimulus package has protected more than 200,000 jobs. Secondly, our challenge for the future is to keep our public finances strong, and this, of course, is something of which turmoil in Europe has reminded us. The stimulus strategy that we have implemented peaked at the end of the second quarter last year. In the budget last year we articulated tough fiscal rules to guide and return this budget to surplus. Those rules have been adhered to meticulously since that time, and will be into the future. This budget will not be a pre-election Liberal Party style spend-a-thon; this budget will be a no-frills, fiscally responsible budget to demonstrate responsible economic leadership.</para>
<para>Also the challenge for the future is to continue the process of reform, and questions have already come in this place about the nature of taxation reform. I draw the attention of those opposite to the fundamental need to ensure that we have for Australia an adequate pool of retirement savings for the long-term future. One of the great enduring reforms of the previous Labor government was to introduce the superannuation guarantee. It rose, against the opposition of those opposite, from three per cent to six per cent to nine per cent, and for 12 years they did nothing further about it. This government has resolved to raise the SGL from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This is not just a reform for working families; it is also a reform to boost our level of national savings.</para>
<para>In the midst of the most recent financial crisis, I remind those opposite of one core fact: the accumulation of our pool of national savings was absolutely critical for Australian companies to draw upon in their own capital raisings when capital markets froze around the world. My advice is that, during the course of last year, $90 billion to $100 billion was raised domestically onshore drawing from this pool of savings. These reforms will add up to an extra $108,000 on retirement super for an average worker aged 30 now. Critically, in aggregate it adds a further $85 billion to our pool of national savings.</para>
<para>Furthermore, the rationale for reform for the future is to bring down the company tax rate for the future as well, to make sure that our company tax rate is globally competitive, which is why the reforms we are putting forward on the basis of the tax plan advanced by the Treasurer is to bring the tax rate down to 28c with the object of heading further as public finance resources permit—an additional benefit for small business. This government has become the friend of small business. This government has put forward a tax package for small business, involving the immediate write-off—</para>

<para>—I thought that would get them going, and it did!—of the $5,000 tax break affecting 2.4 million small businesses and, for the 30 per cent of small businesses that are incorporated, in addition to that the reduction of their rate to 28c. That is the second arm of reform.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The third is the long-term funding of infrastructure. Those opposite say: ‘Where do we fund our railroad and ports? Where do we ensure that the key economic infrastructure of Australia is funded and laid out to underpin the next level of economic growth for Australia?’ What we are doing through this tax reform is building a $5.6 billion national investment fund for the infrastructure needs of the states, in particular the resource states. So what we are proposing, to take the current strength of this economy further, is, first and foremost, bringing down the tax rate for all companies, in particular to provide a tax break for small business; second, boosting the retirement income savings of all working Australians; and, third, funding the future infrastructure needs for our roads, rail and ports for the future—building on the strength we currently have, setting up Australia for long-term strong economic growth.</para>

I refer the Prime Minister to comments of his resources minister, who last week said the government’s great big new tax on mining would cause the resource companies to review their investment plans given that these projects were ‘finely balanced’.

<para>—I thank the Minister for Resources and Energy for his sterling work in recent days in working with a mining industry which is comprised of miners who want to get on with the business of their work. There are a number of them out there who have been making a range of public statements, some of which have been true and others not. As I said in response to the question asked before on the implementation of the government’s new proposed Resource Super Profits Tax, we are engaged in a process of consultation with the mining industry, as I said before, and as I have said before in Perth and elsewhere, on the detail of, the implementation of and the transition to these arrangements. That is what we intend to do. We are currently in the process, through the minister and through the Treasurer, of doing so with a large number of companies right across Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would also say to the member for Groom, who has just asked this question, that he should pay very close attention to the submission given to the Henry review by the head of the mining industry council himself when he recommended a resource rent tax for the future. It is interesting to see how things change once action is taken in order to bring about fundamental tax reform. I noticed in particular that the member for Groom has not referred to the measures contained in the government’s tax reform proposal to assist the exploration industry—$1.1 billion of additional assistance. I noticed also that the member for Groom did not draw attention to the fact that we are also assisting smaller to medium miners who may not be bringing in profits in their initial years of operation. I would draw the member for Groom’s attention to the modelling done independently through Econtech for the Treasury in producing this set of reforms. For the mining industry it is projected that this will result in an overall growth in the industry of some 6.5 per cent. Those opposite do not care about these individual elements of reform. Consistent with so many other things they do in this place, they are first and foremost about a fear campaign devoid of fact. We intend to get on with the business of reform, and reform which does three things: provides super savings for working Australians—all of them; secondly, provides tax breaks for corporate Australia, including small business; and, thirdly, provides support for investment in our long-term infrastructure needs. These are the three driving elements of the reform, broadening the base of the mining industry through a series of changes which we have reflected on carefully based on submissions from the mining industry as well. We intend to get on with it.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Makin for his question. Clearly from the Australian government’s point of view, and I might say from the point of view of the non-renewables sector of the Australian economy, the time has come for fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system when it comes to the petroleum and mining industry in Australia. That is not just the view of the Australian government; it is also the view of the Minerals Council of Australia in its submission to the Henry review. When it comes to tough decisions and fundamental reform which goes to where Australia goes in the 21st century, the government is prepared to make the hard decisions. The opposition is never prepared to meet us halfway. Having said that, the Australian government understands that this is a complex issue. For those reasons we are committed to not only putting in place a genuine process of consultation but also in engaging in open consultation to make sure we get the system right.</para>

<para>—Exploration and development in the oil and gas industries have flourished under that system. That is the very tax that brought to Australia the $12 billion Pluto petroleum investment in 2007 and the $43 billion petroleum investment in Gorgon by the joint venture partners in 2009. Compare that with the inconsistencies that exist at a state and territory level when it comes to mining and resources in Australia. There are complex arrangements with no consistency across state and territory boundaries. If you have any doubts about that, just think about the coalmining industry in New South Wales and Queensland. The systems of coal royalties are different and complex. I also remind you, Mr Speaker, that both those state governments have increased coal royalties over the last 12 months. But that is no different from the state of Western Australia, where we have in place a coalition Premier and where we have yet another variable royalty system. We should also appreciate that in many ways the Western Australian Premier actually supports the endeavours of the Australian government to front up with some hard decisions when it comes to royalties. On 25 February of this year the Western Australian Premier said:</para>

<para class="block">It is for that very reason that in the forthcoming Western Australian budget that will be brought down next week the Western Australian government is going to rip out of two major iron ore companies an increase in iron ore royalties of the order of $300 million. We will put in place a new tax regime which creates certainty and a proper investment horizon for the resources sector in Australia. But, perhaps more importantly, we will be investing in things with part of the proceeds of that new tax regime that the previous government absolutely failed to invest in.</para>
<para>First, let us go to the issue of infrastructure. Over the previous decade, because of lack of action by the Howard government, we lived off the back of increases in resource commodity prices whilst we lost market share because the Howard government failed to invest in infrastructure. A key part of the Australian government’s proposal will be to establish for the first time ever, through a budget process, a resource infrastructure fund aimed at working with state and territory governments and, I might say, the private sector to actually bring forward resource infrastructure investment, which has held back the expansion of the industry in the past. I would also say that the resources sector, like the rest of the Australian business community, will benefit from a reduction in corporate taxation.</para>
<para>But then we go to the issue of exploration, something that I am sure the member for Groom is vitally interested in because he, like other resources ministers, sought on a number of occasions, during the 12 long years of the Howard government, to put in place resource exploration incentives to encourage brownfields and greenfields exploration in Australia. For the first time ever we will be putting in place a new resource exploration rebate that benefits small preprofit exploration companies.</para>

I accept that our responsibility is to actually get the balance right between promoting investment in the mining sector and ensuring a fair return to the Australian community for the development of their resources. It is a privilege for these mining companies to actually be able to develop our resources. All the Australian community expects is a fair return for the development of those resources. We have consulted and we will continue to consult to actually get the finer detail of this proposal right for the purposes of guaranteeing Australia’s economic future.</para>

<para>—I know that the Leader of the Opposition has no interest in economics; he has said so. I know that the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, said he could never have him as a Treasurer because he has no interest in economics. But I will ask him to focus on one core concept, which is this: a tax based on volume in the resources sector penalises those firms which do not generate profits in their early years and throttles the long-term development of the industry. That is why we are moving to a profits based tax. That is why, for example, the work done a quarter of a century ago on the petroleum resource rent tax was right, because in the period since then we have seen the phenomenal growth of our offshore developments. That is the reason we have done this. It is good intrinsically for the long-term development of the industry because the tax regime changes the architecture to one which is profit based and not volume based. Secondly, as I said before in relation to companies, we will also of course be consulting the state governments on detail, on implementation and on transition and my advice from the Treasurer is that those consultations are proceeding well.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Blair for his question. Members of the House would be well aware that global prices for Australia’s commodities, Australia’s resources, have soared in recent years and that, after a dip during the global financial crisis, those prices have returned to record levels and are expected to be at very high levels for some years to come. As a result of that, the proportion of the returns that the Australian community, the owners of those resources, get from the sale of those resources has dropped significantly. It is critical to note that these resources are non-renewable; they can only be sold once. A tonne of coal or a tonne of iron ore, once it is extracted and sold, cannot be sold again. The mining boom has also been putting pressure on other sectors of the economy. It inevitably draws labour and capital from other sectors and increases prices for labour in particular, thereby generating higher costs for other sectors. It puts upward pressure on the Australian dollar, which in turn puts pressure on other sectors like tourism and manufacturing, and of course it increases the cost to governments, both state and federal, due to the provision costs of infrastructure and skills.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last week the Australian government announced a new taxation regime with respect to resources, a resource superprofits tax. It is designed to impact on profits above a basic return on capital and is similar to the petroleum resource rent tax, which has been in place for 25 years. It is a more efficient regime than royalties which tax volume and which tax production. It is a more efficient regime of taxation because it taxes profits and therefore gets a genuine return to the Australian community, the owners of these resources, in return for the exploitation of these resources. Independent economic modelling by KPMG Econtech, which is up on their website, has indicated that in the long haul this change in taxation will improve Australia’s output, it will improve investment, it will improve jobs in the sector and it will increase our GDP by 0.7 per cent in the longer term. But there is a critical point here that the opposition need to really understand before they embark on yet another sabotage effort, yet another attempt to block reform by this government.</para>
<para>The question is: where are the proceeds from this tax reform going? The proceeds of this tax are not going to reduce the deficit and they are not going towards social spending. They are going towards wealth creation overwhelmingly through cuts in business taxes, cuts in tax on small business and cuts in tax on business generally through greater investment in superannuation as a result of cuts in tax and through greater investment in infrastructure for resource states. That is where the proceeds of the government’s Resource Super Profits Tax are headed.</para>
<para>The opposition—the party that says it is the party of small business—is proposing to stand in the way of a company tax cut for small business. It is proposing to stand right in the way of a big increase in the amount that small businesses can write off immediately for tax purposes from capital expenditures from $1,000, where it is at the moment, to $5,000. It is proposing to stand right in the way of major new investment in infrastructure in mining dominated states. It is proposing to stand right in the way of a big increase in Australia’s superannuation system which, in turn, feeds into investment in Australia’s economy.</para>

<para>—Thank you, Mr Speaker. I can correct the observation made by the member for Dunkley. The increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent does, in fact, have a significant cost to the budget of lost revenue because of increased concessionality of superannuation contributions. And guess how that cost to the budget is going to be paid? From revenue from the Resource Super Profits Tax along with a cut in tax on small business, along with a cut in company tax generally and along with a greater investment in infrastructure for resource dominated states. That is where the money is going.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In conclusion, the Australian people deserve a better return from the resources that are exploited in their name and they deserve that return being dedicated to investment in wealth creation for the long-term sustainable growth of the Australian economy. That is precisely what this government is proposing to do, and that is precisely what the opposition is trying to stop.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for his question. The government will deliver an historic boost to the retirement incomes of Australians to deal with the ageing population and to give Australians a chance for a more comfortable retirement. This is a big reform. These are the biggest reforms since the introduction of our national superannuation system in 1992—8.4 million Australians will benefit from an increase in their retirement incomes and 3.5 million Australians will pay little or no tax on their superannuation as the government effectively reduces the contributions tax for low-income earners to zero.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These are reforms of today to meet the challenges of tomorrow, and they have been very widely welcomed. The former Governor of the Reserve Bank and former Secretary to the Treasury, Bernie Fraser, had this to say. He said that he was very encouraged by that move because it will make a significant contribution to more Australians having the chance of a half decent retirement income. He said that, really, nine per cent is not sufficient for the vast majority of Australians; 12 per cent will be better. And the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales said that pensioners and superannuants welcome the Australian government’s response to the Henry review as it will make the superannuation system fairer for low-income earners and will boost retirement incomes. They said that they call on all MPs to pass on these reforms. Bernie Fraser was a Labor mate—maybe the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association are Labor mates too.</para>
<para>So we have had Bernie Fraser and we have had the superannuants. They said Bernie Fraser was a Labor mate. Let us see what that other well-known Labor mate John Brogden, the Chief Executive of the Investment and Financial Services Association, had to say about the reforms of this government. He said that the policy announced by the government eight days ago is good for Australia and good for Australians. He said that it will deliver an extraordinary benefit to the economy. He went on to say that this is a visionary policy, that it is visionary for Australians’ retirement outcomes and it is visionary for the Australian economy. He said that they support this strongly and call on the opposition to join with the government in supporting this important policy. That is that well-known Labor mate John Brogden.</para>
<para>The reason why these reforms have been so well received is that ordinary Australians stand to benefit so much from these reforms. An employee aged 30 today, on average weekly earnings, will receive an extra $108,000 when they come to retire. And a female aged 30 today, on average weekly earnings, who may have her working pattern interrupted by maternity leave and other issues, stands to gain $78,000 when she comes to retire. But the opposition opposes these important reforms and opposes this boost to the retirement incomes of Australians.</para>
<para>I have seen the opposition, and saw it again a few moments ago, arguing that there is no link between the resources super profit tax and these reforms. The shadow minister for superannuation, the member for Cowper, who is now more accurately known as the shadow minister against superannuation, has issued a press release saying there is no link, and I saw the shadow Treasurer arguing this on
<inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline>
on Sunday. Winter is coming to Canberra and it is time to get your sloppy joe out once again—because there he was, arguing on
<inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline>
that there is no link. He said there was no government money going into the superannuation guarantee. The opposition so lacks an understanding of basic economics and so lacks an understanding of public finance that it seems not to realise that superannuation in Australia attracts a tax concession, and when you increase the amount of money on superannuation you increase the cost of the tax concession. That is how it works and a half a percent increase in the superannuation guarantee sees the cost of the tax concession go up by $500 million.</para>
<para>The opposition stands against improved superannuation in two ways: it opposes the increase in the superannuation guarantee and it opposes the super profits tax on the resources sector, which will fund the improved and increased tax concessions. Now, there is something deeper going on here because the opposition, the Liberal Party, hates superannuation. It opposed superannuation when the Keating government introduced it. It opposed the increase in the superannuation guarantee all through the Howard years. It stopped Australian working families getting an improved retirement income all through the Howard years.</para>
<para>This Leader of the Opposition particularly hates superannuation. This Leader of the Opposition argued in his book
<inline font-style="italic">Battlelines</inline>
that the tax concessions for superannuation should be abolished. He would put a wrecking ball through the retirement incomes of Australians—a wrecking ball. He would abolish the tax concessions for superannuation and make Australian workers pay tax on superannuation at their full marginal tax rate. The Australian people have a very clear choice at the next election: a government which believes in promoting and boosting the retirement incomes of Australians or an opposition which stands against boosting the retirement incomes of Australians and stands against working Australians having a more comfortable retirement.</para>

The cost per square metre under the Prime Minister’s school hall program for some buildings like canteens was as high as $13,300. How does achieving potentially less than 10 per cent value in some cases fit with his promise to be a fiscal conservative?

<para>—A minister—finance minister, I recall—of the previous government, the highest taxing government in Australia’s history, providing any lecture on fiscal conservatism is remarkable. The projects concerned formed part of the government’s school modernisation program. I noticed from the tone of the question from the shadow minister for education that he is deeply disappointed by the contents of the APPA report. The APPA report has a number of observations within it, including the following: 97 per cent of principals said students would benefit from the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program; 96 per cent of students would benefit from the National School Pride Program; 90 per cent of principals agreed that the projects undertaken matched community needs; et cetera. This has been a remarkably successful program right across the country.</para>

<para>Only last week I was in the electorate of the member for Deakin, opening the new library at the School of St Luke the Evangelist. I listened very carefully to the teachers, the local priest and others talking about them having something decent added to their school for the first time in decades and decades. I also went outside and looked at what had happened via the improvement program which had funded the astroturfing of an oval that had previously been completely unusable due to there not being enough water to have grass there. For the first time, the kids can go out there and not have their knees skinned if they fall over once. These stories are being repeated across the nation in the 24,000 projects that are underway under the Building the Education Revolution program.</para>
<para>This government is proud of the school modernisation program. This government is proud of the libraries that are being built across Australia. We are proud of the fact that we are adding science centres across Australia. We are proud of the fact that we are also assisting local school communities deal with needs that have been banking up year after year. The government has looked carefully at the Audit Office’s report. The Deputy Prime Minister has taken note of its recommendations. The government will continue to implement these projects.</para>

<para>—Nonsense? I say that those opposite are walking two sides of the street. On the question of the Building the Education Revolution program, those opposite have one responsibility if they are being fair dinkum: in each electorate across the Australia, they must itemise each one of the schools at which they will cease the construction program. Otherwise, the Leader of the Opposition’s statement about halting stimulus payments across the country is revealed for what it is: a piece of utterly fraudulent politics. That is the challenge for those opposite. If you are going to say this in Canberra, do it at the local level. Every local newspaper editor will chase you down and ask which schools you will stop funding, which of those where construction has not started will you pull the plug on and how many tradies will you throw out of work.</para>

<para>I go back again to the School of St Luke the Evangelist. I spoke to the local builder, who said to me that, were it not for this program, he and so many other people who worked on it—up to 30 subbies on a given day—would have had no work last year. Why do you think that this country—unique among the major advanced economies—emerged from the global economic crisis with positive growth, as the only economy not to go into recession and as the only economy to continue to generate high levels of employment, with an unemployment level about half of what we see in Europe and the United States? The answer lies in getting on with the business of implementing stimulus projects on the ground, ones that have provided real and tangible returns for the kids of the 21st century. That is why the government unapologetically supports this program.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. I acknowledge his interest in infrastructure issues, particularly in his regional community. Australia does indeed need world-class infrastructure, especially in our resource rich states. The Rudd government is determined to manage the next resources boom better than the previous government managed the last one, making sure that we have long-lasting productivity and sustainable growth. Through the resources rent tax, we will be able to establish a $5.6 billion state infrastructure fund aimed at doing just that. This will build better road and rail infrastructure and more efficient ports. It will tackle the capacity constraints that the Reserve Bank warned on 20 separate occasions during the last boom were holding back Australia’s economic growth.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This fund is about boosting productivity across the economy. It will provide vital infrastructure reform for our economic future. It will deliver critical funds for infrastructure funding when they are most needed: as resource projects are built, not years down the track after production has come on line. But yet again we have those opposite opposing reform and opposing investment in infrastructure.</para>
<para>We know that public investment in infrastructure fell by 20 per cent as a proportion of national income during their term in office. Every time this government has attempted infrastructure reform, it has been opposed by those opposite. They opposed the establishment of Infrastructure Australia, they opposed the Building Australia Fund and they opposed the record spending through the Nation Building Program. It is not surprising when you look at what they say. The Leader of the Opposition has justified their opposition to spending when it comes to rail with this quote: ‘But normally state governments can do all that.’ That was their attitude during their period in office—it was someone else’s problem. Under their watch, super profits went up by $80 billion over the last decade, but there was a failure to invest in infrastructure. The way the government has structured this package will ensure that infrastructure is looked after, and that is in the interests of the national economy, just as Australians getting a fair share from their resources is in the interests of all Australians.</para>

They did so because they believed that the government’s resources should be dedicated in the meantime to ensuring that all safety matters arising from the previous program were properly dealt with. Furthermore, the government has already provided, by way of assistance to firms within the industry, $15 million in insulation industry assistance package support, together with arrangements with the Commissioner for Taxation on GST payment obligations for eligible insulation companies.

<para>—I particularly thank the member for Forde for that question. Of course, we have already heard from the Prime Minister about the historic COAG deal that was reached on 20 April. But the important backing-in of that agreement is made by the question asked by the member for Forde, because his electorate, which includes Logan Hospital, has already received $44 million to upgrade its emergency department. It is one of the busiest hospitals in Queensland. This comes from the $750 million that was already committed to taking pressure off emergency departments from the 2008 COAG agreement. Thirty-seven hospitals across the country are receiving upgrades. Many of them are already in fact operating. Royal Darwin Hospital, for example, is expanding its emergency department with a $2.3 million upgrade. New medical assessment units have already opened across New South Wales in hospitals, including the Calvary Mater in Newcastle and in Mona Vale and Liverpool.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What we see with the recent agreement is a $750 million additional investment in emergency departments to bring about our commitment that patients be seen, admitted or discharged within four hours—a new first-time target for the nation in emergency departments. We can look across the spectrum for this. We can look at our new investments in elective surgery—$800 million extra, as the Prime Minister mentioned, with a new guarantee to provide elective surgeries within the clinically recommended time. But of course we already had made a $600 million investment in elective surgery, which has already provided 62,000 additional elective surgeries, and more than 120 hospitals across the country have received new equipment or upgrades. Patients are already enjoying the benefits of this investment in hospitals such as Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Frankston Hospital and Canberra Hospital.</para>
<para>In fact, I am disappointed that the member for Dunkley is not here, because I was fortunate to be able to visit Frankston Hospital in just the last few weeks. They already have a new, dedicated elective surgery ward which is assisting them to deal with their throughput and the growing demand for elective surgery. I was told by the director of elective surgery at Frankston Hospital that since our investment was made and they opened that ward they have not had to cancel one elective surgery operation. This is a really important achievement for the people of Frankston, and this is going to be replicated across the country.</para>
<para>So we are very proud that the additional significant investments that will deliver for patients across the country are building on significant investments that have already been made and that are rolling out across the country. But what you can see from the new investment is not just the guarantee for elective surgery. It is not just the new access targets for emergency departments. It is more than 1,300 new subacute beds across the country. Our investments are going to support over a million extra emergency department services and more than 90,000 extra elective surgeries and will deliver an estimated 24,900 services just through the additional subacute beds. This is a lot of people. It is a lot of families. It is a lot of relief for people who are in pain and, often, suffering. We would invite those opposite to start representing their constituents. Encourage people—the member for Dunkley, I am sure, will be doing this about Frankston Hospital—to support these important investments that are delivering for patients across the country.</para>

<para>—I am advised that four years ago there were some 1,000 fewer long day care centres and child care was of course less affordable, for the reason I just referred to. Since then we have increased the childcare rebate, ABC Learning has collapsed and the government has helped re-establish the market by ensuring as many centres as possible kept their doors open. Following reassessment of the market, the data has indicated that supply is largely keeping pace with demand. The government, therefore, will remain attentive to any particular emergence of supply gaps in parts of the nation. We have, however, acted on the basis of close consultation with the industry.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Child Care Vacancies Quarterly snapshot showed that 91 per cent of reporting long day care services recorded vacancies, including 90 per cent in major cities and 98 per cent in very remote and remote areas. In light of this evidence, the government reached the decision that has been articulated by the minister in recent days. Again I would draw the honourable member’s attention to the circumstances which the Deputy Prime Minister and others had to confront following the collapse of ABC Learning. My advice or recollection is that that was about one-quarter or one-third of centres right across the nation. The fact that the government stepped in and kept that network afloat in terms of making sure that so many families out there were not left in the lurch is an extraordinary achievement in itself. That, on top of the other factors I referred to, goes to the whole range of provision of centres across the country, the vacancy snapshots that we referred to—the basis, therefore, for the government’s decision.</para>
<para>Finally, on the affordability question, I believe it speaks for itself—a 30 per cent to 50 per cent increase in the childcare rebate up to a threshold of $7,500 per child per year, a significant pre-election commitment by this government which we have honoured in full because working families need access to affordable child care.</para>

<para>—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his enthusiasm as well. The House may be pleased to hear that today in classrooms around the nation more than a million children are sitting down to do the first day of the national tests—children in grades 3, 5, 7 and 9 right around the country starting today, the first day of national testing. Of course national testing continues today, tomorrow and the next day, and children will be tested in sequence on writing, on reading and on numeracy skills. This is important for the individual children involved because it will lead to them and their parents having an individual report card about how that child is going against the benchmarks of the nation and national standards. I understand—and indeed I have met with some schoolchildren today who sat the national test—that going to school and doing tests is not necessarily fun for kids. Some of the kids said the test was fun. A few of the kids said they were a little bit scared. But it is important that children sit these tests and get that report card for mum and dad.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is also important that their teachers end up with the information from what is a world-leading diagnostic tool. It is a world-leading diagnostic tool that enables their teachers to then work through what it is that can be done to best promote that child’s individual learning in areas that the test has examined in that child’s education. This information is vital for the next version of the My School website, which will be available by the end of the year.</para>
<para>As members would know, and people listening would know, the Australian Education Union had at one point contemplated a boycott of the national tests. I am very pleased that the Australian Education Union did not pursue that boycott and the national tests are going ahead today without any threat of disruption. In terms of that threat of a boycott, can I assure members of the House that everything on the My School website will stay and it will be updated with the 2010 test information. We will also be adding additional information to My School including, importantly, the amount of funding going in per school, and we will be able to add value-added measures. Because we are now in the third year of national testing, we will be able to show the journey of children in the two years of learning since they were last tested.</para>
<para>One would have thought that this was unambiguously a good news story that would be celebrated by all members of the House. But, of course, when we come to the question of education, there is always opposition from those across the chamber. In particular, let me direct the House’s attention to the attitude of the member for Parkes. The member for Parkes, last month, said in the
<inline font-style="italic">Daily Liberal</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para>I whole-heartedly support any teacher that decides to take a stand against this discrimination by refusing to oversee the NAPLAN tests …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And, even when the Australian Education Union backed away from their plan to boycott the national tests, the member for Parkes was on 2DU, Dubbo radio, on Friday last week, saying he was disappointed that the union had called off the ban. We know that the Liberal Party does not support transparency. Barry O’Farrell has already proved that for us in New South Wales. Now we have it as a matter of record that members opposite do not support transparency.</para>
<para>This is a website that the shadow minister has referred to as a white elephant. Well, let me say very directly to members opposite: Australian parents believe you are wrong. This website has been visited by Australian parents in record numbers, recording over three million visitors. On this side of the House, we will get on with the job of delivering an education revolution, as parents want to see it after 12 long years of neglect. Over there they are opposed to My School, opposed to Building the Education Revolution, opposed to Computers in Schools, opposed to lifting teacher quality, opposed to literacy and numeracy, opposed to more money for disadvantaged schools—actually, opposed to everything parents want in this country for their children’s education.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his 2007 promise to be tougher on border protection. Since he made that commitment no boats have been turned around, there have been record numbers of illegal boat arrivals, the Christmas Island detention centre is full, people arriving illegally are now regularly transferred to the mainland and the Curtin detention centre is set to reopen. Given his broken promise, why should Australians concerned about the security of our borders believe any new promises he makes in this election year?</para>

<para>—I welcome the contribution to the debate today by the member for Cook. Just a few facts: the three years with the largest number of asylum seekers over the last 15 years were under the Howard government—1999, 2000 and 2001. The highest number of boats in any one year arriving in Australia was under the Howard government, in 1999. The largest number of asylum seekers in one year was under the Howard government, in 2001. The single-largest vessel to arrive in Australia was under the Howard government, with 359 people. So let us just put all that into a bit of context.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Secondly, what I would say in response to the member for Cook is as follows. He referred to asylum seekers who are in various processing centres on the mainland. He has been contributing to this debate in recent days. In fact, he was on 2GB—I presume—where he said the following:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Now, it is not for the first time this has happened—</para>

<para class="block">He is referring to people being processed onshore and being accommodated temporarily in some form of hotel or motel accommodation. He said:</para>

<para class="block">I should be upfront with the people about this, Ray—</para>

<para class="block">I presume that is Ray Hadley—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">when there was that massive surge of arrivals that occurred back in 1999,2000 and 2001, we had to do that when we were in government for that very brief period of time.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The problem is, as he knows, they kept doing it. It did not stop in 1999; it did not stop in 2000. It went on to 2001. And here are the facts: in 2004-05—this is what the member for Cook neglected to tell Ray Hadley this morning—the Howard government budgeted $1.8 million for community and hotel based detention. That was in 2004-05. Then in 2004 the Howard government was spending approximately $80,000 a month to house two asylum seekers at the Arkaba Hotel in Adelaide. I hope it was a nice hotel! What the member for Cook neglected, I am sure, to tell 2GB this morning was that, in December 2006, under the Howard government there were something like 20 or 30 detainees living in private hotels and serviced apartments and 57 detainees living in residential housing. Hotels like the Comfort Asti Inn in Darwin, the Colonel in Brisbane—</para>

That goes to a debate in which he has also been participating, which is how they are being accommodated. This morning on national radio he did not tell the truth. That is the bottom line: he fundamentally misled the Australian public. He said that this practice was only in emergency times, finishing in 2001. He has been found out today to be an absolute political fraud, because this practice was pursued under the Howard government in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.</para>

<para>—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. To assist the House I will withdraw. The member for Cook just said in his remarks then, ‘I told the truth.’ Can I ask the House to form their own independent judgement of the following. This morning on radio he said: ‘I should be upfront with people about that, Ray. When there was that massive surge of arrivals that occurred back in 1999, 2000 and 2001 we had to do that’—that is, accommodate people in hotels—‘when we were in government, for a brief period of time.’ What we now know from the facts is that this practice continued extensively in 2004, 2005 2006 and 2007. I would submit to the House that on any reasonable person’s reading this, in fact, was not a truthful statement.</para>

<para>The reason I highlight this point in this debate on asylum seekers is that it goes to the heart of the truthfulness in which they engage in this debate around the country right now, which is entirely fear based—a debate around the country which is designed to instil fear and intimidation in the community.</para>

<para>I am really pleased to advise the House that we now find ourselves at crunch time in terms of Australia’s efforts to host the 2018 or 2022 FIFA World Cup, with our bid being formalised this week. On Friday in Zurich, Australia will not only lodge the official World Cup bid book but also have the opportunity to provide our first presentation to the FIFA executive committee on the case for why Australia is the best place in the world to host this enormous sporting event.</para>
<para>I can inform the House of another milestone in the bidding process, where just recently we have seen the successful completion of a memorandum of understanding between the Australian government, the AFL, Cricket Australia, the ARU, the NRL and the FFA in respect of this bid. This agreement covers a number of areas and includes costs associated with any code displacement, a guarantee for seasons continuity and an agreement to minimise the disruption to any other of our Australian codes.</para>
<para>It has previously been noted internationally that one of the real strengths of the Australian bid has been the bipartisan political support and the support at the level of the Australian government as well as from our state and territory governments. But, on top of this, the completion of the MOU in the past week is a clear indication that this bid is also supported by a united sporting community. I would like to acknowledge the efforts and contributions of all those who were involved in the negotiations and thank the leaders of Australian sport for getting behind this important bid.</para>
<para>Whilst now the very hard work begins, this is a pivotal time in the bid process, and it shows that a huge amount has already been achieved. The bid has been finalised, our pitch has been prepared, negotiations have been conducted between the state and territory governments, understandings have been reached with the major Australian sports and the case has been finalised for bringing the World Cup to Australia. I have noted the opposition’s support, and I note the Leader of the Opposition once more in stating that we are very clearly saying to the international community that both sides of Australian politics are very much behind that.</para>
<para>All this would not have been achieved if it were not for the hard work and determination of Frank Lowy and the FFA, the cooperation of other sports, commitments from our state and territory governments and also the dedicated efforts of people like Jeff Dixon and Ron Harvey, who have been assisting in negotiations. I take this opportunity to thank our tireless World Cup task force led by Richard Eccles, all of whom I commend to the House, because now we get to the business end of this: the lobbying and convincing the world that there is no better place than right here in Australia. We are absolutely in this to win it, and that is the message that Australia will send very clearly both when we present in Zurich on Friday and also constantly until the decision is made in December.</para>
<para>Whilst on the topic of the bid, I would like to very quickly congratulate the boys who were named earlier today in the Socceroos team to play in South Africa in just a few weeks time. This, of course, is an enormous honour, and I know that we all wish them all very best for a strong preparation. I would like to reiterate to all sports lovers in Australia and the international football movement that Australia is very, very serious in this endeavour. We are in it to win it. We know that there is no better place on the planet to host major sporting events, and we will absolutely be going all out to convince the rest of the world of that.</para>

<para>—All honourable members would be familiar with the impact of drought. Many members would not be familiar with some of the impacts which happen following welcomed rain. Many of our farmers throughout Australia have been dealing with that in previous months. When I was given this job, one of my first visits was to the Plague Locust Commission at Broken Hill, where I was told that the locust problem was not so much of a problem because of the extent of drought that we had at the time but that, once rains came, it would provide a breeding ground and we could well find ourselves hit by a particularly severe plague of locusts throughout the agricultural areas along the east coast. That is precisely what happened.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In March the Plague Locust Commission was involved in aerial spraying in an area around Tibooburra—some 200,000 hectares in all. Notwithstanding that fairly major effort, there was breeding to capacity in an area around Balranald which then followed the warm weather systems, through the Riverina and into South Australia and Victoria. We are looking at damage in the order of—and there are different estimates of this—$40 million. I want to acknowledge the members of parliament from each side of the House who have been in contact with me over the break to provide me with information as to what was happening on the ground and to make sure that their concerns were being fed back to the Plague Locust Commission and its work.</para>
<para>For those not familiar, we are talking about something like a dark storm cloud hovering about four metres above a paddock that takes out absolutely everything. The challenge that we have had may well be nothing to the challenge that is ahead of us. The plague that we have seen has now largely left its eggs in the ground. You get a very brief window in the nymph stage when spraying can do something about the next infestation. It is expected that the nymph stage will arrive in late September to mid-October, precisely the time that many of these areas will be looking at harvest, and then we will be faced with very real problems if they do undergo spraying: what that means to the value of crops and whether the residue limits are hit.</para>
<para>With that in mind, we are expecting to increase our funding by around 15 per cent at our end—that is, for the joint funding for the Plague Locust Commission. The first line of defence, when it comes to spraying at the nymph stage later this year, will be the farmers themselves, as is always the case. I would encourage any farmers to make contact with the Australian Plague Locust Commission on the toll-free number: 1800635962. While droughts, floods and fires always receive the most publicity, in terms of economic damage there is a very real risk to the harvest later this year as a result of the eggs already in the ground. I would encourage members of parliament to continue to be in touch with producers in their regions to try to make sure that the targeted effort required later this year takes place.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">I wish to make some brief remarks about item 16 of the list of documents to be tabled, the
<inline font-style="italic">International piracy and armed robbery at sea security inquiry report</inline>. I made a statement to the House in June 2009 to advise members that I asked the Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Mick Palmer, to undertake a comprehensive inquiry into maritime piracy and armed robbery at sea as it affects Australia and to identify ways in which security arrangements could be further improved. The inspector has completed his report, which he formally presented to me on 22 April 2010. During the course of the inquiry the inspector developed counterpiracy and armed robbery at sea security advisory guidelines for the Australian shipping industry which I launched at the International Maritime Organisation General Assembly in London in December 2009. The guidelines detail preventative measures recommended to help detect, deter and prevent piracy and armed robbery at sea.</para>
<para>The final report contains five recommendations. The first recommendation is that the preventative measures contained in the advisory guidelines should be considered for adoption by ship operators, masters and owners. The second recommendation is that Australian security regulated ships undertaking international voyages as part of normal business activity should re-evaluate current security plans. The third recommendation is that consideration should be given to identifying a federal government agency to be the single or primary coordination point between the shipping industry and government on piracy. The fourth recommendation is that the government work with the shipping industry and maritime unions to facilitate a review of current seafarer welfare support practices and arrangements. The final recommendation is that current ship security planning arrangements should be reviewed to ensure that both safety and security issues are jointly applied to the security planning process. The continuing threat of piracy and armed robbery at sea will require shipping owners and operators to maintain a constant level of preparedness and awareness of the threat posed to them and to consistently update their knowledge of appropriate preventative measures and industry best practice.</para>
<para>The piracy inquiry report will assist industry in this process and I congratulate the Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Mick Palmer, and his team for the hard work they have done on this report, which has been internationally recognised as being groundbreaking in its depth, in its research and in its recommendations. Indeed, members of Mr Palmer’s team travelled to Nairobi in Kenya and have provided practical on-the-ground assistance, which I am sure every member of this parliament would agree has given great credit to us as a nation. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>—This resource super tax will hurt all Australians. It will not just hurt those who work in the mining industry; it will not just hurt those who work in the industries that support the mining industry; it will not just hurt those people who rely on income from the mining industry through shares or superannuation. Its tentacles reach into every household in Australia. It will produce higher power bills. It will produce higher house prices because bricks and mortar and sand and gravel will all be affected by this tax. It will increase fertiliser prices for farmers who grow the food for this nation and earn export income. As observed by a journalist in one of this morning’s newspapers, ‘The RSPT actually stands for a really stupid political tax.’ And that is what this is: this is a stupid political tax grab by a government that has lost complete control of its budget, has lost complete control of its debt and has completely lost its vision for the future of this country. The mining industry has been delivered a sledgehammer blow by a government that only thinks in 24-hour spin media cycles and does not think of the impact that this tax is going to have on the future investment in Australian mining, the jobs that that creates and the impact of making Australia’s mining industry so uncompetitive that miners will simply base their new operations overseas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am not suggesting there are going to be widespread mine closures in Australia. There is going to be a continuation of those mines, but as most people who understand the mining industry know—and probably the only two people in the government who do are sitting opposite me: the minister for resources and the member for Brand—mines have finite lives. Mines close; other mines open. Miners move from one mine to the next, often only a few kilometres, sometimes hundreds of kilometres, sometimes interstate. The new mines that replace the old mines will, under this tax, be located in Canada, in Brazil, in Peru, in Chile, in Indonesia and in Africa—everywhere else has a lower tax on its mining than Australia as a result of this tax.</para>
<para>The resource industry in Australia has protected us and our economy through many ups and downs and it is Australia’s largest export earner. This year it is estimated it will earn $150 billion in export earnings. It is already paying above the norm in terms of taxes. It is paying somewhere between 37 and 43 per cent—about 40 per cent—in government taxes already. It represents eight per cent of the economy over the last decade and yet pays 18 per cent of the company tax. Yet we have a Prime Minister who has the audacity to say that these people are raping the profits out of Australia and taking them back to their homelands. Most of the companies that operate in Australia either have Australian shareholders or have in fact in the last five years invested more money here than they have taken away. This just highlights the fact that the Prime Minister knows nothing about this industry. He certainly does not understand that Australia was built on a philosophy that, if you invested money and took a risk, you did not ever get an assurance that you would get a return, but if you did then you were entitled to make a profit. This Prime Minister belittles people who make profits. He belittles people who are successful in their own right. He belittles people who are millionaires, and on one or two occasions billionaires, as a result of their own risks and their own efforts.</para>
<para>We have a Prime Minister who demonises foreign ownership, who pulls out the racist card against foreign companies and says that they are not welcome here. That is xenophobia. Foreign investment built this country—it made this country what it is today, along with the blood, sweat and toil of farmers, miners and people in the city going about their day-to-day work. Yet this government, this Prime Minister, has chosen to single out one industry and say, ‘You are already paying 40 per cent tax when the company tax rate is 30 per cent, but we are going to make you pay 57 per cent tax’. In some cases it will be 80 per cent of their profits because the parameters of this super tax are not the same as they are for the petroleum resource rent tax; they are not based on allowing companies to deduct all their costs, particularly in terms of how they deal with those costs. It is a super super tax—a tax that will simply drive investment overseas.</para>
<para>This issue is not just about the future of the mining industry; it is about the future of the jobs of the people who work in it. It is not just about the future of the miners, the men and women who go down these dark holes and drive heavy machinery in open cuts; it is about the men and women who work in the fabrication shops, in the engineering works, in the air-conditioned offices across this country, in Sydney, in Melbourne, in Perth and in Brisbane—the people whose livelihood is linked directly and quite unashamedly to the mining industry and the risks it takes. And it is about the people that they employ—the gardener who works in their gardens when they are at work or the cleaner who assists them in cleaning up the office after work. All these people will be affected by this super tax. It will flow through and affect every city and town in Australia, and particularly it will hurt the regional towns—country towns like Cloncurry, which had a $30 million project cancelled yesterday; Karratha, which in time could see the investment that is going on there at the moment suddenly shift to a new focus; and Ballarat and Parkes. These are towns that rely on significant income from their mining industries. One in eight Queenslanders is employed by the mining industry. We wonder about their future in regional Australia.</para>
<para>This is also about people who have already done their toil for this country and have invested their retirement moneys in stocks and shares or in superannuation funds that are now being decimated by the news of this super tax and the effect that it will potentially have on the country’s resource industry. We saw figures released this week that around 9.3 per cent of Australia’s superannuation is invested in resource industry stock. At the close of trading on Monday, 10 May, yesterday, Australians had lost around $13.4 billion in superannuation earnings and capital in superannuation funds as a result of the fall in stocks.</para>
<para>Abraham Lincoln, that fantastic American statesman and leader—the Prime Minister should look to him at times to see what a leader is—said that you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. Yet this government is happy to weaken the strong. It is happy to do anything that will prop up its excessive spending, its excessive debt and its inability to manage money. I want to quote from people who do not have a political interest in this debate. The
<inline font-style="italic">Globe</inline>, a Canadian publication, has said that as a result of this tax:</para>
<quote>
<para>Mining company shares, particularly those with operations in Australia, were roundly pummelled …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Another quote pertinent to this debate states:</para>
<quote>
<para>Slowing down the development of Australia’s mining and energy resource industries would be a scandalous wasted opportunity to lock in future prosperity and achieve social and environmental goals such as supporting school students in disadvantaged communities, Australians with disabilities, those with mental illnesses and others who are too sick to work, and preserving Australia’s unique biological diversity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Who said that? A member of the government—a minister, the member for Rankin, said that not very long ago. I wonder what he says today. I wonder whether he has had that thought purged from his mind. Let us go back to what this is doing to Australia. A Southern Cross Equities publication states:</para>
<quote>

The red crosses on the document that I am holding up are the things that are not similar.</para>
<para>We have to do something about this tax. We on this side of the House are going to stop this tax, not for our political gain but because of what is in this document I am holding: this is Australia, second only to America at the moment; we are going to move to here, 58 per cent. What has our largest competitor, Canada, got in terms of company taxes and resource taxes? Twenty three per cent.

<para>—Firstly, I welcome the member for Groom back to the portfolio. I must say he was very disappointed at being moved out of the portfolio after backing the wrong horse in the leadership challenge of last December. Seriously, I appreciate the opportunity to address what are very serious issues before the chair. I note that the letter from the member for Groom which led to this matter of public importance debate goes to, namely:</para>

<para class="block">For that reason, let me go firstly to a page of the government document which was released last Sunday week and is entitled
<inline font-style="italic">Tax policy statement: Stronger. Fairer. Simpler. A tax plan for the future</inline>. I take the member for Groom directly to page 13. I will quote from it, because this is important as it goes to the heart of the very issue raised by the member for Groom. It says:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">which effectively removes royalties and cutting the company tax rate by 2 percentage points, is a long run improvement to GDP of 0.7 per cent.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That goes to the crux of this debate. I also appreciate that it is going to be a long, tough tax debate because reform in Australia has never come easy to the Australian community or to this parliament. I have been through a number of very tough debates—some of which are still part of the proposal before the House today—be they on tax, superannuation, infrastructure or a variety of issues in a variety of forms throughout my political and industrial careers.</para>
<para>For those reasons I also remind the House that the Minerals Council of Australia has actually argued itself:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is a strong argument to reform the basis of determining royalty payments to a profits based criteria from a revenue one.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I could not agree more with the Minerals Council of Australia. But I also appreciate that the devil is in the detail, and that is where we are really at at the moment. The Commonwealth government has announced its intentions with respect to its headline commitment, which is what it believes is a fair return to the Australian community for the opportunity by companies to actually develop our natural resources and, in doing so, gain a fair return for shareholders who invest in those companies. For those reasons we have established a proper public process to enable the individual companies who employ people in Australia to model the government proposal and to open their books to enable us to assess some of the implementation difficulties announced by the Treasurer only last Sunday week. The resources tax consultation panel is led by David Parker of Treasury. I am also aware that since we announced it a number of companies have been—not once but on a number of occasions—to Treasury and to those involved in that consultation process to go through the detail of the government’s proposal. I also note, for the interest of the House, that some companies who have criticised the tax plan have done so before they have actually modelled it themselves, which they have admitted in private discussions with me, and before they have even registered for the consultation process. So I simply say to those companies that you cannot negotiate through the media, that tax is not easy and that they should take the time and do the modelling and sit down with the tax consultation panel for the purposes of informing both themselves and us about any complications arising from this proposal. I say that because in every reform proposal there is actually room for negotiations around the detail. I also say that for those reasons the panel has been told in no uncertain terms that its responsibility is to run the ruler over the new proposal project by project to assess, through a proper consultation process, how you actually get the finer detail right.</para>
<para>I also want to make it very clear that, from the government’s point of view, it is time for tax reform in the non-renewable sector of the Australian resources industry. Yes, the resources sector is part of our future and a vital part of our economy, but resources are also owned by the whole of the Australian community. The responsibility of government is to attract investment and also to make sure that the Australian community gets a fair return for the development of its resources. That is what this debate is about. It is not a debate confined to the Commonwealth government; it is also a debate that is ongoing before state and territory governments on a regular basis.</para>
<para>Just think about what is going on at a state level at this very moment. Last week we saw the Northern Territory Treasurer in the Northern Territory budget bring down an increase in royalties of two per cent because that government considered that the people of the Northern Territory were not getting a fair return on the development of their resources. We also appreciate—and it is public knowledge—that there is going to be a change by the Western Australian government in the iron ore royalty regime for two major companies as of budget day in Western Australia. That has been suggested as being an outcome of the order of $300 million from two companies just through one hit as a result of the Western Australian budget, which will be brought down in the very near future and imposed on two major companies.</para>
<para>Having spent a fair amount of time in Western Australia over recent weeks I can assure you that there are a number of other royalty proposals in the pipeline, which were known to individual companies and sections of the Western Australian mining industry. By way of interest I note that the Premier gave an undertaking only a matter of a week to 10 days ago that, on this occasion, he would not be acting on the gold royalty for this budget but made no undertakings beyond the forthcoming Western Australian budget.</para>
<para>That takes us to why we actually have to front up to reform. I accept that there is a lot of fear in the Australian community about the process of tax reform. That same fear and scaremongering was very much part of the initiatives of the Hawke and Keating governments when they brought in the petroleum resource rent tax 25 years ago. At that time we went through a process to actually get the detail right. That petroleum resource rent tax has proven to be one of the most stable tax regimes in the world. If you have any doubts about that, as I said in question time today, just think about recent investment decisions. In 2007 there was the Pluto Woodside project of $12 billion, and then the biggest ever single investment in Australia’s history by the Gorgon joint venture partners in 2009 of $43 billion.</para>
<para>I remind you that under that system Esso and BHP have extended the life of the Bass Strait for decades. That is because we actually made sensible changes. I also say that the introduction of that tax regime has—as the Prime Minister said today in question time, ‘What we do in this sector is different to other sectors of the Australian economy’—meant for the petroleum industry a reduction in compliance costs, the removal of inconsistencies and the establishment of a consistent, simple and effective tax regime. Compare that to what I have already touched on—the inconsistencies and differences that currently exist at the state and territory level.</para>
<para>I dealt with some of these issues in question time today. Why should there be different royalty regimes between New South Wales and Queensland on the issue of coalmining? There is no good reason. Why should there be different royalty regimes amongst the states with respect to the issue of iron ore mining, which extends across a number of state and territory boundaries? The time has come for the Australian government to actually do something about rationalising the nature of the tax system relating to the non-renewable resources sector in the Australian community and, in doing so, to put in place a consistent outcome which not only gives the Australian community a fair return on the development of its resources but also creates an opportunity for the government to plough financial resources back into resolving some of the pressures that the mineral sector is creating in the broader Australian community at this very point in time.</para>
<para>As far as I am concerned, we will get through this difficult dispute around the appropriate tax take in the development of the resources sector in the Australian community. On the way through we are also setting up our future. It is not just about a short-term change in the taxation regime; it is also about creating the opportunity for the long-term development of the industry associated with ongoing private sector investment in a key part of the Australian economy.</para>
<para>That takes me to some of the Australian government initiatives. I start by reminding the member for Groom of his desire, on a number of occasions as the previous minister, to put in place an incentive regime to encourage exploration in Australia. We might have a disagreement about the nature of the exploration incentive, but what we have in place, despite the failure of the previous government on three occasions to create such an incentive, is what I consider to be a major breakthrough for the smaller companies who face a competitive disadvantage in terms of exploration in Australia. I say that because, with respect to those smaller companies, the losses they generate from exploration often cannot be used to offset other taxable income. We actually had a debate about the appropriate form to developing an exploration incentive for that sector of the Australian community. Our intention is simply to rebate with significant benefits the exploration investment of small preprofit exploration companies at the company tax rate.</para>
<para>The proposal we have on the table with effect from 1 July of next year will also apply to the geothermal sector of the renewable energy industry in Australia. They need some assistance because, to my own way of thinking, that is where we will make one of the breakthroughs in renewable energy. That is akin to a baseload coal fired power station in Australia—reliable energy—which is so important to the future of Australia. We also not only put in place an exploration incentive but extended it to the geothermal industry as part of our energy security debate in the future. The proposal, to my way of thinking, is simpler and more effective and will promote investment, more so, I believe, than a flowthrough share scheme. The fact is that small exploration companies do not receive a tax benefit from their deductible exploration expenses until they have become profitable. This is of considerable assistance to the small end of town.</para>
<para>That also takes me to why we have to do this. I remind the House that the number of exploration meters drilled in 2009 fell 25 per cent, to just over seven million meters. Brownfield drilling in 2009, the year of the global financial crisis, represented 67 per cent—which is a real problem for Australia—of all exploration drilling, up from 61 per cent in 2008. That is why I hope, as a result of this incentive, we will not be putting in any rules as to how the incentive will be applied. I hope and encourage some of those exploration companies to trend away from brownfield exploration to invest in greenfield exploration because that exploration has the capacity to establish the opportunities for the big projects in 20 and 30 years time. A similar exploration, years ago, led to the discoveries of such important resources as Olympic Dam, the new Prominent Hill and the Mount Isa opportunities that Australia is benefiting from now.</para>
<para>I also want to go to the issue of infrastructure. For a long time we have underestimated the need for investment in infrastructure, in the resources sector, at Commonwealth level. The states have not been up to the task. In some ways, some of the difficulties we now confront in infrastructure represent the negligence by both state and territory governments and the Commonwealth government of investment in resource sector infrastructure. We are about making sure—through a $5.6 billion package over the next decade—that we have the capacity, federally, to work with state and territory governments and the resources sector to fund the roads, railways, ports and utilities so necessary to unlock Australia’s resource wealth. If you have any doubts about that you should go to the Pilbara. They have major infrastructure issues, and difficulties for the local people in that the cost of a house up there is $1.2 million because of a failure to put more land on the market for the purpose of residential subdivisions.</para>
<para>In conclusion, there are a variety of other benefits to small business, including facilitating investment in superannuation in Australia. This is a complex debate. The government is committed to getting it right through proper consultation. It is not an easy debate—in the mind of the opposition it clearly is an easy political target which is going to achieve huge political donations out of a particular sector. I commend the consultation process to the House.

<para>—Once again, we are presented with a big new tax. This tax purports to be a resources superprofits tax, with the emphasis, no doubt, on profits. By so doing, it sounds good, safe and acceptable to attack the big, rich mining companies, and for good measure we throw in the fact that many of these companies are no longer in majority Australian ownership—a touch of xenophobia, as the shadow minister just put it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I wonder what the Prime Minister’s motivation might be for this tax. Maybe he wants to be seen as a tough guy. Maybe he wants to show the unions he can slap down the big miners. But I suspect, above all, he wants to create yet another distraction from his broken promises, his woeful performances on such matters as health, the BER, the pink batts, the CPRS, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch and other debacles—it goes on and on.</para>
<para>But this particular move is so inept that its downside effects and its implementation are creating lives of their own. Let me explain how. As the economist Tim Hughes said in the opening paragraph of his article in the
<inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline>
yesterday:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Prime Minister’s resources super profits tax is, without a doubt, the worst tax decision ever made by an Australian government. And the day after announcing it he could not even explain how it worked.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I just pose a rhetorical question: if John Hewson’s fumble on the application of the GST to a cake—to a cake, mind you—became the flashpoint for the 1993 election, how much worse is this tax, striking at the heart of Australia’s currently most successful industry, as a flashpoint for the 2010 election? Worse still, it is an attack on our international reputation as a secure home for investment. It raises important questions of sovereign risk as well as capital investment leaving our shores.</para>
<para>One example is Queensland’s gas resources and the effect of this tax on the development of Gladstone, which I represented for 14 years. The port city of Gladstone was born of industry and its future is industry, but this government has condemned it to the scrap heap. In recent years, investors have poured millions of dollars into the city on the back of the LNG boom which is about to occur. Families have moved there for work and people have set up businesses on the back of the anticipated growth. Because of the uncertainty arising from the government’s actions, we see at least one company, Santos, putting its plans for Gladstone on hold. If it had escaped the Prime Minister’s notice, there are $50 billion worth of coal seam gas to LNG projects in Queensland alone that are now at risk, in varying degrees. I have been told that that is the equivalent of 18,000 jobs a year, and we need every single one of those jobs for our towns, our state and our country.</para>
<para>Further afield, we hear Xstrata is ceasing exploration activities in the great North West Queensland Mineral Province. What does that mean for Mount Isa, Cloncurry and Townsville? Already, the Western Australian miner Cape Lambert Resources has cancelled exploration projects in Australia in favour of Africa. And no doubt, as we are debating this issue in parliament today, more examples of mining companies going cold on this government are emerging. Ironically, just last week we had the ministers of the Bligh government tripping all over Queensland with their new plans for regionalisation. What a cruel irony—when the federal government has effectively put regional Australia, particularly Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, on the chopping block.</para>
<para>Is this government deliberately setting out to kill regional communities and economies with this tax? I ask the question. One would have to seriously wonder about it. Even the premiers of the states cannot hide their disbelief and anger—and two of those premiers are Labor premiers. Honourable members will also be aware of pending coal developments throughout Central Queensland and the Surat Basin. Not only are expanding communities like Dalby, Chinchilla, Roma and Wandoan involved but new infrastructure such as railway lines is depending on these projects going ahead.</para>
<para>The trickle-down effect is even more insidious. Not only do we have miners and tradesmen working in the industry directly on site but we have another cohort of minors who fly in and fly out of Queensland’s provincial cities and towns. They support a vast array of shops and services not only on the coalfields but in expanding provincial cities like Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Rockhampton and Mackay. The mining industry also depends on an expert supply chain of dragline scoops, dozers, heavy trucks, loaders and so on. Engineering firms service equipment. Technicians maintain generators. Small businesses benefit by providing fuel, transport, food and other everyday living items. Health services and education should not be forgotten.</para>
<para>This is a pervasive tax that strikes at the heart of resource based states and—I repeat—particularly Queensland and Western Australia. But it does not even stop there. In the same way that mining is not confined to iron ore, coal and bauxite, this tax affects other forms of mining, such as quarrying and fertiliser extraction. We cry out for better roads and highways, but this tax will vastly increase the costs of gravels and screenings necessary for those roads and highways. Cement for the construction industry will be affected by the tax on the mining of limestone. Here we might reflect again on Gladstone. Not only is it the home of a limestone mine but it has the largest cement works in Australia.</para>
<para>This insidious tax invades the commercial and home construction industries, because not only do we need copious quantities of cement and concrete blocks but we also need bricks, and that involves the mining of clay. Therefore, expect dearer building supplies. Fertiliser is crucial for productive farming and in many instances also for experts. Phosphates are also mined in this country, so there will be a downstream effect on the cost of agricultural and horticultural products.</para>
<para>Some might say, ‘Oh, well: this is the price of progress in and around the mining sector.’ But it does not stop there, either. Let us have a look at the effect on the average investor. It is said that BHP has 400,000 small investors, many of whom would be mums and dads, and even kids, who have extensive or modest holdings in the Big Australian. In less than a fortnight, $90 billion has been written off the value of mining shares and, as such, off the investments of these Australians.</para>
<para>Even more insidious still is the impact on the superannuation sector. The retirement savings of every self-funded retiree and worker in this nation have been struck down by this new tax on mining. At the end of last year, Australian superannuation funds held approximately $1.2 trillion in assets. Around 30 per cent of large Australian superannuation funds were invested in shares. That is the equivalent of $370 billion. Mining shares account for around 30 per cent of our stock market. From that you can extrapolate that about 10 per cent of the assets of superannuation funds are invested in mining shares. This tax will have a profound effect on part-pensioners and self-funded retirees. In electorates like mine, the communities of Hervey Bay, Bundaberg and Bargara will suffer. Why? Because they have one of the highest retirement profiles in Australia. And a lot of the retirees there are self-funded retirees. This tax move will impact severely on them. Since the government’s announcement of this new tax, more than $14 billion has been wiped off the value of the superannuation savings of Australians.</para>
<para>In summary, it is not just a tax—as it has been characterised and as, no doubt, the ALP will continue to present it to their union mates—on ugly mining companies. It is worse than that. It is a slap at national wealth and opportunity and the remarkable industry that has driven this country for so long. It will affect myriads of ordinary Australians, starting from those working in the mining companies—many of which are likely to move their investments to more welcoming environments overseas. It will affect miners and all those working in the downstream industries that flow from mining. It will also affect the regional communities, especially those in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory.

<para>—The tax proposal to which we are referring today is the superprofit tax on resources companies. We are having this debate because the government has determined that it would be appropriate to discuss and propose an arrangement for an increased tax on our resources sector. Many years ago—30 years ago—I was a student at the Australian National University doing economics. I first heard of the idea of rent taxes—pure profit taxes—in the late 1970s and early 1980s when I was a student. The idea is simple: you tax the economic rent from a project or an entity and in doing so you do not compromise optimal economic decision making by that entity. It is very simple and it is very straightforward. Normal returns are preserved.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the mid 1980s, the then Labor government proposed the petroleum resource rent tax. It came in with a long-term bond rate and a five per cent uplift factor on production and with a long-term bond rate plus 15 per cent uplift on exploration. It is a tax that has operated quietly for 25 years. It is wrong to think that its quiet and successful operation was not controversial. At the time of its introduction, we had had a move to global oil pricing in Australia—so-called world parity pricing. We had had the debate among states about their own excise regimes and royalty rates and about what we would do in the face of increased global energy prices. The inefficiencies in the oil taxation system in our country were significant.</para>
<para>At that time the resources minister sat down with his adviser—now a minister in this government, Craig Emerson—under the advice of Professor Ross Garnaut and discussed the proposal for a resource rent tax on the petroleum sector. It was not an easy discussion. The minister at that time has since told me of the reaction of the oil industry. It is true, as the shadow minister reflects, that BHP—nowadays BHP Petroleum but in those days BHP—understood the arithmetic that underpinned the idea of a rent tax, but not everyone did. He tells me of the oil entrepreneurs who would call him to their offices to receive their own corporate view of how damaging this new oil tax would be. He told me of how he as the Minister for Resources would refuse to go to their offices and would ask them to come to his. They came to his office and they received both a lesson in politics and a lesson in economics.</para>
<para>I do not think anyone these days, despite the 25 years of successful operation, seriously contends that the resource rent tax on the petroleum sector is not a good tax. But let me make you aware of this: no-one in the oil industry likes it; everyone in the oil and gas industry hates it. When I was an executive in Australia’s largest exploration and production company we would regularly face tirades from senior executives or board members who wished to get rid of that tax, who spent a lot of money doing research on how to get rid of that tax and who would argue that that tax must constrain the development of projects. But in a decade it was not possible to identify one project—not one project—that would have gone ahead if that tax had been removed.</para>
<para>Of course, the Minister for Resources and Energy has told us today of the investment decision by Woodside to go ahead with the Pluto project in a resource rent tax regime and the decision by Chevron and its partners to go ahead with the Gorgon project, a $40 billion plus investment in a resource rent tax regime. We know that the particular form of taxation that we are proposing here is not an exact replica of the resource rent tax. It is not. It contains a number of elements that are in many ways substantial improvements on the resource rent tax. It allows portability of expenses. It allows for incentives for projects into the future. But, most importantly, I was reminded just 24 hours ago of the review of taxation being conducted for those opposite—the opposition—by Henry Ergas, formerly, as I understand it, a department of finance officer. For 15 months or more the coalition has sat on its own tax review. We are told via media reports—one published in February of this year—that the Ergas report recommends a resource rent tax. We are told—and this is the quote: ‘There are significant benefits to the Resource Rent Tax approach because it tries to quarantine tax to economic rents.’ You would only tax above a normal rate of return.</para>
<para>What does that tell you? It tells you that the coalition’s own economic adviser and author of its own tax review has championed the idea of a resource rent tax. We also know that, of the 25 years of quiet operation of the resource rent tax, 12 were under opposition—coalition—governments. And we know that the tax was not dismantled, removed or taken away. We know that the government appreciated the integrity of that tax and we know that the government enjoyed the revenues from it. How do we know that? We simply look at the record.</para>
<para>I remind people again of the quote from Henry Ergas that there are significant benefits to the resource rent tax approach. What does that mean? The tax is structured so that it does not change any of the fundamental project economics behind an investment or an operation. We know that the Minerals Council of Australia supports the tax model, and we know that the Minerals Council of Australia has supported this tax proposal because it creates harmony of the taxation system between the states. We know that bauxite mining in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia face different taxation regimes. If you are a resource owner looking at tenements in any of those three states, you know that you face different taxation regimes and charges across the board. For iron ore in Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia, different royalty regimes operate. For coal in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, again substantially different rates of taxation apply. So it is not surprising that the bosses of the mining industry associations in Queensland, in South Australia, in Western Australia and elsewhere have asked for certainty in the fiscal arrangements and not for political squabbling. They have asked for certainty in the way in which the taxation regime works.</para>
<para>In the course of the last seven or eight days since the announcement of these proposals we have also had substantial industry interaction with the government to negotiate, to understand, to get it right—to engage in dialogue to get the taxation system right. I sometimes wonder if members opposite are at all interested in getting the taxation system right. I have thought that for a long time. Sometimes they will find a good tax and just stay with it because it is a good idea, as they did with the resource rent tax in the petroleum sector. But sometimes they just see a good earner and they lock onto it. Sometimes they see a good idea for party fundraising and they get in behind it with both paws. I quote from a story in today’s

<para class="block">Here we go: we are supposed to be having a debate here about taxes. We are supposed to be having a debate around resource taxes. We are supposed to be having a debate around a resource super tax. But no, what we actually have here is an opportunity to fundraise. Let us not kid ourselves. The debate here is not about a resource tax; the debate here was appropriately pinged in the

this morning. The angry miners said they were unlikely to tip a bucket of money to the coalition’s war chest. Do you blame them? They said it would be unwise. Of course it is unwise. It is unwise because the miners fundamentally are most interested in getting a taxation system right. They have been wound up into fever pitch sometimes by their own supporters—fever pitch designed to create less serious consideration around the proposition for a tax. If they can, they will knock it out and not pay it. As I said, I worked for a company that worked very hard to try to get this tax ameliorated, changed or removed because companies—guess what?—just do not like paying tax. The other thing we learn from the newspaper today is that they just do not like making donations to the Liberal Party either.

<para>—It is good to be able to follow the member for Groom and the member for Hinkler. But I fear for the member for Brand because he talks about fundraising. I have seen the fundraising letters that go out from the member for Brand. We have seen those go out asking for donations of up to $10,000 because they do not have to be declared. So do not let the member for Brand bring on the fundraising stuff. I fear for him because I know how many fly-in fly-out residents he has in the electorate of Brand. You have a lot, and they are hopping mad.</para>

<para>Make no mistake: the resources supertax is already impacting negatively on the lives and the futures of all Australians, and in particular Western Australians. It is real. We heard last week that Western Australian iron ore miner Cape Lambert Resources will pull out of exploration projects in WA and move to Africa. I fear there will be more to follow. What we should ask is: who is next? This government or this Prime Minister decided that any profit above six per cent is a superprofit. How can someone who has been in business—and I know the member for Brand has been in business—arbitrarily say that above six per cent is a superprofit? How can you say that?</para>

<para>—Yes, normal! I say to every business in Australia: beware. If you earn more than six per cent, watch out in the future. This government cannot be trusted to stop at the mining industry to support their superspending program. Big and small businesses in WA have condemned the tax. Large mining companies have also expressed major concerns. It seems the only people not concerned are the government. In this House today the PM refused to rule out further industries being taxed by this government that considers profit above six per cent as super.</para>

<para>As a representative for the people of Swan I am urging the government not to ignore the thousands of people, many within my electorate, asking the government not to bring in this supertax. They are worried about their jobs. This will affect the residents of Swan regardless of whether they are connected to the resource industry. There will be job losses in Swan—and, I am sure, also in Brand—which the Rudd Labor government will be held responsible for. Seniors in particular over the last week have contacted my office about the damage of the Rudd Labor government announcement on their superannuation and about the pain they will feel. The residents of Swan expect real action from their government, real action on border protection, real action on reducing the debt and real action on insulation compensation for homes affected by airport noise—not just a new tax to cover up their superspending program. This is not a tax on superprofits; this is a supertax.</para>
<para>According to the statistics in the WA government Department of Mines and Petroleum website, close to 70,000 people are employed in the local mining sector, and the flow-on effect of many people’s future being in doubt will reverberate not only through the WA economy but through the national economy. Before the 2007 election Kevin Rudd promised WA a fairer share of the take and a $100 million infrastructure fund. To all WA people: we have not got them, and we now only get 68c in the dollar for every dollar we contribute in the GST system from our great state. The member for Batman also talked about a fairer system. This is why they want to introduce this tax: a fairer system. Where is the fairness in Western Australia only getting 68c in the GST system?</para>
<para>This is just a grab by the government to nationalise and to centralise funding out of the mining sector. The PM said WA would get more through this new infrastructure fund from this supertax. Well, Mr Rudd, we in WA do not believe you. You cannot be trusted. I have read through the recently completed Radar Group study commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia,
<inline font-style="italic">Institutional investor perception study: impact of the proposed resource super profits tax</inline>. All the institutional investors surveyed believe the government’s adoption of this tax was ill-conceived and will have a highly detrimental effect on the Australian economy. We are talking about an industry that over the last 10 years has paid $80 billion in royalties and company tax. The Prime Minister talks about $9 billion a year. Multiply that by 10 and that is $90 billion a year he wants to take out of an industry that has only paid $80 billion over the last decade. This is just a government that has lost control of everything it is involved with.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak in support of the initiatives that the government has handed down as part of its tax package. It is a tax package that will strengthen the economy and a package that will make our tax system both simpler and fairer. I want to address some of the issues that were raised earlier in this debate, but I think to give this some context we have to remember that the two competing sides in this argument—the parties that come to this debate—have been engaged in this struggle before. There are the builders, those who are committed to securing and sharing the national wealth in the national interest, and there are those who are prepared to preserve sectional interests and to oppose changes that are in the national interest.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let us have a look at the petroleum resource rent tax, which even those on the other side now seem to acknowledge is a fair tax that ensures Australians are able to capture a fair share of the mineral resources being exploited by companies. Let us go back to when that tax was introduced. No-one wants to talk about the fact that those on the other side, in the same way as they are now running around saying the whole world will fall in, opposed that tax. If I can quote a Liberal Party frontbencher at the time, Alexander Downer—someone, I know, a lot of people on that side of the House have a lot of respect for—he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The resource rent tax which will be introduced by this Government will only make matters considerably worse because it will impose a new burden upon those people who are prepared to put money up front and to go out and explore for oil. It will put a new burden on the risk takers in the oil industry, apparently because the Government, for reasons of its own, resents and despises these people.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Sounds familiar. The National Party leader at the time, Ian Sinclair, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">With the proposed resource rent tax on 40 per cent, very few high risk exploration prospects will be capable of proceeding or are likely to proceed. Indeed, they are likely to be most unattractive.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is what they said, back when the petroleum resource rent tax was being introduced. What have we seen since then? We no longer see the opposition from those on the other side. In fact, whilst in government they were prepared to take advantage of some of the benefits of having collected that resource rent tax over time. And we see that we have had projects such as the Pluto project, worth $12 billion, and the Gorgon project, the biggest single project in Australian history, worth $43 billion, proceed and progress under this set of tax arrangements. So, when they talk about a resource rent tax or the resource superprofits tax stifling investment, let’s have a look at the record of what actually occurred and was achieved under the petroleum resource rent tax.</para>
<para>One of the big fallacies that is brought forward by those on the other side is where they come in and say, ‘This big scary tax, this big supertax on everything.’ It is not a tax on everything. But ‘this big tax’, they say, has depleted the superannuation savings of poor pensioners, superannuants and retirees all around this country. It is interesting that they should say that, because those who actually know something about superannuation, the Industry Super Network, released a report yesterday dismissing the opposition’s claims. Their research indicates that for a member with a super balance of $50,000, which is the average super balance for members of an industry fund, last week’s volatility in mining shares on the ASX—which they all attribute to the suggestion that we are going to introduce a resource superprofits tax—would amount, for someone with an average balance, to a variation to the fund balance of $57. That is the impact: $57. Most observers would suggest that the impact we have seen on mining shares in the last week is not going to be an ongoing thing and is a temporary reaction to what has occurred.</para>

<para>—by leave—The Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act requires the committee to consider draft estimates for the Audit Office, with the chair ultimately making a statement to the House on budget day on whether, in our opinion, the Auditor-General has been given sufficient funding to carry out his duties. In support of this process the Auditor-General is empowered under his act to disclose to the committee his budget proposals, which we then consider and use to make representations to government as necessary. This process reflects both the committee’s status as the parliament’s audit committee and the Auditor-General’s status as an independent officer of the parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The committee met with the Auditor-General in February to review the Audit Office’s budget proposals for the coming financial year. The Auditor-General advised that he would be seeking additional funding of $5.6 million, over five years, in this year’s budget. The additional funding was to be applied in three main areas. First, the Audit Office sought $5.3 million for audit work required following the establishment and projected expansion of the National Broadband Network Company Ltd. This additional audit work is mandatory under section 13 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, which requires the Audit Office to audit the financial statements of Commonwealth companies and their subsidiaries. The additional expense will be offset in full by audit fee revenue, although in this context it is important to note that such revenue is returned to the budget rather than being available to the Audit Office.</para>
<para>As I said in my corresponding statement last year, the committee believes that the Audit Office should be fully funded for any new obligations that government places upon it, particularly where new agencies are established. The committee is therefore pleased that the Audit Office will receive the additional funding it sought in this year’s budget in relation to the NBN Company Ltd. The committee also notes that the recent transfer of the office of Indigenous evaluation and audit from the Department of Finance to the Audit Office has been properly accompanied by ongoing funding of approximately $4 million per year.</para>
<para>The Auditor-General advised the committee in February that he would also be seeking an additional $1.5 million over five years in support of his reviews of compliance of proposed government advertising campaigns with guidelines for agencies issued in July 2008. This funding request was withdrawn late in the budget process when, following a review of the guidelines by Dr Allan Hawke, the Auditor-General’s role in providing review reports on proposed advertising campaigns was abolished, on 31 March.</para>
<para>Finally, the Audit Office sought $5.3 million for the period 2009-10 to 2013-14, partially offset by audit fees of approximately $1.2 million, to meet the workload associated with the full revision to the Australian auditing and assurance standards, which reflects changes to international auditing standards. As a result of these changes some 41 revised auditing standards become effective in 2010-11. The changes result in an increase of about a third in mandatory auditing procedures, with the extent of new requirements exceeding 20 per cent. The changes therefore increase financial statement audit efforts significantly and require updates to audit methodology and related training.</para>
<para>The Audit Office has not been successful in its bid for funding this year for this additional workload. While this is disappointing, the committee acknowledges that in last year’s budget the Audit Office, with the committee’s strong support, received an additional $20.1 million over four years. This enabled the Audit Office to restore its target number of performance audits to the traditional level of around 50 audits per year, following a reduction to 45 for the 2008-09 financial year. The Audit Office’s total revenue from government is estimated at $73 million in 2010-11. The Auditor-General has advised that the appropriation for the year ahead will allow him to meet his obligations, including maintaining his targets for production of performance audit reports and public sector better practice guides. The committee therefore endorses the budget proposed for the Audit Office for 2010-11.</para>
<para>However, the committee is concerned by the lack of new funding in support of the revision to the auditing and assurance standards. While the new standards should enhance public confidence in the quality and relevance of all its services, the committee is of the view that they will significantly increase the effort required to audit the financial statements of public sector entities. Based on its internal analysis and external assessments—most notably from the United Kingdom—the Audit Office estimates that the new requirements will result in an average increase of five per cent in financial statement audit effort, based on its auditee profile of 275 small entities and 34 material entities.</para>
<para>Given that the financial statement audits and the associated professional standards are mandatory obligations for the Audit Office, there is a risk that ongoing budget pressure in this important area of audit activity may in time force the Auditor-General to, again, reduce his program of performance audits and better practice guides. The committee continues to assert that any such downgrade would be a false economy and not in the interests of either the parliament or the people it serves. The committee notes that the Auditor-General made a similarly unsuccessful request in last year’s budget for additional funding to meet the costs of the revision to the auditing and assurance standards, and previously received only partial funding for the substantial increase in audit workload arising from the introduction, from 2008-09, of the general government sector financial statement. The committee therefore flags its support for any request by the Auditor-General in next year’s budget process for additional funding to meet the costs of the revised auditing standards.</para>
<para>In the longer term, the committee also notes that the Auditor-General has previously suggested that it would be desirable to have in place arrangements that allow the Audit Office’s funding to be adjusted in line with changes in the scale of the public sector. We agree that this matter requires further consideration to ensure that the Audit Office is properly funded into the future and able to discharge its responsibilities to the parliament. I present a copy of my statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on the
<inline ref="R4164">Information Commissioner Bill 2009</inline>
and the
<inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009</inline>. Freedom of information, the statutory right of access to government documents, is justified on the grounds that it encourages transparency and political accountability and discourages corruption and other forms of wrongdoing. At the federal level, it was the Fraser government that first introduced freedom of information into Australia in 1982 through the Freedom of Information Act of the same year. This formed part of a broader package of administrative law reforms promulgated during the 1970s and 1980s, and this made Australia the first country with a Westminster system of government to legislate for freedom of information. In subsequent years, following the Commonwealth’s taking the lead, similar legislation was passed in all Australian states and territories.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As noted in the
<inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>
for the FOI Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009, these FOI acts have certain major features in common. First, government is obliged to publish information about its activities in general and about whether it holds certain kinds of documents. Second, every person has a legal right to obtain access to information in documentary form, subject to the operation of specific exemptions and exclusions, which is in the possession of ministers or government agencies. Exemptions can apply to specified agencies—for example, our domestic or international intelligence agencies or the police forces of the state jurisdictions—or to categories of documents, such as documents that deal with international relations or international security. A third feature of FOI acts is the personal privacy dimension, which enables a person who has gained access to a document held by government that relates to his or her personal affairs to request that the document be amended in some respect, to appeal against a refusal to amend the document and—even if the appeal is unsuccessful—to request that an annotation be attached to accompany the record when it is shown to any other person. The last feature common to all the FOI regimes is a right of review in relation to most decisions made under the acts—that is, internal review within the agency and further review by a body external to the decision maker.</para>
<para>The Rudd government’s position on freedom of information, like so much of what we see from this government, mirrors its failings in other policy areas. Prior to the 2007 federal election the Rudd government was very heavy on rhetoric, but after it was elected FOI was added to its list of comprehensive policy failures and broken promises. When in opposition, Rudd Labor stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A Rudd Labor Government will restore trust and integrity in the use of Commonwealth Government information, promoting a pro-disclosure culture and protecting the public interest through genuine reform.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Labor Party when in opposition described its approach to making information more accessible to the general public with the colourful phrase Operation Sunlight. However, although the government is very good at sloganeering, it is very bad at follow-through. The Labor Party’s election policy document was entitled
<inline font-style="italic">Government information: restoring trust and integrity in government information</inline>. This document foreshadowed significant changes to freedom of information legislation. It stated that a Labor government would abolish conclusive certificates and implement the recommendations of the
<inline font-style="italic">Open government: a review of the federal Freedom of Information Act 1982
</inline>report. It is interesting to note that the government promised a pro-disclosure policy and cultural change when it came to freedom of information requests, but its own figures, quietly released three days before Christmas last year, show that its rhetoric on FOI has failed to match that reality. Doesn’t the fact that the government released the report on its failure to adhere to its Operation Sunlight promises three days before Christmas say everything about how this government operates?</para>
<para>The
<inline font-style="italic">2008-09 Freedom of information annual report</inline>
shows that the Labor government have refused more FOI requests than did the previous coalition government. The government’s own figures show there is less freedom of information under the Rudd government than there was under the Howard government. The Rudd government’s heroic pro-disclosure rhetoric from opposition stands in stark contrast to the cold, hard statistical reality that they have implemented since they have been in government. The annual report is dated 31 October 2009, but the Rudd government waited until 22 December, a time when the political cycle is at a pretty low ebb, to quietly release it because it contained a litany of their failures in this area. The timing of the report’s release alone demonstrates the reality of the Rudd government’s attitude to disclosure. My colleague, the shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, was quoted in the
<inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>
on 30 December 2009:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A reduction in the number of successful FOI applications of 10 per cent, and an increase in the number of outright refusals of almost 1 1/2 times, is certainly evidence of a change of culture within the government towards the release of information. Unfortunately, it demonstrates that the trend is in the opposite direction from that promised by Faulkner.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Far from bringing about the dawn of a new age of access to government information, the Rudd government has done the very opposite. As Senator Brandis also noted:</para>
<quote>
<para>The exemptions in the FOI Act were invoked to block disclosure in 6.1 per cent of cases. By comparison, in the last full year of the Howard government, only 4.4 per cent of FOI applications were refused outright. The number of applications granted in part only was 22.9 per cent. The comparable figure in the last year of the Howard government was 15 per cent. In all, only 71 per cent of applications were granted in full; the comparable figure in the last year of the Howard government was 80.6 per cent.</para>
</quote>
<para>As noted by the coalition senators in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration’s report, the cost of facilitating FOI requests has also increased substantially under the Rudd Labor government. From the last full financial year of the Howard government until the first full financial year of the Rudd government, the cost of FOI increased from just under $25 million to over $30 million—an increase of over 21 per cent. Given the increasing cost of facilitating FOI requests and the decline in the number of FOI access requests, in the two years between 2006-07 and 2008-09 there has been an extraordinary increase in the average cost per FOI request. In 2006-07 the average cost per FOI request was $642, whereas in 2008-09 the cost per request was $1,101—an increase of 71 per cent over two years. These facts contradict Labor’s purported commitment to ‘promoting a pro-disclosure culture and protecting the public interest’. The government’s commitment to a pro-disclosure culture was put to the test last year. The behaviour of public servants in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in their response to an FOI request from Dr Richard Denniss from the Australia Institute was reported in the
<inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>
on 30 January 2010. The article read:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Even though the department rang Denniss to confirm that he wanted advice to the minister, and the department’s lawyers said this was covered by the request, it was excluded on the instruction of departmental head … and his deputy …</para>
<para class="block">Not easily deterred, Denniss fired in another request asking for documents prepared to help inform Wong—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, Senator Wong—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">and her advisers of the details, merits, limitations and criticisms of the ETS. The response: he may be able to get what he wants if he hands over $256,586.98—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">over a quarter of a million dollars—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">although, catch-22, if he proceeds with his request, the department may decide it involves an unreasonable diversion of resources.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is not clear what else the department of climate change actually have to do, but clearly they were not keen under this minister to facilitate Operation Sunlight, so proudly announced by Labor in opposition and so woefully adhered to in government. This example about a prominent public policy issue further illustrates that the Labor government is not honouring its election commitment to create a pro-disclosure culture and that Labor’s rhetoric on FOI does not match the reality of continued denial of access to information.</para>
<para>I move to some of the specifics. The Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009 contains key amendments: (1) introducing an information publication scheme which would require agencies to proactively disclose more information to the public (2) changing the time periods for access under the Archives Act, from 30 years to 20 years for all documents and from 50 years to 30 years for cabinet notebooks (3) abolishing FOI application fees, abolishing all charges for a person seeking access to their own information, making the first hour of decision-making time charge free for all FOI requests and allowing a five-hour charge free period for journalists and not-for-profit organisations (4) a single public interest test for disclosure (5) extending the FOI Act to cover documents held by service providers to the government and (6) introducing an objects clause to emphasise that the aim of the act is to give the Australian community access to information held by the government.</para>
<para>The bill that we are debating concurrently, the Information Commissioner Bill 2009, establishes the Office of the Information Commissioner, which was part of the reform of the FOI regime announced in March 2009. The functions of this office will be threefold: the FOI functions, which are about giving the Australian community access to information held by the government in accordance with the FOI Act; the privacy functions, which are about protecting the privacy of individuals in accordance with the Privacy Act and other acts; and the Information Commissioner functions, which are strategic functions concerning advice to government on information management.</para>
<para>As noted in the bill’s explanatory memorandum, the Information Commissioner, which is a new position, will be head of the office. The Information Commissioner will be able to perform all of the functions of that office. To ensure a workable governance arrangement, the Information Commissioner will be head of the office both strategically and administratively. Provision is made in the bill to ensure that no duplication arises in carrying out functions between the three commissioners and to ensure that no disagreement arises in the discharge of those functions.</para>
<para>The FOl Commissioner, which is also a new position, will mainly perform the FOI functions. For flexibility, the FOI Commissioner will also be able to perform the privacy functions. The Privacy Commissioner is an existing position established under the Privacy Act; however, the Privacy Commissioner will be appointed under this bill. The Privacy Commissioner will mainly perform the privacy functions. For flexibility, the Privacy Commissioner will also be able to perform the FOI functions. It is proposed in the bill that the existing Office of the Privacy Commissioner be amalgamated into the Office of the Information Commissioner.</para>
<para>The FOl functions of the Information Commissioner include: promoting an understanding of the FOI Act; assisting agencies to publish information in accordance with the publication scheme; providing guidelines, advice and training to agencies; and conducting investigations and reviews of decisions. In effect, it will perform an ombudsman’s role in relation to information matters.</para>
<para>I understand that discussions are underway between the opposition and the government regarding the onus of proof provision. Whilst the coalition supports these bills in principle, further amendments will be made in the Senate. I trust that the government and the opposition, with a bit of goodwill on both sides, will be able to find common ground on these two bills. As mentioned in the
<inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>
regarding the FOI Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009, there is an argument that in a number of areas the reforms do not go far enough. A common theme in submissions to the Senate inquiry was that, while the bill repeals a small number of exemptions, it retains an almost entirely untouched list of excluded agencies and documents held by certain agencies listed in schedule 2 of the FOI Act.</para>
<para>The two bills are not the end of the story. In relation to two key aspects of the FOI Act—namely, access to and amendment of one’s own personal information and the imposition of processing charges for FOI requests—the government has promised further reform. However, by the government’s own reckoning, access to government information is much less free today than it was prior to the change of government. The coalition have consistently stated support for any reforms to the freedom of information regime that would result in improved public access to information. So, whilst we commend this bill and support it in principle, it is on the basis that in the past two years freedom of information has gone substantially backwards under Kevin Rudd and his Labor government.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I am proud to support the two bills before the House: the
<inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009</inline>
and the
<inline ref="R4164">Information Commissioner Bill 2009</inline>. These bills represent the most substantial reforms to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 since it was enacted by this parliament. It is somewhat regrettable, perhaps even laughable, to hear from an opposition spokesman claiming that the coalition has a commitment to open and responsible government and indeed, by the selection of a handful of statistics or a handful of anecdotes, seeking to ignore the major nature of the reforms that are contained in this legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There has already been very substantial reform contained in legislation considered by this House, namely the Freedom of Information (Removal of Conclusive Certificates and Other Measures) Bill 2008, which was debated last year. That marked the first stage of amendments to the freedom of information regime. Really, the removal of conclusive certificates and what the conclusive certificates represented tells all the story that one needs to know about the true or actual commitment of the coalition to open government. Conclusive certificates, of course, were what lay at the heart of the former government’s resistance to the release of information, notably in a case where the former government went all the way to the High Court. It was a case brought by Michael McKinnon, a very senior News Ltd journalist, who was requesting documents that were concerned with bracket creep and material relating to the first home owners scheme—precisely the kind of material one might expect to see being requested under freedom of information legislation. The former government’s attitude to FOI was revealed by the way in which that request was refused and then fought at every single level all the way to the High Court of Australia.</para>
<para>This government’s first legislative act in relation to the freedom of information regime was to abolish those conclusive certificates provisions, and as was foreshadowed by the former Special Minister of State, Senator Faulkner, we now have before the House the substantial set of reforms contained in these two bills. They are a set of reforms that have been long awaited because they are based not merely on more recent reviews and reviews by the Attorney-General’s Department and not merely on what has been very longstanding Australian Labor Party policy. They are based on a review that was finalised by a joint report by the Administrative Review Council and the Australian Law Reform Commission in 1996. It contained a very large number of recommendations. It was itself, at that point, the most substantial review that had been conducted of the Commonwealth freedom of information legislation. As was commented on at the very start of that joint report of the ALRC and the Administrative Review Council, at that point—some 13 years since the act had come into operation—it was long enough for the shortcomings of the legislation to have been uncovered and for some very coherent work to be done on what changes were appropriate to make the freedom of information regime work better.</para>
<para>But that extensive report, the Open Government report of those two bodies, was ignored by the former government for the whole of its term of office. The very substantial reforms, which were carefully thought through and were the subject of very many submissions that were considered by those two bodies in their substantial report, were all ignored by the former government, and that is where we see the true commitment of the coalition parties to open government and to freedom of information—which is, of course, no commitment at all. We had to wait for the Rudd Labor government to come to office, bringing with it very detailed commitments for amendments to the freedom of information regime, for there to be an enactment and legislation presented in this House, first abolishing conclusive certificates and followed up by this set of comprehensive reforms to the whole regime, which will change the system. That is why the complaints voiced by the member for Stirling should be seen as the laughable complaints that they are. Rather than talk about the substantial reforms contained in this legislation, we had reference only to a handful of statistics—pretty much the same approach that was taken by the coalition senators participating in the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee which looked at this legislation. The coalition senators participating in the report—Senators Brandis, Ryan and Kroger—commenced their dissenting report with the risible claim:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Coalition is committed to responsible and open government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As I have said, the record of the former government speaks for itself. It had before it this extraordinarily detailed report by the two bodies—the ALRC and the Administrative Review Council—and chose to ignore all of those recommendations. There was no action to reform the freedom of information system and from that report—indicating that at that point some 13 years had passed since the act had been passed—we have had to wait another 14 or 15 years to get to this legislation before the House of Representatives in order to have substantial reform.</para>
<para>It is the case that freedom of information legislation deals only with one form of release of government information. Government information is released by this parliament collectively, it is released and made available to the public by members of this parliament individually, it is made available by ministers and it is made available by government departments. It should not be thought that the Freedom of Information Act is in any sense a code which fully describes the means by which government information is to be made available. What it does is to provide an additional means by which government information can be made available, and it does so because it is recognised, or at least recognised in democracies throughout the world, that the provision of information empowers citizens; that the provision of government information in every sense creates better government and in every sense makes it possible for citizens to participate more fully in the processes of government and for those engaged in the process of government, being members of this parliament, government ministers and officers of departments, to govern better.</para>
<para>I wish to comment briefly on the creation of the new offices, which is the purpose of the Information Commissioner Bill. The bill adds to the existing office of Privacy Commissioner the office of FOI Commissioner and the office of Information Commissioner, and it uses those newly created offices to set up a structure by which, for the first time in our freedom of information system, there will be a champion of FOI. There will also be a simpler means for review of freedom of information decisions, and there will also be, through the Information Commissioner, the possibility of review of all of the processes of FOI within the government, which will go a great distance towards what should be the true aim of a freedom of information regime, which is to create a culture in which governments and government departments and agencies are encouraged to release information. It should not be thought that freedom of information can ever be left completely to some code which lists in a prescriptive way the means and opportunities for obtaining information; rather, there should be a vibrant culture of release of information, where at all possible—a proactive culture of making information available—and it should not be left for citizens to make requests in order for information to be made available.</para>
<para>The
<inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill
</inline>starts with what I would suggest is a very, very substantial reform, and that is to replace the objects of the Freedom of Information Act with a new provision. It is a very important provision because it makes clear that access to information is a right and makes clear that there are requirements on agencies to publish information. It makes clear that this parliament intends to promote representative democracy by increasing public participation in government processes by increasing scrutiny, discussion, comment and review of the government’s activities and, as well, by increasing recognition that information held by the government is to be managed for public purposes and is a national resource. It is important that that kind of object be stated right at the outset of legislation like this so as to put beyond doubt any suggestion that the Freedom of Information Act is intended to be in some sense restrictive or in any way intended to fully describe the opportunities that are provided for access to government information. Rather, it needs to be understood that an FOI regime, and in particular the freedom of information regime of this Commonwealth, is a tool—it is something that is there to assist in better government and assist citizens to participate in the government of the Commonwealth.</para>
<para>The specific other provisions I would comment on, apart from the objects clause, include the tidying up, if I can call it that, of the exemption provisions, which is important because anything that can assist in making this legislation easier to read and simpler to use is to be commended. There is a set of provisions which will now require the publication of a range of information, as well as provisions which specify how and when information is to be published by agencies of the Commonwealth and encourage the provision of such access.</para>
<para>There are further amendments in relation to the form of public interest test which is weighted towards disclosure. This is something that will, again, assist in ensuring that proper consideration is given to requests for information. The Victorian freedom of information legislation has for many years contained reference to public interest, which operates in that legislation as a form of override or reason why, despite an exemption having been made out, documents ought to be released because the public interest requires such access. The Commonwealth legislation will through these amendments now include clear public interest provisions which include a set of factors that will favour access, including promoting the objects of the act, to which I have already referred, informing debate about matters of public importance, promoting effective oversight of public expenditure or allowing a person to access his or her own personal information.</para>
<para>What is also important is that this public interest test makes clear that a range of matters are not to be taken into account in a public interest assessment. They include whether or not access to a document would result in embarrassment to the Commonwealth government or cause a loss of confidence in the government. I repeat: that is a factor not to be taken into account in a public interest assessment. Further, and this is a matter that has been sometimes raised by government agencies in resisting disclosure, it puts to rest the suggestion that access to the document resulting in any person misinterpreting or misunderstanding the document could ever be a relevant factor. That too will not be something that is taken into account in public interest considerations. There are two more factors which are not to be taken into account in the public interest evaluation. The first is that the author of the document is or was of high seniority in the agency to which the request for access is made. That is ruled out as something that might be taken into account in a public interest matter. Secondly, ruled out from consideration in the public interest evaluation is the proposition that access to the document could result in confusion or unnecessary debate.</para>
<para>This is a piece of legislation which puts trust in the citizens of Australia. It rests on the proposition that political debate in this country and the participation of citizens in the government of this country will be assisted by the provision of information—and the more the better. That is why we see this sort of provision, which says no-one in future will be allowed to go and suggest in the review processes, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or before the Information Commissioner or to the Federal Court of Australia, that simply because the release of the document might result in confusion or unnecessary debate that would be a reason in the public interest for it not to be released—and so it should be, because that judgment, as to whether or not the release of a document might result in confusion or unnecessary debate, is an extraordinarily subjective judgment. I, as someone who has participated in more freedom of information cases than I care to remember, can say that I am very pleased to see that argument, as a reason for not allowing the release of a document, put to rest.</para>
<para>It is, of course, the case that the public interest underlies many of the exemptions. We have a clear public interest in refusing to release national security documents. We have a clear public interest in refusing to release documents that are sourced from the intelligence community. The way in which the new public interest provisions work recognises that there are competing public interests and that there are public interests which favour nondisclosure as well as public interests which favour disclosure. This proposed act contains a rebalancing of the provisions which were there before in a clearer way and will lead—and this is what the coalition has failed to recognise—to a system that promotes disclosure and a system in which information will be more accessible.</para>
<para>I end by again referring to the claims that have been repeatedly made—the ones that were recently made in the Senate committee process by Senator Brandis and other coalition senators and were made throughout last year by Senator Brandis—about the coalition’s supposed commitment to open and responsible government. They are laughable claims. Their failure to implement the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Administrative Review Council’s recommendations from 1996 speak for themselves. That failure shows the true commitment.

<para>—I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, for the call—a busy day in the parliament and we are looking forward to another session of the parliament later this evening. I recognise that the members of the Left Right Think-Tank, Australia’s first think tank for young Australians, are here in parliament today for the budget. They will, of course, be interested in the bill on freedom of information that we are discussing. That certainly interests young people as well as interesting the rest of the Australian population. To the member for Isaacs: I could not agree more with your contribution. I think we will probably hear more of the same from the member for Moreton in due course—a very fine Queenslander, I might add.</para>

<para>—People do not understand that there can be good friendships with those on the other side of the parliament. I remain a little bit cynical, though, I am afraid, about this particular bill and I am going to go through it and outline why I remain cynical. I will challenge the member for Isaacs over his comments about Senator Brandis and reflect on what is currently the situation within the Australian government.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I think we all agree with the purpose of the
<inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009</inline>. It is to amend the FOI Act 1982 to ‘usher in a new regime for access to government information’. How could you disagree with that? It is an absolutely laudable object. The second object of the bill is to ‘promote a pro-disclosure attitude’. I hope that the bureaucracy of the government departments out there hears this loud and strong and clear, because that is what we need. This bill is intended to deliver more effective and efficient access to government information and promote a culture of disclosure across government. But let us have a look at what is happening at the moment, and I will give you a case study: the Department of Defence. Never have I seen a more paranoid department. It does not matter what you ask of the department as the answer is, ‘No, we can’t tell you.’ Their attitude goes completely against the grain of the philosophy of this bill and it has got to change.</para>
<para>I will give the parliament a specific example. Defence is normally considered a bipartisan operation and all of us are very mindful of the work that the members of the ADF do for our country. We are all supportive of the Defence Force. I am particularly supportive because, within Australia, I have the largest defence concentration in my electorate in Townsville with the Army at Lavarack Barracks and the Air Force at RAAF Townsville. It is a very, very significant base and Australia’s most modern base. I take a keen interest in defence. I look after the people in the Defence Force.</para>
<para>When issues arise in Afghanistan and the media finds something and blows it up out of all proportion and you know that what they are saying is wrong, you want to stand up for the men and women of the ADF in your electorate and you want to give the media information that is correct. So what do you do? You ring the media ops section of Defence at Russell in Canberra. There are probably 100 employees in media ops. It is called Defence public affairs as well. You say, ‘This is what the papers are saying. I know this not to be true. Give me a couple of lines that I can use in the media to defend the Australian Defence Force in Townsville.’ Their answer is, ‘Look, I’m sorry, we can’t talk to you.’ They know that I am not going to misuse any information and that I need information for the right reasons. I explain that carefully and the answer is no, we cannot tell you. Then they say, ‘You have to ask the minister.’ I have been down that process a number of times. What happens when you ask the minister, effectively, is that you put a request in writing to the minister’s office for information. It will take days if not weeks to get a response. And by the time it comes through the issue has long gone.</para>
<para>In the last instance I said to Defence public affairs, ‘You’re there to look after the public, to provide information, that is your role. Here I am. I’m a member of parliament but I’m also a member of the public and I want to stand up for the Defence Force. Give me information and give me information that won’t embarrass anybody.’ But the answer keeps coming back—no. In this particular instance when I was defending the men and women from Townsville who had been to Afghanistan and were accused of drug related issues in Afghanistan and I knew it to be wrong I said to Defence, ‘In half an hour I’ve got to front the television cameras and I’ve got to give an explanation. Give me a couple of lines. I want to support the Defence Force.’ The answer was no. I said, ‘Are you saying that you’re going to just turn me loose and I could be wrong in what I say?’ They said, ‘Yep, we can’t do anything about it.’</para>
<para>It is that kind of paranoia that Defence has. People want to do good things for the Defence Force and need correct information that Defence has and could give them but does not. It is that kind of culture that departments have to take notice of. It cannot go on being a secret society, particularly when we are all trying to do the right thing. It is wrong that that should happen. How can you have a Defence public affairs unit of 100 people who will not give you information? That kind of culture has to be addressed. I call on the Minister for Defence to have a look at that in relation to the object and philosophy of the bills that we are talking about tonight.</para>
<para>In the information commissioner bill there are three information commissioner appointments. There is the Information Commissioner, the FOI Commissioner and the Privacy Commissioner. I note that the Information Commissioner has the ultimate decision power should there be a disagreement. That is fine. The bill also gives the Information Commissioner a discrete function of advising the government on information management policy.</para>
<para>The Information Commissioner is to be assisted by an information advisory committee. That committee will be chaired by the Information Commissioner and will comprise senior executives from key agencies and other persons outside the government who have suitable experience or qualifications. That is a good thing. The advisory committee and hence the Information Commissioner’s advice to government will not be truly independent if the appointments of the advisory committee are not picked with balance in mind. That is my view. That is not in the bill, but I think it is self-explanatory. I hope that, in making appointments, the government is mindful of the need for balance.</para>
<para>In the freedom of information bill the member for Isaacs talked about some of the tests that will be applied to more exemption categories than is currently the case. That is a good thing. He talked about the public interest test to be added to the economy, research and personal information exceptions. I think that on both sides of the parliament we are pleased that you will no longer be able to use arguments to prevent the release of information like, for example, disclosure of documents could cause a loss of confidence in the government or cause embarrassment to the government. Well, three cheers. That is a very good step forward.</para>
<para>I am pleased to see the bill also gives weighting to the FOI applicant. Should there be a disagreement between the three commissioners then the FOI applicant wins. That is interesting, though, as it contradicts the philosophy that the Information Commissioner has the ultimate say over the FOI and privacy commissioners.</para>
<para>I would like to turn to the history of FOI in Queensland, and the member for Moreton will be interested in this as well. This is where I get a bit cynical. Back in the Fitzgerald days, around 1989, Queensland suffered a lot of corruption in the police force, and there were people like Don ‘Shady’ Lane and Brian Austin who got themselves into a bit of strife. There was a fellow called Jack Herbert—I am the member for Herbert, but there is no relation—and there were some goings-on that were looked at. The inquiry handed its report to the government in Queensland in 1989. The report said:</para>
<quote>
<para>A Government can deliberately obscure the processes of public administration and hide or disguise its motives. If not discovered there are no constraints on the exercise of political power. The rejection of constraints is likely to add to power of the Government and its leader, and perhaps lead to an increased tendency to misuse of power.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I say hooray to that—it is dead right. In this context, from what the report said, it is easy to see the fundamental importance of proper record keeping by public servants so that the activities and decisions of government can be scrutinised by the public. Importantly, Fitzgerald saw that effective FOI laws were one of the accountability mechanisms necessary for a robust democracy, and we are recognising that in this bill in the parliament tonight.</para>
<para>The recent history in Queensland is fascinating because in September 2007, within days of Anna Bligh becoming the Premier, cabinet approved the terms of reference for a broad-ranging review of FOI, and the independent panel that resulted from that delivered its report in Queensland in June 2008. In answer to the question—this is a general finding—of whether FOI in Queensland had brought about a ‘major philosophical and cultural shift in the institutions of government and the democratisation of information in the last 15 years’, the review said no. I think we all suspected that.</para>
<para>Since that review, Queensland has gone down the track of what we are doing here in the Australian parliament tonight. The Queensland government made a commitment to provide access to information held by the government unless, on balance, it is contrary to the public interest to provide that information. The review on Queensland’s Freedom of Information Act found that a new approach was needed from the government, putting forward 141 recommendations for reform. The Queensland government then proceeded to enact those changes.</para>
<para>But what is the result of that? This is where, I guess, we all get cynical. A media release from the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland dated 25 November 2009 is headed ‘Accountability a joke under Bligh’—and this is what I have feared. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Premier Bligh is living in a fool’s paradise if she thinks her government is setting the national agenda for accountability.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… Premier Bligh’s claim in state parliament this morning that Queensland’s Right to Information legislation made her government more accountable was laughable. Anyone who has attempted to extract information from this government using RTI processes is confronted with bureaucratic obfuscation …</para>
<para class="block">“Under Bligh’s self-flaunted legislation, departments are required to respond 25 days but are either unable or unwilling to do so.”</para>
<para class="block">“The most recent request from the opposition office seeking information regarding the Bligh Labor Government’s negotiations with A1GP was met with a reciprocal request for an extension until 11 March 2010, more than three months after the designated due date.”</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These are the kinds of things that, as members of parliament, on both sides, we have to be very careful about. FOI has to mean FOI. After this bill goes through the parliament, if we see what is happening in Queensland continue to happen in the Australian departments, it will be a sad day for Australia. It will be a sad day for the aspirations that the member for Isaacs articulated so well in the parliament this evening. I accept that he is genuine in what he feels, and I think that all of us would want to see these kinds of aspirations delivered on by the Australian government and by the departments and bureaucracy in the Australian government so that Australia can be a better place and the people of Australia can be better informed.</para>
<para>Finally, I would just like to thank Alec Zeglis, who is with us tonight, for helping me prepare this contribution to the parliament. Alec is another fine young Australian who, one day, will be one of Australia’s leaders. Well done, Alec. Thank you.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Herbert for those kind words at the start of his speech and for his contribution. In a spirit of good democracy and open and accountable government, I rise to voice my strong support for the
<inline ref="R4164">Information Commissioner Bill 2009</inline>
and
<inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009</inline>. Australian democracy, like all democracy, relies on government being transparent to our people and institutions like the media to hold us accountable. Without this vital transparency, even historical and substantial democracies can breed secrecy and corruption. Without daylight, good government festers. We are lucky to have a history of continuous democracy. Nearly every country around the world has had blights on their democratic processes. We can look at the fascism that has arisen in Europe, the coups d’etat of Africa and the revolutions of South America, and even the United States has had civil wars, McCarthyism and other blights on its democratic processes. In Chris Wallace-Crabbe’s poem
<inline font-style="italic">Terra Australis</inline>, he says of Australia:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">We are the final children of the earth</para>
<para class="block">Whom knowledge has not scarred—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">not ‘scared’ but ‘scarred’. Looking back to my darker days under the Bjelke-Petersen government, as mentioned by the member for Herbert, this was the reality for Queenslanders. It was not just in the police service; it also infected the democratic process and the elected officials. Thankfully, a few good men and women on both sides of politics had the courage to stand against corruption. Since the Fitzgerald inquiry in 1989 Queensland has thrived under progressive, open and accountable governments, and, as the member for Herbert mentioned, more can be done.</para>
<para>In July last year, 20 years on from the Fitzgerald report, Tony Fitzgerald gave a lecture at the Inaugural Griffith University Tony Fitzgerald Lecture. He stressed that a lot more could be done. I am going to take you to some of the comments he made. Before I do, I particularly want to commend some of those people involved—not only AJ Brown at Griffith University but people from 20 years earlier, such as Mike Ahern, a National Party minister and later Premier. I commend Mike Ahern for his courage and commitment to good government. He let the Fitzgerald inquiry take place. Mike Ahern is well known as a fundamentally decent man. Consequently, the Queensland that I grew up in completely changed. We have wonderful police officers now that are able to shine—people like Commissioner Bob Atkinson, who leads the police service in Queensland. He is surely one of the most honourable men I have ever met, an inspiration to all young police officers and young Queenslanders.</para>
<para>In his lecture last year, at the Inaugural Tony Fitzgerald Lecture, Tony Fitzgerald said that every generation has a duty to historical truth. He warned us in that lecture that, tacitly at least, Queenslanders were encouraged to forget the repression and corruption which had occurred and the social upheaval that had been involved in eradicating those injustices. Younger Queenslanders know little of that era, the Bjelke-Petersen era, and are largely ignorant of the possibility that history might be repeated. It is a salutary warning. He said that ethics are always tested by incumbency. As a Queenslander in the Commonwealth parliament, I look to what has happened in my Queensland at the state government level and some of the tests that are put in front of elected officials.</para>
<para>The last point from the Fitzgerald lecture that I will make is the following quote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Unfortunately, cynical, short-sighted political attitudes adopted for the benefit of particular politicians and their parties commonly have adverse consequences for the general community.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those sentiments from Tony Fitzgerald, while particularly pointed, have a particular relevance for the Rudd government, peopled as it is by so many Queenslanders. That has informed the legislation that is before the House. Government cover-up and secrecy breed cynicism in the community, and obviously the last thing that we need is more cynicism about politics. We have to work hard to protect the integrity of our democracy. It is an often used quote, but the price of democracy is eternal vigilance.</para>
<para>That is why the Rudd government made an election commitment to restore trust and integrity to our political system, not only in the area of political donations and gifts but also by improving laws concerning freedom of information. We have already removed the power of ministers to issue conclusive certificates to refuse access to certain documents through FOI. Instead, all decisions to claim exemptions will be subject to a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para>
<para>The bills before the House represent the biggest change to FOI since it was introduced way back in 1982, 29 years ago. That was back when Malcolm Fraser was the Prime Minister, back when Malcolm Fraser was a liberal with a capital ‘l’ rather than the liberal with a small ‘l’ that he seems to be now. To take you back—and I know that you are too young to remember this, Deputy Speaker Bird—<inline font-style="italic">Eye of the Tiger</inline>
was No. 1 for about six weeks and Channel 9’s
<inline font-style="italic">Today Show</inline>
had its very first airing back in 1982, and it is still going strong.
<inline font-style="italic">Chariots of Fire</inline>
had won the Oscar for best picture and Michael Jackson’s
<inline font-style="italic">Thriller</inline>
had just been released. That contextualises the time in which FOI came about. We need to revisit the motives behind that legislation.</para>
<para>Through the bills before the chamber, we are further reforming the FOI Act to ensure that the right of access to documents is only limited where a stronger public interest lies in withholding access to those documents. Specifically, the public interest test states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The agency or Minister must give the person access to the document if it is conditionally exempt at a particular time unless (in the circumstances) access to the document at that time would, on balance be contrary to the public interest.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This legislation also lists the factors which must not be taken into account in deciding the public interest test. These include whether: access to the document could embarrass the Commonwealth, the document could be misinterpreted or misunderstood, the author of the document is of high seniority within the agency and the document could result in confusion or unnecessary debate. Some of the factors which would favour disclosure under the act include where the document would: inform debate on a matter of public importance; promote effective oversight of public expenditure, which is always important; and allow a person to access his or her own personal information.</para>
<para>As well as providing greater freedom of access to requested documents, the legislation heralds a new era of proactive disclosure. There is a term that people probably will not be rushing to have tattooed on their shoulders—‘proactive disclosure’ is probably not as catchy as ‘detailed programmatic specificity’, but it is an important term. Australian government agencies will have new obligations to proactively publish information, including: details of statutory appointments, information an agency routinely gives access to in response to requests under part 3 of FOI, information that is routinely provided to the parliament and certain operational information about an agency’s functions or powers in making decisions affecting members of the public.</para>
<para>While the overall intent of these bills is to provide greater access to government information, it does include two necessary and completely understandable exclusions relating to intelligence information. Intelligence agencies are already wholly excluded from the FOI Act. However, under this legislation extracts or summaries from intelligence agency documents such as ministerial briefings will also be excluded. Nevertheless, the Department of Defence ministers and agencies will be excluded only for information relating to the collection, reporting or analysis of operational intelligence. There is a general appreciation throughout the community that there is some government information that, for the sake of Australia’s security and safety, is better off under lock and key.</para>
<para>Next, fees for lodging FOI applications will also be abolished. Applicants will not pay for any charges for accessing their own personal information. Journalists and not-for-profit groups will not pay for the first five hours of decision making and all other applications will be charged after the first hour of decision making. This will ensure that as many people as possible can access information at the lowest possible cost. This legislation also brings forward the open access period for most records under the Archives Act from 30 years to 20 years and for cabinet notebooks from 50 years to 30 years. I look forward to 2040.</para>
<para>The Information Commissioner Bill 2009 will establish the Office of the Information Commissioner. This new Commonwealth agency will be headed by a new statutory officer called the Time Lord—sorry; just fooling with
<inline font-style="italic">Doctor Who</inline>
fans! The officer will be called the Information Commissioner. The commissioner will be responsible for all the functions and powers under the FOI Act and the Privacy Act, bringing these together under the one office for the first time. The Privacy Commissioner and the new FOI Commissioner will support the Information Commissioner. They will be responsible for: issuing guidelines on the administration of the FOI Act, because anybody who has ever been tangled up in red tape knows that the devil is always in the detail; investigating government agency compliance with the FOI Act; reporting on compliance with and operation of the FOI Act; administrating the training of staff; and reviewing decisions by agencies and ministers who refuse access to documents. This will include a new two-step review process. The first review will be conducted by the Information Commissioner. If not resolved, a second review will be done by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</para>
<para>As I said, these bills implement the biggest reform to FOI since it was introduced nearly 30 years ago. We are doing this because we want to make it easier for people to access information and to promote greater openness and transparency in government. For governments, freedom of information is a bit like going to the dentist. It might be a little bit painful, but you know that you are better off for it in the long run. We know that our democracy will be better for these changes. Unfortunately, under the coalition some people’s experience in trying to gain access to documents through freedom of information was a little bit like pulling teeth. We in the Rudd government believe that our achievements and our shortcomings should be on the record for all to see so that people can make an informed decision about our administration. We also believe that open government is better government. The singer Paul Kelly said, ‘I was born in a luck country and every day I hear the warning bells.’ This legislation before the chamber will help us all to hear the bells long before they toll for democracy. I commend the bills to the House.</para>

<para>A strategy that will see the budget return to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of schedule, and ahead of every major advanced economy.</para>
<para>A strategy that will pay off debt three years sooner—again, ahead of every major advanced economy—without increasing taxes as a share of the economy beyond the level we inherited from our predecessors.</para>
<para>This is a budget that moves from supporting the economy through the slowdown to
bringing us back to surplus now that we are recovering strongly.</para>
<para>A budget that produces an economic and fiscal position the envy of the developed world, and a stronger, more secure future for all Australians.</para>
<para class="bold">Economic outlook</para>
<para>We do not easily forget this time last year, when we faced the grimmest set of global economic conditions since the Great Depression.</para>
<para>Last year, around $60 billion was stripped from our export earnings and company profits fell more sharply than in the 1990s recession.</para>
<para>Our two‑stage strategy was to support jobs, then lay down a framework to bring the budget back to surplus as the economy recovered.</para>
<para>Tonight I am proud to announce this strategy is working, ensuring our economy has
far outperformed the rest of the developed world.</para>
<para>Advanced economies contracted by over three per cent in 2009, while Australia grew by 1.4 per cent. Without stimulus, we would have gone backwards by 0.7 per cent that year.</para>
<para>Last budget we expected our economy to contract in 2009-10 by half a per cent. Instead it will grow by around two per cent.</para>
<para>Last budget the unemployment rate was rising and forecast to peak at 8½ per cent. Instead it peaked at 5.8 per cent and is now on its way down to 4¾ per cent.</para>
<para>Last budget projected a return to surplus in 2015-16. We now expect a surplus in three years, three years ahead of schedule.</para>
<para>Together, Australians have defied global economic gravity; not by accident but by choice.</para>
<para>Together, we have avoided the destruction of skills and capital by keeping people in jobs and the economy ticking over.</para>
<para>Fiscal stimulus, monetary policy, a well-supervised banking system and our close ties with Asia all served to protect our country.</para>
<para>But events in Greece remind us risks in the global economy do stubbornly endure.</para>
<para>Aftershocks from the crisis continue to reverberate around parts of the world.</para>
<para>The robustness of this budget forms a solid buffer against the troubles of Europe.</para>
<para>Our economy and fiscal position remain among the strongest in the world. We have more robust growth, lower unemployment and lower debt than our peers.</para>
<para>Our economy is expected to rebound powerfully, with forecast real GDP growth of 3¼ per cent in 2010-11 and four per cent in 2011-12.</para>
<para>Best of all, the unemployment rate is expected to fall further from 5.3 per cent today to 4¾ per cent by mid-2012, around the level consistent with full employment.</para>
<para>The Australian economy is today in an important transition phase.</para>
<para>Fiscal stimulus is winding back as planned.</para>
<para>Business profits are recovering.</para>
<para>The private sector is re-emerging as a driver of growth.</para>
<para>And we are taking steps now to maximise our opportunities for the future.</para>
<para class="bold">An agenda for the future</para>
<para>While economic circumstances have changed significantly over the past year, the magnitude of our policy challenges has not.</para>
<para>Our goal is to manage the years ahead as decisively and successfully as in the year just passed.</para>
<para>So this budget targets three key challenges: the return to full capacity in a two-speed economy; climate change; and the fiscal pressures of an ageing population.</para>
<para>Tonight I am outlining a reform agenda to help tackle these challenges.</para>
<para>A reform agenda which will create jobs and encourage investment; boost renewable energy; build capacity; save for the future; and fund better health and hospitals.</para>
<para>All part of a fiscal strategy that allows us to ease the cost of living for working families while still getting back to surplus three years ahead of schedule.</para>
<para>Those looking for a big-spending pre-election budget won’t find one.</para>
<para>Instead we are maximising our opportunities—keeping Australia ahead of the pack, just as we were ahead of the pack in dealing with the global recession.</para>
<para class="bold">Growing the whole economy</para>
<para>The resources boom presents enormous opportunities and challenges.</para>
<para>Booms are not a permanent part of the economic landscape even if they might be expected to run for a decade or more.</para>
<para>That is why we need to manage our resource wealth sustainably—capturing a fairer share for all Australians and turning it into other forms of wealth that last.</para>
<para>That is why we are introducing a Resource Super Profits Tax from 1 July 2012.</para>
<para>This will reduce the tax burden on less profitable resource projects and projects in their early stages, supporting greater resource sector investment and more production.</para>
<para>It will also ensure our community charges a fairer price for our finite resources.</para>
<para>The revenue we raise will be directed to strengthen and broaden the whole economy, to invest in our productive capacity, and to boost our national savings.</para>
<para>Taxing mining super profits fairly means we can afford to cut the company tax rate to 29 per cent in 2013-14 and 28 per cent in 2014-15.</para>
<para>This will boost our competitiveness, expand investment and job opportunities, and spread the benefits of the boom more broadly, to more working families.</para>
<para>Our focus in this budget is on helping small business, financial services, and the renewable energy sectors thrive.</para>
<para>From 2012-13, small businesses will receive a head start on the 28 per cent company tax rate. They will enjoy an instant write-off for assets costing less than $5,000, and a simple but generous depreciation pool for other assets.</para>
<para>Tonight’s budget also delivers on our commitment to position Australia as a leading financial services hub in our region.</para>
<para>A phase-down in interest withholding tax, reforms to promote a deep and liquid corporate bond market, arrangements to promote cross-border marketing of managed funds, and a new Centre for International Finance and Regulation will all help us capitalise on the strengths of our financial services sector.</para>
<para class="bold">Investing in renewable energy</para>
<para>Climate change remains a core challenge for the future—for this nation, and for all nations.</para>
<para>This government accepts the science of climate change and the need for combined global and domestic action.</para>
<para>That’s why we have accepted a target range of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by between five and 25 per cent by 2020.</para>
<para>We sought to pass our Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through this parliament this year because it is the cheapest and most effective way of tackling climate change.</para>
<para>As we continue to work to build the necessary domestic and international consensus for carbon markets, we will roll out the most substantial renewable energy plan this country has seen—consistent with our decision to increase the renewable energy target to 20 per cent by 2020.</para>
<para>We have already committed support for energy efficiency, renewable technologies and clean coal of over $10 billion.</para>
<para>Tonight I announce the next step—a new $652 million Renewable Energy Future Fund, which will be part of an expanded $5.1 billion Clean Energy Initiative.</para>
<para>This fund will leverage private sector investment to support renewable energy projects, and the development and deployment of low-emissions technologies.</para>
<para>It will also be used to enhance Australia’s take-up of energy efficiency, including helping households and businesses reduce their energy consumption.</para>
<para class="bold">Building skills and infrastructure</para>
<para>We are also taking the necessary steps to expand our productive capacity, so we can grow sustainably with low inflation into the future.</para>
<para>Our main priority has shifted from soaking up idle capacity in the economy to building new capacity for the future.</para>
<para>Not long ago the Australian economy was facing skills shortages that were constraining growth and contributing to wage and price pressures.</para>
<para>Now, with some industry sectors and regions growing faster than others, labour demand will grow faster in some areas than others as our recovery gathers pace.</para>
<para>That is why I announce tonight a new Skills for Sustainable Growth strategy.</para>
<para>A strategy that will invest $661 million in the skills of our workforce and ensure our education and training systems are flexible and responsive to our economic needs.</para>
<para>A strategy that will deliver up to 70,000 new training places over the next four years, and support 22,500 young apprentices.</para>
<para>This includes critical investments in emerging skills hot spots, like infrastructure projects, the resources sector, and renewable energy.</para>
<para>In partnership with the states, it will deliver a guaranteed training place to people under 25 for their first qualification, or to raise their qualifications.</para>
<para>It will improve the quality and accessibility of training—strengthening the link between training and business needs.</para>
<para>And it will provide greater access to training in core foundation skills such as literacy and numeracy.</para>
<para>Infrastructure investment is a key driver of productivity.</para>
<para>This government is already more than doubling real expenditure on major transport infrastructure over the six years to 2013-14, compared to the six years before that.</para>
<para>But we know the resource rich states, in particular, have substantial infrastructure needs for their more rapidly growing economies.</para>
<para>That is why proceeds from the RSPT will create a new infrastructure fund.</para>
<para>The fund will grow over time, with estimated inflows of more than $5.6 billion over the next decade, beginning with $700 million in 2012-13.</para>
<para>In addition, I am announcing an equity investment of $1 billion in the Australian Rail Track Corporation to fund productivity-enhancing rail freight works across Australia.</para>
<para>The government has also committed $71 million towards the development of an intermodal terminal precinct at Moorebank in Sydney.</para>
<para>The terminal will improve the flow of international and domestic trade, expanding freight handling capacity in Sydney and alleviating congestion around Port Botany.</para>
<para>The National Broadband Network represents a quantum leap in the way Australia communicates, works, and does business.</para>
<para>The government has made appropriate provision in the budget for the roll-out of NBN, subject to a final response to the implementation study.</para>
<para>The investments we are making in infrastructure and our changes to the tax system will create a stronger economy.</para>
<para>The RSPT, including the effective removal of royalties, and a lower company tax rate will strengthen the business case for new investment, including in the mining sector.</para>
<para>Independent modelling indicates economy-wide investment will be boosted by 2.1 per cent in the long run.</para>
<para>Our role as the government is also to provide an efficient and certain regulatory framework under which the private sector can invest with confidence.</para>
<para>That is why we asked Infrastructure Australia to develop a National Infrastructure Pipeline that helps give major investors, like super funds, the certainty they need to commit resources to infrastructure investment.</para>
<para class="bold">Saving for the future</para>
<para>Our superannuation changes will boost national savings, support investment and help give Australians the financial security they deserve in retirement.</para>
<para>The staged increase in the super guarantee and our equity measures for low-income earners are major investments in the long-term adequacy of retirement savings.</para>
<para>Tonight, I am announcing additional measures that will help boost savings outside of the superannuation system.</para>
<para>We recognise bank deposits are a preferred savings vehicle for many Australians.</para>
<para>Right now, there is considerable variation in the taxation treatment of alternative savings vehicles.</para>
<para>While interest is taxed at the saver’s marginal rate without any discount, capital gains on assets held longer than a year receive a 50 per cent discount.</para>
<para>We know this particularly disadvantages lower-wealth and older savers who are more likely to hold their non-superannuation savings in interest-bearing products.</para>
<para>So from 1 July 2011 Australians will be able to obtain a 50 per cent tax discount for the first $1,000 of interest they earn, including interest earned on deposits held in banks, building societies and credit unions, and on bonds, debentures and annuity products.</para>
<para>This change is expected to make interest-bearing products more attractive to savers, which will have positive flow-on effects for competition in our financial system.</para>
<para class="bold">Better health and hospitals</para>
<para>The ageing of our population and rising health costs pose a long-term challenge for our nation.</para>
<para>Total healthcare expenditure is projected to more than double as a share of the economy over the next 40 years.</para>
<para>That is why this government is putting so much effort into reforming our health and hospital system.</para>
<para>This budget builds on our
National Health and Hospitals Network—a
major economic reform with the simple goal of better hospitals and better health for every Australian.</para>
<para>Tonight I am announcing a further $2.2 billion investment in the health system.</para>
<para>This takes our new investment to $7.3 billion over five years, and $23 billion over the rest of the decade.</para>
<para>We make these investments because we believe Australians deserve high quality, accessible health care.</para>
<para>We believe Australians deserve to be able to see a GP whenever they need one, particularly late at night or on a weekend.</para>
<para>That is why I am announcing a $772 million investment in our GPs and primary care services.</para>
<para>This will provide better access to GPs after hours and establish Medicare Locals—ensuring every Australian has the access and advice they need locally.</para>
<para>It will fund upgrades to around 425 GP and primary care clinics across the nation and deliver 23 new GP superclinics.</para>
<para>We believe nurses play a vital role in our hospitals and our communities and we have listened to their concerns.</para>
<para>That is why I am announcing $523 million to train and support our nurses, including in aged care and in our rural and regional communities.</para>
<para>We believe the delivery of healthcare services should be transformed.</para>
<para>So tonight I am announcing $467 million to modernise our health system by providing a personally controlled electronic health record for every Australian who wants one.</para>
<para>This will mean patients and their doctors will have their health records at their fingertips—improving patient safety and health care delivery.</para>
<para>We believe in better planning of our aged care workforce.</para>
<para>That is why we have asked the Productivity Commission to inquire into aged care, and why we will undertake more research into staffing levels, skills and resident care needs.</para>
<para>Combined with the agreement reached at COAG, our investments will deliver better health care, better hospitals, more doctors, more nurses and more beds.</para>
<para>These are landmark reforms—the biggest since the introduction of Medicare—and they are fully funded over the forward estimates.</para>
<para>We have taken responsibility for our health and hospital system and we are delivering our improvements in a financially responsible way in this budget.</para>
<para class="bold">Easing the cost of living</para>
<para>In safeguarding the economy and jobs during the global downturn I am proud we also delivered greater financial security for families, pensioners and carers.</para>
<para>Infrastructure investments across the country, and direct payments under our stimulus packages, boosted confidence and helped keep the economy ticking over.</para>
<para>We are also delivering other significant initiatives to help Australians make ends meet.</para>
<para>With the new tranche of personal tax cuts from 1 July, we will have delivered $47 billion in tax relief over four years, targeted squarely at working families.</para>
<para>We will have increased the effective tax-free threshold from $11,000 in 2007-08 to $16,000 in 2010-11 through increases in the low-income tax offset.</para>
<para>Working families have also benefited substantially from the increase in the child-care rebate, the education tax refund, and the Teen Dental Plan.</para>
<para>We are improving the first home saver accounts to help address the housing affordability challenge faced by so many young Australians.</para>
<para>For age pensioners we have delivered an historic increase in pensions and benefits.</para>
<para>Our key business tax reforms will increase real wages by around 1.1 per cent in the long run, putting an extra $450 a year into the pockets of workers on average earnings.</para>
<para>The tax cuts and other initiatives in this budget continue to ease the cost-of-living burden carried by working families.</para>
<para>But the families I speak to right around the country do not just want more financial security; they also want more time with each other.</para>
<para>So the government has decided to provide taxpayers the choice of a standard deduction instead of the hassle of shoeboxes full of receipts and the costs of professional assistance.</para>
<para>This means less time with the Tax Pack, more time with the loved ones, and for 6.4 million Australians it means a bigger tax refund.</para>
<para>The standard deduction will be phased in over two years so that $500 will be available from 1 July 2012, increasing to $1,000 from 1 July 2013.</para>
<para>This is a key step towards a ‘tick and flick’ system of pre-filled tax returns that will make life easier for working families at tax time.</para>
<para class="bold">Responsible fiscal strategy</para>
<para>Tonight we deliver all of these initiatives and still achieve the most rapid fiscal consolidation since at least the 1960s.</para>
<para>Our strategy will see us return to surplus in three years, three years ahead of schedule.</para>
<para>The budget deficit of $40.8 billion for 2010-11 is almost $6 billion less than the forecast at MYEFO and $16 billion less than expected one year ago.</para>
<para>We are meeting our commitment to restrain growth in real spending to two per cent in above-trend growth terms.</para>
<para>We have offset all new spending over the forward estimates, including an extra $1.5 billion for defence operations, and significant funding for border security.</para>
<para>Our increase in the tobacco excise is not popular; but it helps us fund our health commitments.</para>
<para>And our reforms to medicines pricing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and a new community pharmacy agreement, will deliver $2.5 billion in net savings over five years from 2010-11 and provide better value for money for taxpayers.</para>
<para>Not one single pre-election budget of the former government delivered net savings over the forward estimates. This one does.</para>
<para>I also announce tonight an extension of our fiscal strategy. A new phase, focused on building even stronger surpluses and paying off debt even quicker.</para>
<para>The government will maintain the two per cent annual cap on real spending growth, on average, until the surplus reaches one per cent of GDP.</para>
<para>On current projections, this would be achieved in 2015-16.</para>
<para>We will pay off debt three years ahead of schedule, after reaching a peak of just 6.1 per cent of GDP in 2011-12, or $93.7 billion in 2012-13 in dollar terms.</para>
<para>This is half what we expected a year ago and less than one-tenth of the average peak expected across the major advanced economies.</para>
<para class="bold">Facing the future with confidence</para>
<para>It is a tribute to every Australian that, tonight, we face our challenges from a position of strength, and not sifting through the rubble of recession.</para>
<para>Were it not for our shared successes we could not afford to boost national savings or invest in skills, infrastructure, renewable energy and hospitals.</para>
<para>To all Australians I say our job now is to convert the economic achievements of the past year into enduring gains for our economy and for our people.</para>
<para>We have great advantages, and we also have a spring in our step.</para>
<para>We face the future with confidence but not with complacency.</para>
<para>We can maximise our opportunities if we dedicate ourselves to the reform task as diligently as we dedicated ourselves to the task of saving jobs during the downturn.</para>
<para>If we do, there is no reason we cannot be the envy of the world over the coming years, just as we have been during the year just passed.</para>
<para>I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Radio broadcasting</inline>
</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">During May and June of 2009 the radio industry switched on digital radio services in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Consideration of the complex policy and planning issues involved in the regional rollout of digital radio is underway and engineering advice on spectrum requirements is being developed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government will conduct a review, by 2011, into alternative terrestrial and satellite digital radio technologies that may be appropriate for regional areas. This review will address the fact that the digital radio technology being used in metropolitan areas (known as Digital Audio Broadcasting Plus, DAB+) is unlikely to be able to replicate the extensive broadcast coverage of some regional AM services.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Digital television</inline>
</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On 5 January 2010, the Government announced that it would fund a new satellite service to provide digital television to viewers in remote licence areas and those in metropolitan and regional licence areas who are unable to receive the terrestrially-delivered digital television services provided by commercial broadcasters licensed for their area.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In addition to the full range of ABC and SBS digital television services, the satellite service will feature a range of commercial services equivalent to those available in metropolitan areas—this includes three core channels feature content from the Seven, Nine and Ten Networks plus digital multi-channels such as GO!, 7TWO and ONE HD. The satellite service will also provide eligible viewers with access to the local news and information regional commercial broadcasters provide their terrestrial licence areas.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On 18 March 2010, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010 (the Bill) was introduced into the House of Representatives. The Bill establishes the legislative framework for the commercial broadcasting digital television services that will be delivered as part of the new satellite service.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Bill also introduces measures to allow all commercial free-to-air digital television services, including digital multi-channels such as GO!, 7TWO and ONE HD, to be provided terrestrially to a small number of licence areas where historically there were fewer than two commercial broadcasters.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Bill amends the
<inline font-style="italic">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</inline>
to allow commercial broadcasters in regional South Australia, Griffith and Broken Hill to apply for a third, digital-only commercial licence giving them the opportunity to provide a full suite of digital television services in their licence area.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Convergence</inline>
</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Australians living in remote and rural areas are already able to access radio and television services on the Internet. Examples of such services could be online radio, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and video-on-demand services. These services are delivered by traditional broadcasters as well as new providers, and may be viewable on traditional platforms such as television sets as well as convergent devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs. The range of services available to consumers will increase consistent with improvements to broadband infrastructure from technology advancements and ongoing investment.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A key trend in the broadcasting sector is convergence, which refers to the merging of different forms of technology to provide the same services. The Government has flagged its intention to consider in 2011 whether to look again at its overall approach to regulation in a convergent environment in the
<inline font-style="italic">National Broadband Network: Regulatory Reform for 21st Century Broadband Discussion Paper</inline>
and the
<inline font-style="italic">Digital Economy: Future Directions</inline>
paper. A key theme in these considerations will be the scope for winding back industry-specific regulation once the National Broadband Network is firmly established as an open access, wholesale-only, national network. The Government has also indicated that it will look at a range of issues in this review such as media diversity, ownership controls, audience reach rules and local content obligations.</para>

<para>and (8) As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have had some engagement with representatives of Securency International Pty Ltd on the following occasions:</para>
<para>Securency Managing Director Mr Myles Curtis attended a dinner hosted by me on 26 August 2008 during a visit to Canberra by Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim. There were 21 attendees at the dinner including members of Minister Amorim’s party, Brazilian and Australian officials, and representatives of Australia’s business and other interests engaged with Brazil. Dinner guests were asked to speak briefly about their organisations’ engagement with Brazil and Mr Curtis spoke about Securency in that context.</para>
<para>I raised Securency with Indian Finance Minister Mr Chidambaram in New Delhi on 12 September 2008. Also present at the meeting were Australian and Indian officials. During the meeting, I asked about a possible trial of Securency polymer notes by the Indian Government. Mr Chidambaram responded that the Indian Government was considering whether a trial would proceed.</para>
<para>During a visit to Mexico, I attended a lunch hosted by the Australian Ambassador in Mexico City on 18 November 2008. At the lunch, I was introduced to a representative of Securency in Mexico, Dr Jaime Pacreu. There were some 25 people at the lunch, including Mexican Government officials, representatives of the private sector, including Australian companies active in Mexico, and members of the diplomatic corps.</para>
<para>During a visit to Santiago de Chile, on 27 August 2009 I attended an Australian Business Club reception at which I was introduced to a representative of Securency in Chile, Mr Guillermo Montt.

<para>There may have been other occasions that I have attended business-related functions at which representatives of Securency have been present.</para>

<para>Advice from Austrade assists this assessment, including information Austrade may hold in respect of Australian business registration details, the proportion of Australian ownership, and an assessment of the significance of the net return to Australia from the proposed activity.</para>
<para>Securency’s bona fides as an Australian company seeking support for its activities overseas had been established for some time. Ministers and officials of the Australian Government have been making representations on behalf of Securency since the mid-1990s. For example:</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Officials from the Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations delivered a statement on the human rights situation in Iran during Iran’s appearance before the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review Working Group in Geneva on 15 February 2010.

Australia also raised the human rights situation in Iran in our ‘item 4’ statements on country-specific situations of serious concern at each of the three UN Human Rights Council sessions in 2009, referring to Iran’s treatment of Baha’is as a specific concern.</para>

detailed the Government’s intent to make better use of ex-Regular ADF personnel and enhance the use of the Reserve including the High Readiness Reserves (HRR). The extension of the Graded Officer Pay Scale (GOPS) and Graded Other Rank Pay Scale (GORPS) to Reservists has increased the attractiveness of Active Reserve service to members separating from permanent service. Reserve conditions of service and employment will be reviewed as part of the Strategic Reform Program ‘Reserves Reform Stream’. The intended outcome is to maximise the transfer of separating full time ADF members to Reserves, lengthen the tenure of already trained Reserve members, and attract fresh Reserve members with required core or niche skill sets.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The Government recognises the concerns expressed by the veteran community regarding the indexation of military superannuation pensions. In acknowledgement of these concerns the Government commissioned an independent expert review—the Review of Pension Indexation Arrangements in Australian Government Civilian and Military Superannuation Schemes, conducted by Mr Trevor Matthews.</para>
<para>The review considered whether the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) indexation methodology for pensions for Australian Government civilian and military defined benefit superannuation schemes should be changed.</para>
<para>The report of the review, released on 21 August 2009, recommended no change to the indexation arrangements.</para>
<para>Mr Matthews recommended that pensions from the Australian Government civilian and military superannuation schemes continue to be indexed by the CPI as it is the most suitable index to protect pensions against inflationary price increases.</para>
<para>The Government fully supports the findings and recommendations of the report.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>Mr Matthews did not consider it inequitable or unfair that civilian and military superannuation pensions are increased on a different basis to the Age or Service Pensions. He considered that they are different benefits provided for different purposes and therefore can be increased on a different basis.</para>
<para>That is, Mr Matthews is drawing a distinction between the obligation of the State to provide an income support safety net to its more disadvantaged citizens and the obligation of the State (as an employer) to provide superannuation to its employees and former employees.</para>
<para>Mr Matthews considered that the CPI should be retained as the basis for indexation of civilian and military superannuation pensions, unless a better measure of changes in the cost of living for superannuants becomes available.</para>

<para>and (ii) The proposed expenditure of $28 million over the forward estimates and $69 million over the decade provide for the ongoing implementation of the Mortimer reforms. Examples of specific funding requirements include funding the General Manager Commercial position recommended by the Review, the recruitment of a specialist team to provide expert analysis of cost, schedule and risk implications of major project proposals and strengthening the customer supplier agreements between the Department of Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation.</para>

<para>The Mortimer (Procurement and Sustainment) stream is one of the ‘non-savings streams’ of the Strategic Reform Program. While direct cost savings are not anticipated, the blueprint document entitled “Strategic Reform Program: Delivering Force 2030” released by Defence on 4 June 2009 notes that the non-savings streams “will help to keep costs down through better quality planning, cost estimation and control”. The Mortimer reforms are a critical enabler of efficiencies in major Defence capital equipment acquisitions and in the through-life support of that equipment.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Pregnant visa applicants intending to deliver in Australia are tested for Hepatitis B. This is because Hepatitis B is a potentially serious viral infection that a mother may transmit to her baby at, or around the time of birth. Infants who are infected during birth are at high risk of becoming chronic carriers of the disease. This significantly increases their risk of developing chronic liver disease, which may cause premature death.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">If the mother is diagnosed with Hepatitis B before the baby is born, the newly born infant can receive appropriate immunisation in the delivery room.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Doctors, dentists, nurses and paramedics are required to be tested for Hepatitis B and C as well as HIV. All health care workers who have Hepatitis B or C or HIV are asked to confirm whether they will be performing certain procedures known as exposure prone procedures (EPPs). If their duties will include EPPs, the applicants will not meet health for the grant of a visa as they are considered a risk to public health.</para>

As you are aware, a key element of the Government’s $2.2 billion investment in the Digital Education Revolution (DER) is $2.1 billion for the National Secondary School Computer Fund (the Fund). The Fund will assist schools to provide for new ICT for secondary students in Years 9 to 12. The overall aim of the Fund is to achieve a 1:1 computer to student ratio for students in Years 9 to 12 in Australian secondary schools by 2011.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>Of the schools you requested information about, 14 currently enrol students in Years 9 to 12 and are eligible for assistance under the Fund. The table below provides information about the school, the number of computers approved through the application rounds of the Fund and the number of computers installed as at 15 March 2010.</para>

<para>Education authorities were provided funding of $1000 per computer required to reach a 1:2 computer to student ratio under the application rounds.

<para>Funding to reach a 1:1 ratio by December 2011 is now being provided on a per capita basis through a National Partnership with the Government sector and through Funding Agreements with the non-government sector.</para>
