                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I am delighted to continue my comments on this bill and to draw to the chamber's attention that it is always easy in 2017 to say, 'The North West Shelf is there. Gorgon, Wheatstone and Ichthys are there. The Queensland projects are there.' They were not always there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw attention to the chamber that back in the 1970s Sir Charles Court, the absolute dynamo of Western Australia and Australian industry, negotiated with the federal government that there be a fairer sharing of the royalties and the income that would come from the possibility of a North West Shelf. Remember, Woodside had made no investment. There was a prospectivity but there was no wealth. It is easy in this year to look back and say, 'Look how much money we have all made out of it,' and, 'We're rushing towards being the world's biggest exporter of LNG,' but in the 1970s there was nothing there. A huge risk was taken. Quite correctly, Sir Charles Court said to the Prime Minister of the day, 'We in Western Australia are going to take the risks. We're going to be doing the work. You will enjoy the royalty benefit of the LNG that might come'—might come!—'from the success of a North West Shelf.' As a result of that, a decision was taken at the time that should there be any gas and condensate found there would be no tax at all to the company on condensate to give them an incentive. That was done so that in the possibility of there being some success from that exploration they would at least have a motivation and an incentive. As we know, along came Prime Minister Rudd, and he put paid to what had been a long-established principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of this bill before us is that it takes into account the sharing of royalty income between the Commonwealth government and the state, or states. As we know, on the seabed hydrocarbons move. They might be in state waters. If they are within or around an island they may be in Commonwealth waters. As extraction takes place the hydrocarbons move. This is part of the reason for the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill coming before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am delighted that Senator Moore yesterday courteously supported this bill on behalf of her party. She made some very good points about resources and their contribution, and about the efforts in Western Australia of the member for the Pilbara, Mr Grylls, who would be absolutely torpedoing future investment—in that case in the iron ore industry—as a result of ill-founded and poorly thought out claims made for his own cheap, political advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the efforts of Charles Court and others the decision was taken at that time that there should be some preference for domestic gas supply. Why would that be? Simply because at that time the risk was on the people of Western Australia. Charles Court negotiated what was called a take or pay agreement—in other words, should Woodside proceed and should they find gas, then there would be an automatic market for that gas. At that time, of course—as I know myself—in WA there was no reticulated supply of gas. So the people of Western Australia and indeed Alcoa, the aluminium company themselves, took an undertaking that they would purchase in advance significant proportions of that natural gas. So today we have a scenario in place in WA where at least 15 per cent of all new LNG supply is guaranteed for domestic gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, I would humbly request through you that I have some silence or at least quiet if that is possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Yes. Could I just invite all senators if they are holding conversations and if they do not need to be in the chamber to hold those conversations outside the chamber so that we can hear Senator Back in silence. It is disruptive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BACK:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you very much. I would have liked to have contributed to how the UN went from my time in 2013. Maybe we can continue that discussion at a later stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was just concluding on the observation that in Western Australia now, as a result of the risk taken by the Western Australian community through the then-Premier Charles Court, that the risk associated with the development of North West Shelf Gas was taken by the people of WA and Alcoa. Of course, today it is wonderful. We have a Pilbara to Bunbury gas pipeline. Gas is reticulated everywhere. If states like Victoria and South Australia and Queensland do not get their act together in terms of gas exploration and extraction, there is already talk of there being huge storage facilities either offshore Victoria or on land to provide gas for Victoria from elsewhere. I had a discussion recently with our new ambassador to Japan, the Hon. Richard Court, son of Sir Charles. He and I discussed the prospect of whether there could indeed be a gas pipeline across the Nullarbor so that we could supply these other states who seem to be most intransigent when it comes to guaranteeing a supply of product that will guarantee to keep the lights on in those states. South Australia is already in a parlous state with its ill-founded decision to move towards a wind turbine dominated supply. My good colleague Senator Hume is kind enough to sit here and support me in this contribution. Already Victoria has discontinued or is discontinuing coal-fired power and Victoria will find itself in the same position that South Australia is in today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw to attention in relation to this whole question of the offshore gas that is the subject of this bill just how important is the scale of the operations that have been going on offshore WA and in Queensland onshore with the supply being exported from Gladstone. The two big projects of which the Chevron company is the major promoter, Gorgon on Barrow Island and Wheatstone at Exmouth, are together a $100 billion project, part of $200 billion of investment in Australia in LNG. Let me put it into perspective, if I may. In today's dollars the entire Snowy Mountains scheme is $8 billion. We quite rightly are very proud of the Snowy Mountains scheme, the time that was undertaken and the use of people displaced out of Europe. Snowy Mountain is of course a phenomenal project and is even today delivering hydroelectricity for which we should all have enormous hope in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Snowy Mountains scheme was an $8 billion project in 2016 dollars. Between them, Gorgon and Wheatstone are a $100 billion project. It is important to reflect on this, for those who seem for some reason or other to be dismissive of LNG and its contribution to the Australian economy. Let me share something with the chamber and with those who might be interested. I mentioned there was $200 billion of investment in LNG. That is a third of all investment coming into this country. In terms of revenue for government, oil and gas production and exploration in 2011-12 put $30 billion into the Australian economy, contributing two per cent. But as we move to being the world's largest exporter of LNG in 2018-19, that figure of $30 billion will increase to $65 billion of revenue by 2020. That represents 3½ per cent of Australia's GDP. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for all the allegations that the resources sector does not seem to make its contribution in company taxes et cetera, in 2011-12 the industry paid to the Australian government $8.8 billion in income tax, corporate taxes and resource royalties. But the news gets even better. By 2020—in only three years time—that $8.8 billion paid directly into the Australian economy increases to $12.8 billion; that is nearly $13 billion of income tax, corporate tax and royalties paid into our economy. What does that build? For example, that contribution would build six new state-of-the-art major teaching hospitals in cities or towns around Australia. I am often told, 'It doesn't contribute much by way of jobs.' There have been 103,000 jobs created. I see the minister for resources nodding his head. He now has, on behalf of the government and the people of Australia, the responsibility and the accountability to take that case for industry into this place. Over 100,000 high-paying jobs have been created, principally for Australians. I know of your support, Acting Deputy President Sterle, for the resources sector in our home state of Western Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it gets better than that. Yes, it is true that Gorgon, in terms of its establishment and construction, is coming to a close. It has three gas trains. Trains 1 and 2 are up and running now; train 3 will be by the end of this year. I was privileged, along with Mr Gary Gray, Ms Melissa Price from the electorate of Durack and others, to be on Barrow Island for the first shipment of LNG to leave Western Australia from the Gorgon project. At Wheatstone, there are two trains. One of them will be operating in full by the middle of this year; the other one will be by about the middle of next year. What is interesting is that, for the next 40 years, an LNG ship will leave Western Australian waters every 72 hours. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, it is the case that there is a petroleum resource rent tax. It is designed so that the costs of establishment—the exploration and bringing into production these huge projects—can be accounted for up-front and so that there is encouragement to invest and to continue to invest in this country. Yes, it is the case that there is then a delay in some of the returns to the federal government by way of royalties. But let me make two points. The first is that in Western Australia particularly—I cannot speak with any experience about Queensland—a lot of the gas reserves, whilst they are enormous, are marginal in terms of cost. I hope the minister is taking careful notes. Because they are marginal this is the incentive to go ahead and invest on the North West Shelf—Woodside with Pluto and Chevron with Gorgon and with Wheatstone—and the new facilities offshore: Scarborough and Browse. These are terms with which you are very familiar, Mr Deputy President Sterle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I want to make is that Australia is a very high-cost location into which investment can be made. Even the Gulf of Mexico is infinitely cheaper than Australia. The South China Sea and offshore Brazil are very attractive locations. I say to my colleagues who are making decisions at this time in terms of the review of the petroleum resource rent tax, 'For heaven's sake, do not bite the hand that feeds you.' I go back to the comment I made a moment ago. With just one company, Chevron, there will be an LNG ship every 72 hours for 40 years. We are all aware of the excellence of the North West Shelf—the work undertaken by Woodside at Rankin and North Rankin and more recently at Pluto. Woodside have the opportunity with Sunrise in the Timor Sea. They have the opportunity on the Browse Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come now to the outlook for the future and I refer to the new concept of floating LNG. We know of the enormous vessel—the largest vessel ever built by the Shell company in Korea—Shell <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span>. How is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude </span>project different? Shell have combined in the one floating structure their hundreds of years of expertise in shipping, the construction of LNG facilities and the conduct, maintenance and operation of LNG. This will be on their project offshore WA. Where is the excitement for us? This is a world first and it is in our patch. We have followed the rest of the world—Stavanger in Norway, Houston in Texas and Aberdeen in Scotland. This time around we are the first. Australia, Australians and Western Australians have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor in terms of the operation and conduct of the new Shell <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude </span>project. In the event that it succeeds we will see more floating structures. Why? Because, unlike a fixed structure, if and when supply runs out, you can move that vessel, that whole LNG platform, to a new location and continue well into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How exciting is this in our world? We have the capacity with our TAFE and higher education institutions in WA and indeed nationally to lead the world in this new floating LNG technology. Coming back to the bill that is before us, you can now understand the importance of this place legislating to ensure that, wherever that floating LNG structure is placed, we know in advance what the sharing will be in terms of revenue through royalties to the state and to the federal government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the few minutes left available to me I make a plea on behalf of Western Australia. These projects in the Pilbara are a long distance from Perth. We know that the community of WA has to invest heavily in roads, housing, schools and communities to support the people who run and operate these projects. In a scenario in which the royalty income comes back to the federal government for the benefit of all Australians there must be a provision for the people of the state who spend the money so that the overall community of Australia can benefit. That is the critically important point. We must think nationally but we must act locally so that we continue to attract, continue to see and continue to enjoy the benefits that will come to us over many years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point to be made is that today is the day on which the Woodside company will be launching their first ever LNG-powered PSV—a platform supply vessel—in Fremantle. It is more the pity that we cannot be there to enjoy it. It is the first time in the southern hemisphere. Of course, the big ships that operate backwards and forwards are themselves powered by LNG. It is a good luck story. I support this bill and I commend it to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:50</span>):  I and my colleagues in the chamber will support the second reading of this bill. I will be moving a second reading amendment that I will refer to shortly. We know that the structure of this bill is largely technical in nature. It aims to clarify the apportionment arrangements relating to certain petroleum deposits that straddle state and Commonwealth jurisdictions. That is in schedule 1 of the bill. Also, it aims to ensure the capacity of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, to refund fees paid to it where necessary. I will not go into the technical aspects of that, but these seem like sensible technical amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does give an important opportunity both at this stage and at the committee stage of this bill to discuss broader issues in terms of the crisis we face in this country in terms of energy security and also the issue of gas suppliers. We know from Manufacturing Australia that what they are paying for gas is just extraordinary. There is a constant debate in this country about whether there should be a gas reservation policy. We know that the Palaszczuk government in Queensland has recently announced changes so that any new leases or tenements need to have a proportion reserved for domestic use. I know that many economists and, I dare say, the minister responsible will say that is the case. I mean that the minister in this place, Senator Canavan, would say that gas reservation does not work, but something has to be done to give security of supply and security in terms of prices and downward pressure on prices for manufacturers in this country and in my home state, where energy prices are sky-high and actually impeding investment in manufacturing and the jobs that are created in the manufacturing sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already seen since the GFC manufacturing in this country shrink from 12 per cent to just over six per cent of GDP and 200,000 jobs have been lost. We now have a situation in this country where as a percentage of our GDP manufacturing hovering just above six per cent is just bumping above Botswana and Rwanda, two countries in Africa that have never had a manufacturing base like we have had. We have seen a massive shrinking of it, and that has profound implications for our economy. It is a shadow of what Germany's GDP base of manufacturing is: 22 per cent, which is a jobs and industrial powerhouse for Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned about ensuring that we get the balance right and that communities are heard in terms of CSG explorations. In my home state, on the Limestone Coast it is not CSG but it does involve drilling, and there are genuine concerns about fracking and the impact it can have on prime agricultural land. But there are gas suppliers in this country that do not pose the same environmental and community concerns, and we need to be able to unleash those. That is why I will be moving a second reading amendment in respect of retention leases. I do so to flag the issue. I do not propose to divide on that, but I would be grateful if the minister could indicate views on that. I will in good faith sit down, negotiate and discuss this issue further with Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg in respect of these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that relates to having competitive tension in the retention lease approval process. Currently, a company can retain a lease if recovery of petroleum or gas from the licence area is not yet commercially viable but is likely to become viable within 15 years. Every five years a company has to either commercialise the licence area or show that the licence area is still not commercially viable. On the face of it, the current rules are saying 'Use it or lose it,' but if you drill down into this—pun intended—it does not actually do that. It is a pretty weak set of proposals under the current legislative framework. It does not actually require that competitive tension. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my understanding that, under the current regime, there is theoretical competitive tension, in that another company can put forward a development proposal, but in practice there are major impediments to do so. That is because a company cannot get hold of the seismic surveys, the seismic work, that another company may have done, which could have cost many millions of dollars. I think we need to find a way around that. A new company may come in and say: 'We want to develop this gas resource. We will look at the seismic surveys.' They do it commercial-in-confidence. If they end up taking over that lease, they need to contribute fairly to the cost of the seismic surveys done by the previous company. That is a way around the impasse that currently exists. This is something that needs to be dealt with. Currently, a company has to make a binding commercial proposal, but they cannot do so because they cannot access the key information in terms of the seismic surveys and the like. This is the sort of thing that we need to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not have the figures in front of me, but if I happen to get a text from my office in the next 30 seconds, it might tell me how much gas is in the Bass Strait. In the Bass Strait, there are leases that a number of major oil companies have had for a number of years. My understanding is that the reserves are very significant. If we could tap those resources, it would, at least for the next few years, make a very big difference to gas prices in this country and to energy security in this country. It would also relieve, to a significant extent, the issue of communities having legitimate concerns about CSG and the impact on prime agricultural land. We do not have the same environmental and community concerns in the Bass Strait, given the history of the Bass Strait and given that it is gas—not petroleum—drilling we are talking about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is something that ought to be considered. That is why I will move the second reading amendment standing in my name, which will be dealt with at the conclusion of the second reading debate of this bill. Even if my amendment is not supported, this issue will not go away. There are too many manufacturers and too many jobs at stake to ignore the gas that is in the Bass Strait. Some local Australian companies would like to get access to that gas and have a go at developing it, but they cannot because the current rules act as a massive barrier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very grateful to my office. Unusually, they are listening to what I am saying! They tell me that there is seven trillion cubic feet of gas in the Bass Strait. That is a big figure. It is a big figure like the Australia Post CEO's salary! Seven trillion cubic feet is a significant amount of gas that would make a real dent in the issues of energy security, which I know Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg are concerned about. This is a discussion I have had in good faith. I am flagging this amendment, not so much to make a political point but to say that this is an issue that cannot be ignored. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Senator Hanson-Young's amendment in respect of drilling in the Great Australian Bight, I and my colleagues will support that amendment. This parliament cannot bind future parliaments, but right now, based on the evidence that I heard at the Senate inquiry that I instigated in the previous parliament, I strongly support what Senator Hanson-Young has proceeded with. The precautionary principle should weigh heavily on our minds. It seems that there are not sufficient safeguards in the current framework. NOPSEMA has made the right call initially, but my concern is that drilling in that area, given the potential risks, is something that we should not countenance. I think an alternative such as accessing that seven trillion cubic feet of gas in the Bass Strait will make a significant impact on this country's energy security. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had another text from my office, and the caveat is that the figure of seven trillion is a total of the proven, probable and possible. Even allowing for various risk factors in regard to that, there is a hell of a lot of gas in the Bass Strait that could be unleashed. It seems to me that, because of commercial considerations, new entrants cannot have access to that gas under the current rules that are stacked against them. We should have a 'use it or lose it' approach, as they have in other countries. We need to use it, given the crisis that Australian manufacturing has in respect of jobs and in respect of energy prices. That is something that I will prosecute in good faith with Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg because that could be a short- to medium-term solution for the energy problems we are facing in this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">):</span>  I thank all contributors to this debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill. It is an important, albeit rather technical, change to our offshore regulatory framework. The bill contains amendments which will ensure the ongoing validity of apportionment agreements that are made under section 54 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act. These amendments will deal with areas where there may be multiple petroleum pools rather than a single pool.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The apportionment agreements allow for the Commonwealth and state governments, or territory governments, to come to an agreement where a petroleum pool might straddle two jurisdictional areas and allow us to provide certainty, particularly to those investors that may be seeking to develop that resource, so they can understand how we will split the benefits of the resource between investors and the Commonwealth or state and territory governments. These amendments will allow for governments to make these agreements where there may be uncertainty about whether a particular resource is simply a single petroleum pool or may in the future, after further geological information becomes available, in fact be a multiple pool. The bill underscores the government's ongoing commitment to investment in our offshore petroleum sector. It is critical that the legislation is appropriate to encourage that investment, and it is critical that we provide certainty to investors to allow those investments to occur.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note that while the Senate committees were looking at this bill there were some questions about the potentially retrospective application of the bill. We have made an addendum to the explanatory memorandum, and returned information to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, to indicate that there will be no detriment because these agreements are entered into on a voluntary basis and, indeed, the only agreement under section 54 at the moment is that relating to the Torosa field, which is why we are moving these amendments in this bill. At this stage, I would like to table the addendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016. The addendum responds to those concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The bill also, in a different schedule, amends the act to ensure that there is a clear regulation making power to support regulations that provide for the refund and remittal of environmental plan levies and safety case levies in certain circumstances. I commend this bill to the chamber.</span>

I put that down to the Elvis Costello concert I went to in 1977, where I lost a bit of my hearing and I have never got it back. I am very grateful for the support of the opposition in relation to this, because it is a commonsense second reading amendment. I would be grateful if the government would indicate what its views are on this, because there is particularly in Bass Strait seven trillion cubic feet, potentially, of gas that could really do something to alleviate our energy crisis in this country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I am happy to clarify the government's position on this. I apologise for not getting the opportunity before the second reading amendment was moved. It is a very important issue that Senator Xenophon has raised, and the government recognises that. We of course did not support your second reading amendment, Senator Xenophon. We do already have a review of our offshore petroleum resource management process in place, which includes and encompasses an examination of the retention lease framework. Consultation on that review was completed late last year, around November. I am working with my department to respond to that sometime this year, and I am more than happy to work with Senator Xenophon on that issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very important issue. There is a balance that we need to strike in that framework, a balance that needs to attract investment and give those investors, those companies, security that they will be able to make a return on what are very high costs and very risky investments in exploring frontier areas in sometimes very deep waters. They do need to be given a fair opportunity to make a return on those investments. Otherwise, no-one would turn up to make them. We are not going to have the resource unless someone originally explores for it. While our framework is under review, we have to strike an appropriate balance between the competitive tension that Senator Xenophon and also making it attractive for people to invest here and be able to make a return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will respond to a couple of other points that Senator Xenophon raised in his contribution—the specific ones regarding Bass Strait, and also the Great Australian Bight. If I can say respectfully, Senator Xenophon, it is a little disappointing to me that you are trying to have your cake and eat it too in this debate. Yes, there is a substantial resource in Bass Strait; there is no doubt about that. There is a lot of gas left in Bass Strait. What there is not a lot of left, or there is not as much of what was there before, is oil, or condensate. We must not forget that one of the prime reasons that the Gippsland basin was developed was because of that condensate, that oil resource. That was the economics behind the development of the resource. The gas in some senses was a by-product. That has often been the history of gas developments around the world—that gas is often the secondary product that is created from an oil play. That is why gas can often be quite cheap. Manufacturing industries are often located near oil developments where gas is a by-product and a cheap by-product. That is certainly what happened in Victoria historically, and the Victorian manufacturing industry has benefitted from that resource.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality right now is that there is not as much oil in the Bass Strait as there once was. So the average costs of developing that resource are now high because there is less of that product to sell and there are fewer products to sell from the development of those resources. The average cost of developing that gas is higher. It is not necessarily the panacea that Senator Xenophon makes out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are looking at our offshore management processes—and I am very open to suggestions to improve competition to develop that resource—it perhaps will not be as easy as Senator Xenophon makes out. The resource is there but, obviously, it comes down to at what cost we can develop that resource and whether that cost can be paid by the gas customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the Great Australian Bight, which will no doubt come up further in this debate. On Senator Xenophon's point, on one hand you would like to develop the Bass Strait and get that gas out of there but on the other hand you are saying that you want to have a complete ban before even our environmental regulators can look into whether we can develop that resource in an environmentally sustainable way and also protect the manufacturing interests that Senator Xenophon spoke of. I do not doubt your sincerity, Senator Xenophon, in wanting to see a strong manufacturing industry in this country but it does need energy to survive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt there is excitement around the potential resource that exists in the Great Australian Bight. It is a very prospective resource—perhaps one of the best and most prospective in the world. I spoke to Chevron in the United States a few weeks ago and this is one of their top priorities around the world in terms of prospectivity. Again, Senator Xenophon, the reason people are excited about the resource is not the gas; it is the oil that is potentially there. We do not know the resource yet. It needs to be explored. But it will probably be the oil that attracts investment. There will be gas too, no doubt, if there is oil and that gas will then be able to be provided to those manufacturing interests you want to represent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt there are environmental issues. We must seek to protect the Great Australian Bight. That is very important. That is why we have an independent regulator. That is their job. That is why the experts should be left to look at this and assess this. If we were to support the approach from the Australian Greens, which Senator Xenophon says he supports, it would completely cut out the independent regulator from this process and completely stop the potential for jobs and opportunities for the South Australian economy in particular. So the government do not support that approach. We would like to see our resources developed for the benefit of our country, including the manufacturing industries of our nation. That needs to be done in an environmentally sustainable way and in a sensible way that takes expert advice from the people who know what they are talking about. We will balance the issues and interests that we need to to make sure we have both a strong economy and a protected environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  Thank you, Minister, for your response. I reject absolutely and vehemently that I am trying to have my cake and eat it too in relation to that. There is a world of difference between the reserves. With the Great Australian Bight prospective oil reserves there is the depth of the drilling that will have to take place, what the seas are like there—how rough they can be—and some of the environmental studies. I know that NOPSEMA has leaked—I know that the regulator has looked at this—the potential environmental impact and the economic effect of that impact on aquiculture and on tourism. The environmental clean-up costs would be quite significant. There is a world of difference between those reserves and the Bass Strait reserves, which are gas. The drilling issues are very different and the depths are quite different. There is a world of difference between those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I was making with the second reading amendment was that a company can say, 'It is not commercially viable for us to develop the Bass Strait reserve,' and they do so because it may not fit in with their global plans, but there could be some other companies, including local Australian companies that I and my office have spoken to, that say, 'We actually want to give this a go but we need access to the seismic surveys.' There is a problem with the current system, and I know that the minister will work on this in good faith and assiduously. If there were an alternative plan and they could have access to the seismic surveys—and there were a mechanism, a formula, for them to pay for those seismic surveys—and they ended up making a successful bid then that would be a game changer in relation to having those other companies having access to those reserves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to take it any further than that but there is a distinction between the two reserves and there are risks to the environment. There are the proven and/or probable gas reserves in the Bass Strait and there are risks involved with drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight. I hope we can access that gas in the Bass Strait sooner rather than later because of the impact that will have on industry security, our nation's economy and the manufacturing sector.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  First of all I would like to clear something up for <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. I have just come from the PM's office and I was in a bit of a rush. I should have been voting on this side of the floor. The reason being is I do not agree with this bill, and I am going to tell you why. When you read the two legislative purposes put forward by the government, which are to clarify the apportionment definitions of petroleum deposits and to allow the environmental management authority to refund fees paid to it by big oil and gas companies, on paper it seems simple. However, this legislation will affect hundreds of billions of dollars of capital investment in Australia's LNG export industry and many hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for Australian taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If our LNG industry was healthy, if the Australian taxpayer was getting a fair share of the royalties through the PRRT and if the east coast of Australia, including Tasmania, was not looking at shortages or significant increases in the cost of gas for industries and households then I would be inclined to support the government's legislation. However, there are a number of alarming signs that this government has failed to properly manage our natural resources, especially LNG and petroleum products. The government has put out mixed and contradictory messages on LNG. There are clear signs that our national energy supplies are at risk and, therefore, I do not trust this government's legislation. Until I receive more information from the government about the effects of this legislation and they take steps to ensure our gas, petroleum and other energy sources remain relatively cheap in comparison to our overseas competitors and gas supplies are secured for future generations in Tasmania, I will not support this legislation. </span>

He and his Liberal mates have to explain why they have allowed such generous LNG deals to be signed with big multinationals. There is no use in being the world's largest exporter when we have become the world's largest soft touch on LNG, and our grandchildren are being denied hundreds of billions in royalty and tax payments, which are instead lining the pockets of overseas corporate executives and their shareholders.</span>

Did those big multinational companies that were given sweetheart deals, most likely by both major political parties in this place, give big political donations to the Labor, Liberal and National parties? The LNG deals this country has entered into in the last two decades need close scrutiny, with the questions I have asked in mind. Perhaps it is time for a Senate committee inquiry, because I want to know why our kids are missing out on these profits, especially when you have the incredible situation of a Liberal energy minister boasting in his second reading speech:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are going to be serious about securing our gas security, we must put in place a domestic gas reserve policy of at least 20 per cent and possibly more. That would be another great question a Senate committee could look at when examining the state of our LNG industry—does Australia need a gas reserve policy and at what level should it be set at? We should look at the lessons from America, which made a gas reserve policy of 100 per cent after the GFC. It had the impact of driving down the cost of energy by a factor of three in America, which then threw a lifeline to the manufacturing industry. That, along with robotics and innovation, has led the resurgence in America's economy and caused a growth in its jobs and national wealth. But it all started with an American gas reserve policy of 100 per cent, which forced down energy prices following the GFC and gave conventional energy security for America.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the Prime Minister and his Liberal colleagues understand why we need energy security and why we need the cheapest possible energy prices in the OECD at the very least and in the world at best. Last week I put out a public statement in which I welcomed parts of Prime Minister Turnbull's National Press Club speech, especially his prediction that electricity prices and energy security will be the defining political issues in the year ahead. That was two years and five months after I made my first Senate speech, which indicated that energy security and prices should influence all Australian political decision-making. On Wednesday, 3 September 2014, I told the Senate, in my first speech, with regard energy power:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this place as a senator I will do my best to vote in and protect Tasmania's and Australia's best interests. In order to help determine what is in my state's and nation's best interests, I will ask this simple question: how will this legislation or proposal affect our food security, water security, energy security, national security and job security?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In a deregulated world and free-trade economic environment, if we are to create national wealth, generate more high-tech jobs and protect Australian workers' wages then the only solution is for our governments to deliver the cheapest electricity and power in the world to our pensioners, families, industry and entrepreneurs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am glad that Prime Minister Turnbull has, on energy at least, finally seen the light and begun to understand the strong link between Australian standards of living, business innovation, economic prosperity, job growth and energy cost security. Eventually, if he continues on this course, the PM will realise that our stupid RET system has artificially increased Australia's energy costs by $3 billion a year and wrecked our nation's energy security while destroying business innovation, economic prosperity, job growth and living standards, with no benefit to the environment. No-one in their right mind could ever say that forcing our businesses, families and pensioners to artificially pay more for their power in comparison with our international competitors will ever stop global climate change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, this bill makes amendments to the regulation of offshore petroleum. Some of the gas and oil is under the control of the states and some is under the control of the federal government. It is very easy to get confused who owns what, and the Parliamentary Library has cleared that confusion up through a report they gave me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I note that item 3 proposes to insert subsection 688C(1)(a) to provide a clear power for the government to make regulations to provide for remittals or refunds to big business of part of the environmental plan levy. Given that the government has already given sweetheart deals to the larger energy companies that will benefit generously from extracting oil and gas from Australia's many well-endowed gas and oil basins, I have grave reservations in supporting legislation which makes it easier for the government to give more money back to the multinationals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I will not be agreeing to the government's legislation, which makes it easier for the government to give even more money back to the multinationals while they justify cuts to aged pensioners and family benefits and payments as so-called budget repair. It is rubbish. Those pensioners and families are also owners. We are all owners of Australia's natural resources, which this government has failed to manage wisely. As a result, it is aged pensioners and working families who are supposed to miss out on entitlements—well, not on my watch. I oppose this legislation for the reasons I have outlined, and I look forward to speaking with the government. Do you have a response?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I thank Senator Lambie for her contribution. There is a lot in what Senator Lambie said that I agree with completely. She spoke about the need for our nation to secure its energy resources, to provide cheaper energy to households and pensioners and also to industry and businesses so they can be competitive and provide jobs. In terms of our objectives of what we want, we and Senator Lambie are very much of one mind. But I would like to talk about a few points Senator Lambie has raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You mentioned how this legislation helps solve these problems, and that is the core issue; you have hit the nail on the head on that: how will this legislation help us solve these energy issues? Well, it is not a panacea, and I am not here and the government is not here to say that this is the solution for all issues. It is a relatively technical and small change to our framework that will give certainty to investors coming here to develop these resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where I absolutely agree is that we need to encourage more gas supply in our nation; we need to develop gas so that those manufacturers, the energy providers, can continue to provide energy to our country in a cheap and affordable way, and we have traditionally been given those God given resources that Senator Lambie mentioned. So, when investors come here and there is a resource and there is uncertainty about whether it comes under state laws or state jurisdiction or Commonwealth jurisdiction, unless we can make clear to them where the dividing lines are and how we will coordinate between state and Commonwealth governments, clearly those investors will be warded away or at least be less likely to come here to our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill simply provides clarity for those investors and helps ensure that Commonwealth and state governments can come to agreements to make that happen. So, as I mentioned earlier, while there are elements of this bill that will be retrospective, it relates only to one agreement so far under section 54, which relates to the Tarosa fields in the Browse Basin, where there is this uncertainty between Commonwealth and state governments. And that is retrospectivity. It will not cause detriment, because, indeed, that agreement was made with the expectation that we would be making these changes to legislation to clarify these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other specific point Senator Lambie made, about refunds and remittals, this is a practice that the government has already done, where either environmental plans or safety cases do not proceed or there is some withdrawal such that we refund or remit the levies in those cases. We are making sure that those powers do exist, and we are also ensuring, in the case of environmental levies, where those refunds have been paid in the past, that they are valid. In the explanatory memorandum we explained that the total amount of those refunds adds up to $500,000 over the time—it was a few years back, but I could get you the date, Senator Lambie, if you need it. But it is not an enormous amount of money in the context of the PRRT that we do raise, as you say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me just briefly to the other points, which are beyond the scope of this bill. But on the issues you raised about the PRRT, I hear what you are saying, and the government hears these issues and concerns. That is why, just before Christmas, we announced a review into the PRRT framework. You are right: it is our resource, and we need to maximise it and ensure that we get the maximum benefit to all Australians from that resource. At the same time, we need to attract people to come here and invest. You mentioned some other countries, like Malaysia and Qatar. In many of those other nations, governments themselves develop their resources. They have government-owned companies which develop their resources. That is why they have different arrangements and different returns. They take on the risks of that development and they potentially get the returns as well. We do not do that here; we seek for the private sector to develop those resources, and over the past few years that has certainly accorded us well, treated us well, because many of these investments have experienced cost blowouts and they will not make the returns perhaps that the original investors would have thought. We will still have the development and have the jobs, but if we had been making those investments it would have been Australian taxpayers on the hook for those losses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those losses, and the oil price falls, have certainly impacted the prospects for the government to receive its petroleum resource rent tax. It is a profits based tax, so it is calculated waiting for profit to accumulate. That is why it takes some years for the capital of a big project like Gorgon to be paid back, and then the government will take its share of the profits. That is the system we have had in this country going back to the 1980s, and it was recently extended by the former Gillard Labor government to onshore gas resources as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding that, we are genuinely, in good faith, conducting a review to ensure that we do have the greatest return to Australians from that resource. I hope and am willing to work with you, Senator Lambie, through that review on the legitimate issues you have raised. I understand your concerns, but I would just implore you that the specific provisions we are changing in the act here, in this bill, will help encourage, in a small way, investment in our energy sector. And they are important, and that is why they should be supported.</span>

One is that we need to make sure we attract investment in our energy resource. But where we do agree, Senator Lambie, is that we need more gas. We need to develop more gas.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You mentioned the United States. Well, the United States does not have a gas reservation policy. What it does have is a large domestic market which has traditionally soaked up all the gas that has been developed in the United States. It is in fact, right now, building LNG terminals on its south coast, and very soon it will be a major exporter of LNG into possibly our region, the Asia-Pacific region, from its resources. You are right that they have been able to tap and extract relatively low-cost resources. They have not faced the same moratoriums or bans we have in this country and various state governments have allowed the development, and that has allowed them to get costs down, to get to a scale that has been very competitive. I am not sure whether you were in the chamber earlier when Senator Xenophon was contributing, but it is also the case that a lot of their shale gas or shale resources also produce a fair amount of tight oil and a wet resource as well, which helps them lower their costs and become more competitive. The coal seam gas we have developed in this country so far does not have those oil resources partnered with it, so, generally speaking, it is of a higher average cost.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeking the same objective, Senator Lambie, but a gas reservation policy, I think, requires very careful consideration. The Western Australian government has had such a policy for some time; it does not seem to have greatly increased the amount of domestic gas available in that state. I think we can look at other ways and better ways, particularly the unnecessary and illogical moratorium on even conventional gas that is coming into the Victorian parliament. That is what we should focus on; that is most prospective; and that is where we can get a solution to this issue.</span>

We have been very successful in this country in developing our gas resources, where state and/or Commonwealth governments—if they are in offshore waters—have allowed that resource to be developed. In Queensland, where I am from, we have attracted record amounts of investment in the LNG industry and in the other part of the country where the chair is from there has been even greater investment in offshore resources. </span>

That will turn away investment and we will not have the resource developed and we will not have the gas for our manufacturing sector that you and I both want. That is what we should be focused on. We need to be focused on unlocking the supply, not seeking to send it in a certain direction. We need to be unlocking the incentives for people to invest in that supply, not putting on state-wide bans, which even ban conventional gas developments—conventional gas techniques which have been around for decades, if not centuries. That is illogical and is harming our manufacturing interests in this country. That is something we do not support; we think it is counterproductive. I do not think the reservation policy that Senator Lambie has put forward is a solution to those issues.</span>

We are looking at that tax at the moment and doing a review; and so it would be inappropriate for me to forecast or to suggest right now what changes we would make. Suffice to say, any move to a volume-based tax would not necessarily achieve what we want. Of course, a volume-based tax would simply be on the production and have no relation to the profit that is received on a particular development. It could potentially harm particularly marginal developments—but if those developments that might not make a lot of profit—very unfairly and choke off the very investment that we want to achieve. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is generally felt that a tax based on profits is more efficient. That is why the Commonwealth government moved to this regime in the 1980s and that is why the former Gillard Labor government extended that to onshore areas a few years ago. That regime means that we take our share once there are profits there and that, of course, helps encourage private investors to come here knowing that they can make a profit and a return, which they legitimately should be allowed to do, and then just pay a share back to the Commonwealth government. There are whole lot of details about how that tax system and regime work, notwithstanding the general idea that a profits-based tax is the best way forward. That is what this review is looking at. I am happy to engage the senator with this review and on those particular details.</span>

It was announced just before Christmas—I believe in the last sitting week we were here. They have issued a discussion paper—is that the term?—or certainly an initial scoping paper and they are seeking submissions right now. As I said to Senator Lambie, I am happy to engage with her about that. While I do not wish to predict the outcomes from that, there has been a regime in place in this country based on profits-based tax for some time. We can disagree, Senator Lambie, about the success or lack of success, but we have attracted some of the world's biggest capital investment projects in this nation under that regime. The Gorgon development is one of the world's biggest capital projects which is going on right now. The Inpex project in Darwin likewise is one of the biggest in the world. These generate enormous amounts of investment for our country and they have created tens of thousands of jobs for people across Australia—particularly for areas in Northern Australia, it has been game changing. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we need to do better to get gas into southern markets, those issues are largely related to the state governments not allowing the development of their resource. Whereas in Northern Australia, the Western Australian government, the Queensland government and the Northern Territory government have welcomed the gas industry with open arms. They have said, 'Let's come here and invest here.' Guess what? By being open, by being accommodating and by facilitating investment, you get investment. That is what has happened. If we had that attitude in southern Australia, I think we might have different outcomes. It has been a success attracting those major investments. They are hugely important to Senator Back's area, to my own state and to Senator Scullion's territory as well. That is a major success for our country that we should be very proud of.</span>

Firstly, I want to point out that one of the biggest concerns that the Australian Greens have with this bill and the reason we are moving the amendments that were circulated in the committee stage is that we fundamentally believe that the Liberal Party, the coalition, and the Labor Party have been bought by these big oil and gas companies. We know they have been bought because these companies keep handing over thousands and thousands of dollars in election donations. One of the donations that was revealed last week was made by Chevron—a big multinational foreign company that wants to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight. Chevron gave $8,800 to the South Australian Labor Party a week before the Senate committee looking into mining and drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight met. One week before that hearing, the Labor Party received thousands of dollars worth of donations from Chevron. Then only the day after that inquiry, guess who received the next lot of donations? The Liberal Party. Chevron gave another $8,800 to the South Australian Liberal Party. </span>

                    </a>  Join the dots. This is dirty money playing a role in dirty politics. You have a bill before this chamber today that is all about setting up the regulatory framework that the big oil and gas mining companies desperately want. It is about setting up the regulatory system that they want, retrospectively. They have bought favour with both of the major parties, and it is at the cost of the Australian community. We now have lobbyists running around this place, knocking on the doors of ministers and shadow ministers, saying, 'Oh please, let us start drilling for oil in what is meant to be a marine protected area, a Commonwealth marine protected area, in the Great Australian Bight.' The public is rightly worried that the money being donated by these massive big oil and gas companies is having influence over the policy decisions of both the major parties. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The example of Chevron connected directly to the time frames of Senate investigation and inquiry and, I must say, questions from senators in this place to Chevron, who were basically asking Chevron to sit in a Senate hearing and tell the world how wonderful they are. If that is not cash for comment, what is it? Chevron's cash for comment is what we saw in the Senate hearing: $8,800 and then another $8,800 to the state parties; $15,000 to the federal Labor Party; and $11,000 to the federal Nationals. This big multinational company is buying favour with Australian political parties to get the policies they want. The Australian public are sick of it. Dirty money leads to dirty politics. Our democracy is not for sale, people! Our democracy means that is a place where policies are debated on merit, debates are had with integrity, and members of parliament stand for what they say, not because someone has paid them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australians in particular are very concerned about what is potentially listed for the Great Australian Bight. We know that the risks are huge. They have not been mitigated. There is not even a proper response plan from these big companies, who just want to come in and drill for oil in the middle of a whale sanctuary: big profits for them; big risk for South Australians. It is putting our tourism industry at risk and our fishing industry at risk and providing no jobs for South Australians. The jobs are going to be imported from overseas. </span>

                    </a>  The companies have said, black and white, that they cannot guarantee any real job creation in South Australia as a result of this proposal. But I tell you what: the fishing industry and the tourism industry are scared. What if there is an oil spill? What happens to our clean, green tourism reputation in South Australia if a spill occurs? Don't say, 'Oh, it can't possibly happen.' We saw what happened in the Gulf of Mexico. It will not just be a spill in the Great Australian Bight, which is one of the roughest parts of the sea in the world. The modelling shows it will spread further than just the South Australian coast. It will hit Victoria. It will hit Tasmania. It could even possibly get up to the New South Wales east coast. This is the evidence that has been presented, yet here in this place today rather than us having a discussion about how we keep these companies more accountable, we are rolling over. We have the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, the government here, rolling over and saying: 'Oh, you want changes to the regulatory framework. Oh, you need it done retrospectively? Oh, yes, that's right, you did donate to our election campaign—how many years in a row?' That is what is going on here. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Giant multinational oil companies should never been given permits to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight, especially considering the lack of foresight, transparency and planning that has been presented. All of this is being done behind closed doors. Only last week we found out that big amounts of cash were being handed to both the government, the coalition, and the Labor Party. No wonder Chevron think they are on a winner here. Chevron's cash for comment. That is what we have seen in the last few months, folks, and this bill is no exception. On that note, Chair, I refer to the official amendments on sheet 7956 and seek leave to move those amendments.</span>

                    </a>  We are, as you all know in this place, more than happy to have a debate on the issue of political donations, and our policy is really clear. But Senator Hanson-Young comes in here in a debate about a bill around offshore petroleum and strongly puts her case in terms of the environmental issues. She has every right to make those arguments, and I have no doubt we will listen to them just as we will in the Senate inquiry—those things will be before the inquiry. But to colour this debate by making statements about publicly declared donations to the parties and then to draw that inference just to get a quick point in this debate does not value the issues about which we are talking.</span>

We have heard a lot about who has received large donations from which companies and from which individuals. There is a time to have that debate. But again, rather than looking at the key issues of this particular debate, which is what we are looking at, we have had it taken aside just for a cheap line, and I think it has been heard by a number of people. Linking one company to cash for comment does not progress the debate. So we will put on record that we are not supporting the amendments. We are more than happy for the debate to continue. We want to ensure that there is effective processing of environmental concerns when looking at our energy future in this nation. But yelling abuse across this chamber will not achieve that and will just ensure that, again, the real issues are not considered.</span>

                    </a>  She is suggesting not only that some donations affect individual senators, but she is going on to make the allegation that we will develop a resource, the Great Australian Bight, because of some donation to a political party, when she well knows that those decisions on developing the Great Australian Bight are made by an independent regulator, by independent public servants with expertise in these areas. So she is also slurring those public servants, who are reputable individuals who do their job, day in, day out, and do not deserve the slurs from individual senators that Senator Hanson-Young is subjecting them to. Surely it is enough, Senator Hanson-Young, as Senator Moore said eloquently, for all of us to debate these issues on the substance and the merits, which we can do with those officials. We can debate with those officials and disagree with them, but I think it is contemptible to impugn motives to public servants who are just doing their job and cannot be in here to defend themselves on those allegations in that way. So I utterly reject those suggestions from Senator Hanson-Young.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Moore said, we could side track here and go into a whole debate about how many donations the Greens get from different individuals and different organisations and do the same thing, but that would be a complete distraction, because the issues before us here are quite simple, quite technical and do not relate to the Great Australian Bight, which Senator Hanson-Young's amendment does. That brings me to your amendment, Senator Hanson-Young, and we reject that for similar reasons. We reject that because we have an independent regulator here that is established to look at these things. They should be allowed to do their job. I love how the Greens, when a certain umpire calls a decision in their favour, use the authority of that particular organisation to buttress their claims and say, 'Such-and-such has said this, so therefore you can't do that.' But when an independent umpire says something different to what the Greens expect or want, they will disagree with it. You cannot have it both ways. We have a very robust environmental regulatory framework in this country. It will seriously look at all of the matters that Senator Hanson-Young has put forward, and it was doing that. As Senator Hanson-Young knows, BP are not progressing with their environmental plan. But the regulator will, for future companies involved in the Great Australian Bight, look at these things seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in response to Senator Xenophon, the Australian government would very much like to develop the resources in the Great Australian Bight. They have potential to be game-changing for our nation to secure our nation's energy needs. It is what we need. We do not produce a lot of oil in this country—as you know, Senator Hanson-Young—and it is an issue for us to respond to. The Great Australian Bight has the prospect—just the prospect—that it could help solve those issues. So those developments are very exciting for our country and should be exciting for South Australian senators because they are a major resource for your state and could be a game changer for it—it certainly needs something to develop its economy. But that is in the future. We need to step through those environmental plans properly, which we will do. We have a very robust framework in this country with a very good record on both safety and environmental matters. We stand behind that framework, and we certainly defend the integrity of those public servants that operate it for us.</span>

                    </a>  and this would be described, as the senator has just done, as 'dirty money'. I think it has to be stated unequivocally that Labor senators' integrity should not be challenged in that way, and such a suggestion should be repudiated in the most forceful terms. I am particularly impressed by the Greens' gall in these matters; they have more front than Myer when it comes to the question of donations. Up until recently the largest single individual donation was actually received by the Greens. I know Malcolm Turnbull has changed the rules in that regard with his $1.75 million donation. But on several occasions now Mr Graeme Wood has been the largest single donor in this nation's history—to the Greens.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the question of Chevron, let me make it very clear, because the Greens have been trying to campaign on this question for some time—in regard to the CSIRO; in regard to the development of Bass Strait. I support the development of our resources, particularly given how significant the development of those resources is to the future prosperity of this nation and to millions of blue-collar workers across this country. The CSIRO is engaged in research, properly, ethically, and in accordance with the most strict guidelines to ensure that information is publicly available and is not compromised because of that investment by Chevron. It is an appropriate use of public resources to establish where our resources actually are and what the questions are in regard to the strictest environmental standards necessary to exploit them. The suggestion that somehow or other and $8,000 donation changes the dynamic in that regard is preposterous, and I suggest to you that to challenge the integrity of the Labor senators on that basis is totally out of order.</span>

On the one hand we have a minister who says we are going to be one of the biggest exporters in a world of LNG and then on the other hand we have a minister who says we are having a domestic crisis because of a domestic shortage. On top of that, both of you have been doing dud deals between yourselves for years—dud deals in taking political donations. And you do not think the Australian people are wondering why they should vote for you? If you were half-serious about political donations you would be putting them up live. If you get them one day and that cheque is cleared then get them up there and show the people. You do not wait 18 months or 12 months. If you were half serious about showing that you are all clear in this matter, then get them up there live and let the Australian people decide whether or not you are being paid by cheque book or whether you are actually doing it for them and their future.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  Labor supports this Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016 because it provides certainty for industry that safe harbour provisions under Australian Consumer Law are aligned with new country of origin labelling requirements. This will help protect enterprises, particularly Australian food manufacturers, make claims under the new mandatory labelling requirements that came into effect on 1 July 2016. This issue called for a bipartisanship approach in taking steps to resolve a longstanding problem, and that is what has happened. That said, sometimes on the way to this resolution we in the opposition have been bemused by the antics of some members of the government, especially the Deputy Prime Minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The basic problem these reforms address was set out clearly in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry, tabled in October 2014. The committee recommended that labelling standards should be changed to make it easier for consumers to identify the sources of food products and the places where they are processed—the perfectly reasonable proposition that people know where their food has come from. The wording on many labels, 'Made in Australia using local and imported ingredients', clearly did not do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As senators will remember, however, what actually spurred the government into action was a food contamination scare in February 2015, after the report had been received. The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services announced that two brands of frozen berries sold in supermarkets had been linked to multiple cases of hepatitis A. The company that produced both brands obtained its berries from Chile and China, and processed them in China's Shandong province. Pictures emerged of excrement-clogged factories in Shandong, and in the subsequent media frenzy and consumer panic the careful wording of the Victorian announcement was usually ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Victorian department said was that ingesting frozen berries was the only common link between the hepatitis cases. It did not claim that ingesting contaminated berries had caused all the cases. This fine distinction vanished completely when the then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, the agriculture minister, Mr Joyce, and the then industry minister, Mr Macfarlane, called a media conference. They announced that a working party of ministers would consider the House of Representatives' report on food labelling. Mr Joyce blithely ignored the fact that the report had been presented to the government before the contamination scare, without being acted upon. He said, 'It's great to be part of a government that's actually going to do something.' On Channel 9's <span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> program he spoke more directly to the fears that the contaminated berries scare had aroused in consumers. He said, 'Buy Australian and save yourself a pain in the guts.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor agrees that the best way of ensuring that packaged food is of acceptable quality is to buy Australian. I do it for a lot of other reasons as well—that is why I have been wearing this 'Made in Australia' badge for many, many years. We in the Labor Party have supported the adoption of the new system of food labels. It must be acknowledged that there are still other issues to be resolved, some of which have been raised in the original House of Representatives report. The gold kangaroo in a green triangle, above a filled-in or partly filled-in gold bar code, can tell consumers how much, if any, of the product has been grown and processed in Australia. This kind of labelling does not provide information about anywhere else the product might have come from. If the new system had applied at the time of the frozen berries scare, consumers would have been none the wiser about the origin of the berries that became a matter of contention. Nonetheless, the system is better than what it replaced, because when the Government was not diverted by trying to score points on this issue, as it did during the berries scare and again in the election campaign, it has actually done the right thing. It consulted stakeholders in the food industry and the state and territory governments. That is what we urged the governments to do when we offered support for the reform of food labelling in February last year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill now before the Senate, like the new labelling requirements that came into force in July, is a result of those consultations. The new labelling requirements have been endorsed by state ministers for consumer affairs, the Food and Grocery Council, AUSVEG, the National Farmers' Federation and the consumer advocacy group Choice. These bodies have also supported the present bill, which alters the 'safe harbour' provisions of the Australian consumer law for businesses making country-of-origin claims. Safe harbour provisions are intended to give businesses certainty about the claims they can make without infringing consumer law. If a business makes a country-of-origin claim for its product, and that claim is alleged to be false or deceptive, the business has an automatic defence if it can show that the product meets the conditions laid down in the safe-harbour provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the existing law, for a business to rely on this protection either the goods have to be substantially transformed in the place that is claimed as the country of origin or at least 50 per cent of the total costs of production must have occurred in that country. This bill strengthens the safe-harbour protections for food products by declaring the meaning of 'substantial transformation.' It removes the 50 per cent cost of production test, which is redundant now that food labels show the proportion of Australian ingredients. These are sensible changes that complement the new labelling system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor continues to support this reform process, but we remind the government that the process of reform does not end with this bill. The government could go further and give full consideration to the bipartisan House of Representatives report that was originally tabled in 2014. We also urge the government to end its neglect of biosecurity and of Australia's manufacturing sector, of which food processing is such an important part, especially in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Buying Australian will always be the best way for consumers to have confidence in the quality of food products. The maintenance of a vigorous manufacturing sector is the best way of ensuring that Australians will have high-skill, high-wage jobs and that the economy becomes less reliant on the vagaries of commodity exports.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. The Greens have been leading the way on country-of-origin labelling law for years. We want to see labelling laws that work for Australians—that work for Australian farmers, manufacturers and consumers. Since 1998 we have been working with the industry to develop our proposal to make country-of-origin labelling mandatory for all packaged and unpackaged food sold in Australia. The Greens' proposal since that time would simplify country-of-origin labels to three basic claims: something has to be either made in Australia, grown in Australia or manufactured in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to encourage companies to highlight any significant local ingredients. This bill does not do that, but it does go some way to simplifying the system that we currently have. That is important, because we know that Australians want to do the right thing when they are buying their food. When they are standing there in the supermarket aisle and trying to choose between this tin of tomatoes and that one, they want to be able to know what it means. When we are at the supermarket and see 'made in Australia from local and imported ingredients', no wonder many of us feel confused. To make an informed choice the community needs clear information about where their food is coming from. How much of the product is local? Was it all made in Australia, and does that change depending on what season it is made in? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that we are discussing today are primarily intended to simplify the tests used to justify claims like 'made in' by clarifying what 'substantial transformation' means and removing the confusing 50 per cent production cost test, which becomes redundant for food products with the introduction of labels showing the percentage of Australian ingredients. This legislation is putting in place a system so that if a business makes a country-of-origin claim for a product and it is alleged to be misleading, deceptive or false, that business has an automatic defence to the allegation if it can show that the product meets the safe harbour defence for that claim. The bill also creates a new safe harbour defence for products labelled in accordance with information standards, so that businesses can have more certainty about the labelling they can make without breaking the law. So, as far as these changes go, we support the legislation before the chamber today. However, I would like to quickly mention the important work of the Australian Greens on country-of-origin labelling and the ongoing fight for transparency and the consumer right to know, particularly in regard to food and agriculture products. Clearer food labelling is good for public health, the environment and local farmers. It gives them the extra tool to enable them to compete in our globalised marketplace. The Greens recognise that food-labelling laws should not be dictated by global food and beverage giants or the big corporations in the city. If you are a local Australian farmer working with your local co-op, you do not have the clout or power that those global corporations have. But that does not mean that your concerns should be considered to be less significant than the claims that are being put by the global manufacturers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are better informed about where our food is coming from, we can trust that it is going to be top-quality produce that we know we can rely on from Australian food producers. We can be clear about where internationally sourced ingredients have come from so that you can make an informed choice. You can decide that, no, you do not want to be buying produce from somewhere that you are a bit suspicious of. You can make the choice and say, 'No. I would prefer to pay that little bit extra'—to be supporting Australian farmers, to be supporting food production that you know is being well regulated and manufactured, with food being grown in a sustainable way. You know you can be supporting that farm production where you can be sure that there can be a spotlight on it, if required, to make sure it is being done in a sustainable and healthy way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having good country of origin labelling will also encourage people to consume more fresh produce. By thinking more about the origins of the food, we automatically eat in a way that is healthier and more ethical. So, again, if you are deciding about a cheap tin of tomatoes that you have suspicions about because of where it has come from, you can decide maybe it would be better to buy the fresh tomatoes that you know have come from the market garden only tens of kilometres away. You know that you can have more confidence in the health and sustainability of how that food is being produced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, by giving consumers information about where their food has come from and by encouraging locally produced produce to be squarely compared with other produce, it means it is much more likely that consumers are going to decide that, yes, it is worth paying what may be just a little bit extra to buy that Australian produce. That means it is going to be contributing to reducing the pollution that causes global warming. If we are buying more locally produced produce we are not flying ingredients and food from the other side of the world and paying the transport costs involved in that. Having really good food labelling helps us to better understand how far our food ingredients have travelled to our plates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the examples I often use is: when I am buying lentils and you have two packets of lentils on the shelves and you have to get out your glasses to look at the difference between these lentils. With the lentils grown in Canada, I think, 'Fine. Terrific. People in Canada, go ahead and eat those lentils.' For people in the US, it would be appropriate to eat those lentils. If, on the other hand, you look the next little bit along the shelf and you have exactly the same product that is made in Australia, I will always go for that made-in-Australia product. For those sorts of choices, by giving information to consumers, you have the ability to be really supporting our local food-growing industries. So our farmers and our food producers will be the beneficiaries then of that strong, local demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a step in the right direction, but clearly there is further to go to make sure that our food is labelled clearly and more efficiently. As well as supporting this bill before the house today, we call on our colleagues to support the Greens plan for country-of-origin labelling so that we can create more sustainable local jobs and allow everybody to make more informed choices about choosing the food that they eat.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. This bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, altering country-of-origin labelling and safe harbour provisions under Australia consumer law. The main change that this bill makes is for the labels for most food that is grown, produced or made in Australia to include a logo—a kangaroo in a triangle symbol—as well as a bar chart and text statement to show the proportion of Australian ingredients. Australians are entitled to know exactly where their food comes from. Labor supports this amendment. Buying Australian is the best way to secure quality food. Labor remains willing to work with Mr Turnbull and his colleagues to improve our country-of-origin labelling requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, perhaps the Liberals should think more broadly about their neglect of biosecurity and Australian manufacturing, which is putting jobs at risk and taking our economy backwards. Come to think of it, this is not the only thing going backwards under this government. 2017 began for Malcolm Turnbull much the same as 2016 ended, with scandal, humiliation, disappointment and division. After what was a pretty unimpressive year, I think it is fair to say that Mr Turnbull and his Liberals really needed to put their tails between their legs and hit the reset button over the summer break. And there has been more. Of course, we had Senator Bernardi defecting from his government, the Liberal Party, yesterday. But here we are in the first parliamentary sitting week of 2017 and the government is still fumbling around, unable to figure out where they stand, what they stand for and which way is up. To be fair, there are some people out there who were inclined to cut Mr Turnbull some slack last year. He was finding his feet after limping across the 2016 election finish line, but it has been almost 18 months now since the Prime Minister knifed Mr Abbott in the back. Enough is enough. If Malcolm Turnbull has anything resembling a policy agenda or a plan for 2017, now would be a really good time to tell us about it.</span>

                    </a>  After a very, very mediocre 2016, you would think that Mr Turnbull would have kicked off 2017 with a new agenda, a plan—a first draft, even. But, unfortunately, this was not the case. Mr Turnbull addressed the Press Club last Wednesday, and things just seemed to go from bad to worse for the Prime Minister after that speech, culminating, as we know, with Senator Bernardi defecting from the Liberal Party yesterday. So the circus continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say it is a good thing for Mr Turnbull that there is not an election this year, because, having achieved so little since becoming Prime Minister, most of us are scratching our heads wondering what the point of this government is and what the good reason was for sending us to a double dissolution at the last election. We are all still wondering that. Support for Mr Turnbull's government is freefalling, their popularity is slipping, and I personally think that one good reason for that is that they are so out of touch. We know that everything they touch is stuffed up, so how can we rely on them to handle even a piece of legislation like this? In stark contrast to Labor, the Liberals have kicked off this year with no direction, no plan and, above all, no narrative. Mr Turnbull has said over and over that his government is a government of the 21st century, that it is agile and innovative and that there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian, but the only thing that resonates with people in Australia—particularly in my home state of Tasmania—the thing that they are utterly disappointed with, is this dithering and dysfunctional government. Mr Turnbull is a Prime Minister who gave hope to so many in the community, but there are so many people now who are utterly disappointed.</span>

                    </a>  I am speaking about the bill and—as you said, Deputy President—I am putting it in the context of a government that is so out of touch and so dysfunctional. I know that this is a veiled attempt from those on the other side to give Mr Turnbull some cover. As I said in my speech last night, I am ashamed to sit in this chamber with a government that has attacked some of the most vulnerable people in the community—the people who this government has been hurting most in this country over the last summer period, with the dysfunction of the Centrelink robo-debt recovery crisis and the fact that this government is putting ordinary, everyday Australians who need a helping hand into the hands of debt collectors.</span>

                    </a>  Then they came in here last night—and now we have them interjecting—trying to say that we support the rorting of Centrelink. There is nothing further from the truth, and that is such an insult to everyone in this chamber. There is not an Australian—except those who may be caught rorting—who does not believe that only those people who deserve to get Centrelink payments should have access to them. But, no, they continued to send out letters to innocent Australians—and we know, and the government are now very much aware, that 40 per cent of those letters were inaccurate. I spoke last night about the Tasmanians who have been caught up in this dysfunctional government's shambolic attempt to rein back money from those people who can least afford it. Once your name is on the debt collectors' database, it is extremely difficult to have it removed. </span>

The Australian people already know; what I am trying to do is put context into the legislation that is before us. We have these scandals that have been perpetrated by those on that side of the chamber. One of their colleagues, Senator Bernardi—who came into this Senate chamber at the same time as I did, in the 2005 class—obviously has little confidence in this government being able to bring any sort of legislation through this chamber.</span>

They do not want to hear about that, but I am going to continue, because, Madam Deputy President, you very well know that in the past those opposite have spoken many times on pieces of legislation and given context to the government's inability to govern this country.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I indicate my support for the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. This has really been a long and winding road. Back in 2008, in my first few months in the Senate, I managed to convince my then colleague Senator Bob Brown, the Leader of the Australian Greens, and Senator Barnaby Joyce from the Nationals to co-sponsor a bill on truth in country-of-origin labelling. We produced a minority report—it was effectively a dissenting report—when the major parties effectively said, 'We don't want to go down this path.' I think it says something about the nature of the issue when you can have both the Greens and the Nationals on a unity ticket co-sponsoring legislation, co-writing a minority report about the need for truth in labelling in this country. It has been a long time coming, but we have seen some real improvements in the system. However, I believe there is scope for more significant improvements, and I will speak to amendments in relation to that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear that Australians want to buy Australian. In fact, a survey published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> a couple of days ago indicated overwhelmingly that Australians favour Australian made goods, things made here in Australia, and that sentiment is even stronger when it comes to the food that we eat. Multiple surveys have shown that Australians want to buy Australian products, products which use ingredients grown in Australia and which contribute to the Australian economy through jobs and the clean, green produce that Australia is so justifiably famous for. We know this through surveys going back many years. Back in 2005 an Auspoll survey found that 97 per cent of Australians wanted to have clear information on the country of origin of their foodstuffs. A 2009 survey found that 82.5 per cent of supermarket shoppers checked most of the time whether their foodstuffs, including fruit and vegetables, were Australian in origin. In other words, consumers are aware of this. We must have clear, simple, straightforward country-of-origin labelling laws so that consumers can make an informed choice when they are rushing through the supermarket. If they have toddlers or other children with them and they are in a mad rush, they want to get in and out of the supermarket, but they want to be able to make an informed choice as easily as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think it is important to put into perspective that the 50 per cent production cost test, the substantial transformation test, has inherently been a failure. You can claim a product was made in Australia even though the majority of ingredients could have come from overseas. I am very grateful to my friend and constituent Ron Gray, a former citrus grower from Loxton in the Riverland, who has been a tireless campaigner on the issue of food labelling and the impact that poor food labelling has had on the citrus industry, which has shrunk over the years rather than expanded, as it should have, with so much of our citrus juice coming from Brazilian concentrate. Ron Gray made the point that the laws were actually killing off the citrus industry. You could have a fruit juice with 70 per cent Brazilian concentrate and a minority of Australian juice and you add the water and do the packaging, and that easily passes the 50 per cent substantial transformation test—and that is a disgrace. Ron Gray told me not so long ago, as he was winding up his citrus production in Loxton, that he sent fruit to a processing plant in Mildura across the border. The money he received for that fruit barely covered the cost of the transport. In other words, he got a zero net return for his fruit. That is a disgrace, and I hope this bill goes some way to rectifying it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in 2012, the inquiry by Senate Select Committee on Australia's Food Processing Sector, chaired by former senator, Senator Colbeck, showed a number of anomalies that occur with food labelling in this country. Seafood labelling is an issue that is particularly prone to abuse. There are serious concerns about our current labelling regime, which allow foreign imports to be classified as 'Made in Australia'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its submission to this bill, the Australian Made Campaign Limited stated that overall it 'supports the removal of the 50 per cent cost test'. However, it noted some concerns that 'it may result in adverse consequences for some Australian suppliers of inputs'. It noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will occur where a manufacturer opts to source cheaper inputs offshore, knowing that it will not affect their capacity to make a Made in Australia claim. An example of this is a manufacturer of soft gel capsules who currently purchases gelatin from an Australian manufacturer because it assists them to meet the 50 per cent threshold. The local packaging industry may also be impacted adversely by this change.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are issues that ought to be fairly raised in the committee stages of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue was recognised in the committee report, and I think there is a need for greater guidance as to what does or does not constitute substantial transformation. The committee noted the concerns of the AMCL and that there was currently no mechanism by which manufacturers could obtain a definitive answer regarding country-of-origin claims and that this could result in companies being hesitant to make a claim for fear that competitors would challenge its validity. Whilst not making a submission on this bill, the consumer group CHOICE stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, the new system looks less useful for consumers wanting information about any of the 195 countries that are not Australia. For example, claims such as 'Made in Australia from imported ingredients' will still have you wondering where your food comes from …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is one of the big flaws of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to ensure there is a mechanism to give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on country-of-origin labelling claims. There is no such mechanism in the current bill. It is something that needs to be prosecuted or explored in the committee stages. I will be moving a second reading amendment standing in my name, which adds, at the end of the motion, 'but the Senate calls on the government to undertake an analysis of the benefits of establishing an administrative mechanism to give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on country-of-origin labelling claims'. If we do not do that, this bill will only to half a job. It will be nowhere near as effective as it ought to be to give the truth in labelling and to give certainty to our food manufacturing sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing the decimation of manufacturing jobs in this country. In our auto sector, when Holden closes down on 20 October in South Australia and when Toyota closes down at about the same time and as car makers close down in Victoria, there will be tens of thousands of jobs lost. We need to have a plan B, and the food-processing sector has enormous potential to absorb a significant number of those job losses. It is also important, in the definition of 'substantial transformation', that we have an administrative mechanism similar to what exists in the United States, which will give manufacturers the ability to obtain a ruling on country-of-origin claims. That is something that, as I said, with the second reading amendment, needs to be explored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that this bill, on balance, does advance the issue of certainty in food labelling, but there is one other issue that I raised in my additional comments to this bill. There ought to be a mechanism for manufacturers to regularly disclose the percentage and country of origin of specific ingredients to the department of industry, for publication on its website. A lot of manufacturers will say, 'We can't do this. It's too complex. It's too difficult because we have to change our labels all the time.' There is a thing called the internet. If they are required to publish online to the department so that, every six months, consumers can establish exactly what the percentage of whatever ingredients are in there is from Australia or elsewhere then that will empower consumers. It will also give a lot of useful information to the media that can be publicised about which manufacturers are making every possible effort to deal with these issues. That is why I will be moving an amendment in that regard. If there is political will, it can and should be done to really strengthen the framework of this bill.</span>

That is why this bill is so important, particularly in the context of Australians wanting to know what they are eating and where it comes from and also in the context of the impact it has on Australian jobs and our food processing sector and on Australian agriculture.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a significant issue that deserves more attention than trendy issues like same-sex marriage. I am fed up with the amount of time and attention that is now being given to the same-sex marriage debate in this place and in mainstream media. A solution to same-sex marriage, Indigenous recognition, and euthanasia for the terminally ill is simple: we hold a referendum and two plebiscites on the day of the next federal election and hear what Australians have to say on these important issues of the conscience, without the exorbitant and onerous costs and without the interference of mainstream media. I believe there is an opportunity to put a private member's bill before the Senate which gives the people, at the next federal election, an opportunity to have their say on those three very important social and moral issues: same-sex marriage, Indigenous recognition, and euthanasia for the terminally ill. End of story—now let's get on with running this country and talking about matters which concern people in rural and regional areas, especially like where I am, on the north-west coast of Tasmania.</span>

The definitive report on this matter, according to the Parliamentary Library study, was the Blewett review. The library report says: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Blewett Review noted that there was a general level of consumer uncertainty about 'claims to the 'Australian-ness' of a product' and acknowledged that a Newspoll survey conducted in April 2010 reported that '63 per cent of respondents incorrectly identified the originating source of a product where the term 'Made in Australia' was used'. The Blewett Review concluded:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The confusion is compounded by the 'Australian owned' claim and by a flood of `Australian Made' logos...

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that for foods bearing some form of Australian claim, a consumer-friendly, food-specific country of origin labelling framework, based primarily on the ingoing weight of the ingredients and components (excluding water), be developed.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of the three above recommendations in relation to country of origin by the Blewett Review, the Government did not support two of them and merely 'noted' another (the recommendation to extend mandatory country of origin labelling requirements to all primary food products for retail sale).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I, like many other Australians, am trying to work out why a government would spend all this money on a report which was basically ignored. Why? Was it a case of political donations unduly influencing good government policy? I note that a lot of effort has been put into the description of a 'Made in Australia' logo with a little kangaroo. I have to say, I think most of us do love Skippy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am more interested in making sure that a logo which screams 'Made in Tasmania' is given more attention. The Tasmanian brand is better than Australia's. My home state of Tasmania is renowned right around the world for its fresh produce. Our salmon is some of the best in the world, and our dairy products are second to none. And if you have not had a tender, medium rare Cape Grim steak yet, I tell you what, you have not lived. People travel from all over the world to Tasmania to experience the clean, green produce that only Tasmania can provide. Tasmanian producers are passionate, innovative and hardworking people. They pour their hearts and souls into their own products, because a lot of these products are niche. Our air is the most pure in the world, and our soil is the richest. Our biosecurity measures are top notch, to ensure we maintain that clean, green image. But we need to do more to protect the Tasmanian brand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill achieves greater protections by creating clarity around whether a product is entirely made, produced, grown or packaged in Australia or whether it is only partially 'made' in Australia. Under the new bill, the public is empowered to make their own decision and will not feel misled by claims such as 'Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients', when food is only minimally processed in Australia, as they have felt in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill requires corporations to be transparent and upfront with the consumer and therefore it protects our farmers and our producers. The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association also supports strong country-of-origin labelling and says that this bill increases the information available to the consumer, allowing them to make more informed decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just before I finish, I have to say that I did not realise that the labelling in the supermarkets to let you know where the fish comes from is due to Senator Macdonald. I always pay credit where credit is due: kudos to you, Senator Macdonald. That is a great job, and I mean that. People need to know where their seafood is coming from. If we have got that far, maybe we can now get to the fish and chip shops and the restaurants so people know exactly where the seafood is coming from.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I might start where Senator Lambie finished—and Senator Xenophon made mention of this too. That is, some years ago when I was the minister for fisheries—I did not do it all by myself—but the department in conjunction with other regulatory authorities implemented the arrangement that all fish sold in supermarkets had to be labelled, whether it was Australian or from another country. I think I am like many Australians these days, who go into a supermarket and can see where the seafood comes from. I can say, 'Do I want to buy Australian king prawns, which look lovely but it $36 a kilo? Am I conscious of my pocket and so I will take the imported poorer-looking prawns from Vietnam at about $28 a kilo?' That is my choice as a consumer. That is the way it should be. I agree with Senator Lambie and Senator Xenophon on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Xenophon quite rightly mentioned the arrangement in the Northern Territory—states and territories can make their own rules on labelling—where the government, to its credit, did do that in restaurants, and it worked. It has been difficult to get agreement from all the authorities in Australia. I would like to pay tribute to the current minister for fisheries, Senator Ruston, who I know is very keen to ensure that Australians know what they are buying when they go to a fish and chip shop or, more importantly, to a restaurant or to a club or pub. With those last two, the issue sometimes becomes a little more difficult for reasons which might be obvious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, pubs and clubs sell meals as an adjunct to their main purpose of selling booze or poker machines—they supply food, good food, but it is mass produced and it often comes from the cheapest source. People do not go to a pub or a club to buy the very best food. If they want to do that, they go to a restaurant but they come to the pub for a beer, a bit of mateship and perhaps a go at the pokies. I accept it is difficult for pubs and clubs and other institutions to do that, but in this day and age with blackboards and computers it is easy to print off a new menu for every meal. It is not the issue that some people might think it might be—the cost that some of these businesses think it might be. I think pubs, clubs and restaurants, particularly restaurants, would benefit from this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I go into a restaurant and I see Australian fish there, I know it will be quite expensive, but I can go down the menu and say, 'Oh, there is nice Vietnam barramundi which is a little less expensive.' It is up to me. I am not wealthy, but I know what I would do: I would always, for taste and quality, go for the Australian one and pay five or 10 dollars more at a restaurant. Restaurant owners may well find that a lot of Australians would do that. A lot of people—people particularly who go to restaurants—would say: 'Look, now that I know it is Australian, I am going to pick that piece.' I know Senator Ruston is working on this—and it is not easy. Even for the clubs and pubs it would be so easy for them to put on their blackboards that you can have imported basa and chips at $10 a meal or you can have Australian barramundi at $15 a meal. I do not think that it will stop people going to pubs and clubs or choosing a meal. They might say, 'Well, I'd rather have another beer and the meal that is $10 cheaper, and so I'll have the imported basa with my beer and it'll allow me to have another beer.' That is their choice. The pubs and clubs might find that the reverse actually happens: people might go in and say, 'Would I rather have a bit of Australian fish—better, nicer and it is also helping Australian fishermen—or will I have another beer?' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is an argument that Senator Ruston is yet to win—it is not for me to speak for her, but I have spoken to her quite a lot. Like Senator Lambie, not in Tasmania but up in my neck of the woods of Queensland, I often speak to fishermen and all they want is a fair go. They simply want Australians to be able to recognise their food and, if they choose to pay a little bit more, to be able to buy it. Often you go to fish and chip shops and it is difficult to work out what sort of fish it is because it is usually covered in very thick—unfortunately for me—too tasty batter which hides the fish a bit. It would be good if we could at least have the choice. I would be happy; I think every Australian consumer and the Australian fishing industry would be happy. Retailers might just find that they are taking more across the counter because Australians would go for Australian fish even at a greater cost. So I urge support for that issue, as I do privately with Senator Ruston and the government. As I say, I have confidence in Senator Ruston continuing to support that issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this is a debate, can I just mention to Senator Lambie that I certainly agree with her—it is an awful day when we are agreeing with each other so much, Senator Lambie—that this parliament should be prioritising its agendas better. Quite frankly, I am sick of hearing about same-sex marriage. I am sick of hearing about Donald Trump, who I did not elect and who has got nothing to do with me. I am absolutely sick of it. I am sick of hearing the lies about the Barrier Reef—the absolute lies. I am sick of that. Can't we prioritise and get onto the issues that the majority of Australians actually believe in? Senator Lambie—and, again, it is for the minister to explain it better than I—there is a reason why we do not have these plebiscites at elections—and I appreciate the 'cost' argument. If you do it at an election, it becomes part of the political process and people might say, for example: 'Oh, yes, I believe in same-sex marriage so I am going to vote for it But, hang on, that is the one the Labor Party and the Greens are supporting. I don't like the Labor Party and the Greens so I am going to vote no, because I don't want to do anything to support the Labor Party and the Greens.' It gets tied up in the regular election cycle. So I think the vote you would get at a plebiscite held at the same time as an election would be skewed. It would be flawed because it would become part of the process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also agree with you that had we had some assistance from this chamber in what would, I think, be one month's time when we would have had a plebiscite on same-sex marriage that the day after that plebiscite it would be over and finished—whatever way it went. I do not want to restart that argument, but I would vote against same-sex marriage. However, if the majority of Australians said yes then I would come into this chamber and vote yes. I made that very clear. In one month's time that issue could have been resolved—but it will not be. </span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Deputy President. Again, I repeat that this is a debate in the chamber. I am simply answering something another senator raised and agreeing with that senator that this chamber should prioritise its work; it should move onto important issues—issues that are really important to all Australians; and it should not be diverted by periphery issues such as same-sex marriage, which would have been over and done with in a month's a time had this chamber not denied Australians the opportunity of expressing their views. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I again congratulate the government on bringing forward this bill about country-of-origin labelling for Australian produced products. Under the current regime, the definition of what is made in Australia or the country of origin is somewhat confusing and some of the tests that were in place were even more confusing and less helpful. This bill addresses those issues. It provides businesses with increased certainty about what activities constitute and do not constitute substantial transformation, which is the test for what is made in Australia and what is not. It will make it clear that importing ingredients and undertaking minor processes that merely change the form or appearance of the imported good, such as dicing or canning, are not sufficient to justify the 'made in' wherever claim. The 50 per cent production cost test that currently applies is an unnecessary burden on business and it means little to consumers. The test is difficult to administer, given the complexities of sourcing components through the global supply chain and the variability due to currency fluctuations. These tests in the former bill will become redundant for food products, with the introduction of labels showing the percentage of Australian ingredient. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators will be aware that the Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard 2016, which was made under the previous bill, came into effect on 1 July and is being separately tabled in a disallowable instrument in this parliament. That standard, which is the one we have been waiting for for some years, requires mandatory country-of-origin labelling for food that is sold, offered or displayed for sale in Australia. Unfortunately, it does not, for various reasons, impose labelling requirements on food sold outside Australia. This new label will help Australians, almost at a glance, work out how much of the particular product is Australian made or sourced.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the information standard, most Australian foods will need to carry a label with a clearly defined box containing a kangaroo-in-the-triangle logo to indicate that the food is grown, produced or made in Australia. It will also have—and this is the bit I like—a bar chart that indicates the proportion of Australian ingredients in the food and the box will also have a statement summarising the visual information. That bar chart will show us at a glance, as we go to the supermarket, how much of a product really is Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not see that as a protectionist policy, because many people—and I accept this—will buy their food on price. Many people who do not have big incomes or who are on welfare or who have big families will say, 'I choose that because it's cheaper,' but they will do it in the full knowledge of just how much of the particular product is really Australian and how much is not. I think that is a wonderful step forward. It has been, as one other senator in this debate commented, a long time coming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know in our party—and, I suspect, in the other parties as well—we have had debates over many years. I am sure the Labor Party would have been through this because they did nothing in the six years they were in government. But they would have come across the same complexities that we have confronted over the last 20 years that I have been here, and we have been talking about it all that time. It is a difficult situation to get right without pricing the product out of the reach of anyone through complexity of regulation. It has been difficult. I guess some will say, 'It's not perfect; we can do better.' I know the government is always keen to get any views on this. I think the place where we have landed is pretty good. I think you will find that most Australians will appreciate the ability to make an informed choice now on what food they buy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by agreeing with the committee that Senator Xenophon said has looked at this and has recommended the bill be passed. I also agree, as I explained before, with Senator Xenophon and Senator Lambie that we have to do something about seafood not in supermarkets. Thanks to a very good minister several years ago, that is already in place in the supermarkets. But in fish and chip shops, hotels, clubs and restaurants, I think we can do it without placing an unrealistic burden on those retail institutions. I wish Senator Ruston all the best as she takes that argument forward. Clearly, I support the bill. I think it is a real step forward for Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to support the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. Before speaking further, though, I want to make clear that I support Senator Macdonald's comments supporting freedom of choice because that is what is at the heart of this bill: informed freedom of choice. I also support his comments on the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, though, seeks to clarify and improve consumer law by amending schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The bill is primarily intended to simplify the tests used to justify a country of origin 'made in' claim by clarifying what the phrase 'substantial transformation' really means and by removing the 50 per cent production cost test. This bill tightens the definition of what is really Australian made in the country-of-origin food labelling requirements. It makes 'country of origin' or 'Australian made' legitimate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that this bill forms part of the government's broader country-of-origin labelling package, previously agreed by the states, along with the Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard 2016 which commenced last year. Currently, the definition of 'Australian made' is based on having at least 50 per cent Australian production cost, which leads to misleading labelling of foreign foods as 'made in Australia' when in fact they may have only been minimally processed in Australia. Under this bill, the country-of-origin labelling requirements for food will be strengthened and moved to an information standard under the Australian Consumer Law. The new labels for food will include a bar chart to indicate the proportion of Australian ingredients in the food. As part of this process, foods grown, produced or made in Australia will be identified by the traditional kangaroo-in-a-triangle Australian made symbol.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the government for adopting this measure, as this is exactly the approach Pauline Hanson's One Nation Political Party has been advocating as policy for many years. As a One Nation senator for Queensland, I am strongly committed to supporting Australian grown, packaged and manufactured goods and products, and our party is strongly committed to identifying and promoting genuinely Australian made products and exposing bogus Australian-sounding imports as frauds. Of course, this bill is just the latest in a long line of excellent One Nation policies adopted by the government. There is another one and that is coal-fired power. What a remarkable change in just three months. Sadly, our own Queensland Premier says 'no more coal-fired power stations'. So I can only express my hope that this bill is but the next of many more One Nation policies that the government will choose to adopt in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, one pressing issue regarding food imports that this bill does not consider is the allowing of contaminated foodstuffs into Australia and the blending of imported foodstuffs with Australian produce in bonded warehouses prior to importation. This wholly inappropriate practice, which may only be revealed on the label of foodstuffs as 'contains mix of Australian and imported ingredients', needs to be prohibited. Perniciously, in the case of peanuts for example, I understand that this blending prior to import inspection is done because the much cheaper imported ingredients contain levels of contaminants that do not meet Australian health standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Peanuts are notorious for absorbing any available cadmium from the soil in which they grow. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the human body and is a major cause of adult kidney failure. Thanks to the clean unpolluted Australian environment, Australian grown peanuts contain no cadmium, while Chinese peanuts, as a result of their proximity to polluting Chinese heavy industries, may be heavily contaminated with this poison. Because of the serious health risk that they pose, contaminated Chinese peanuts should be considered a prohibited import. Reprehensibly, in order to maximize profits, unscrupulous importers have sought to subvert Australia's food health standards and import restrictions by importing these cheap, cadmium contaminated Chinese peanuts and, I understand, blending them with cadmium free Australian peanuts in bonded warehouses, prior to customs inspections. Food that is imported into Australia is regulated by the Imported Food Control Act 1992 and the Imported Food Control Regulations 1993. Together, these statutes provide for the Food Inspection Scheme. Currently all imported peanuts are classified as a risk food as a result of the danger of cadmium contamination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though all food products ultimately offered for sale in Australia must meet our health standards, experts have argued that in some areas, such as heavy metal contamination, health regulations may reflect 1950s 'acceptable' contamination limits and are seriously out of date. Thus, while schedule 19 of the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code sets the maximum allowable level of cadmium that may be contained in peanuts as 0.5mg/kg, given that virtually any cadmium—any cadmium—consumed remains in the body for life, most medical experts today argue that there are no truly safe levels of cumulative toxins like cadmium, and therefore the safest course is to avoid any food exposure at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, whilst it goes beyond the scope of the bill currently under consideration, I strongly urge the government to outlaw practices such as the blending of Australian and imported goods prior to food safety testing, and to declare peanuts containing cadmium a prohibited import. This will eliminate a very real and totally unnecessary threat to the health of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the information of the Australian people, to my knowledge only Dick Smith brand peanut butter is made with exclusively Australian peanuts, which are of course cadmium free. Until such time as this issue is addressed and cadmium contaminated peanuts are declared a prohibited import, I urge all Australians who value their kidneys to read the country-of-origin label on peanuts and eat only safe Australian grown peanuts, and consider buying only Dick Smith brand peanut butter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While supportive of this legislation, I believe we as a parliament need to address the core issue for bringing back Australian food production, both in quality and quantity, and bringing back manufacturing. After 42 years of de-industrialisation under Liberal/National coalitions and under Labor/Greens coalitions, we must re-industrialise our country. To re-industrialise we must face up to the core issue: comprehensive tax reform at the state and federal levels, instead of window-dressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, to continue with Senator Macdonald comments on the fishing industry, it is my understanding that this island on which we live is the largest in the world and yet we import almost three-quarters of the seafood we eat. All that Australian farmers, fishermen and manufacturers want is a fair go. Ultimately, this bill gives people an informed freedom of choice. Notwithstanding the issues of toxins and tax, I otherwise commend this legislation to the Senate.</span>

My brother, Peter, and I had a 100-sow piggery, feeding about 1,000 pigs a day and I found it quite frustrating that they would import pig meat into Australia, process it into ham, and brand it 'Manufactured in Australia' or 'Product of Australia'. It was so misleading. All I wanted was a fair go to see that the Australian people knew what they were buying—whether it was grown in Australia, processed in Australia, imported, processed here from Australian and imported blends et cetera.</span>

During the berry contamination issue about 18 months ago, where many Australians contracted hepatitis because of some imported berries, I stood up in the joint party room—Senator Sinodinos was there—and said to the then Prime Minister, 'Mr Abbott, we need a country-of-origin food labelling system so that people can clarify what they are buying and eating.' To his full credit, Mr Abbott said, 'Let's get on with it.' That is where we have come to right along this road of country-of-origin labelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be good to see the Australian kangaroo and the green triangle—a very well-known label that is very familiar, I would say, to all shoppers in Australia. It will have 'Grown in Australia' and the bar code underneath will be completely orange. You will know that the food you are about to eat for the can of whatever you are purchasing was grown, processed and packaged here in Australia. It will show the blends that will come forward—what percentage is actually made from imported ingredients and from Australian ingredients. I must agree with Senator Macdonald as far as the fishing industry goes. Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you were on a committee with us in the Northern Territory. What a great thing it is that Northern Territorians know exactly where their fish is coming from—70 per cent imported. I think that is where we need to make progress as well, on that very issue. All we are asking is that people know what they are eating and where it comes from. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  We all know in this place that those of us in parliament are, quite rightly, the subject of full accountability and transparency. My contribution today, unfortunately, reflects the fact that I do not think the same standards are being applied to Australia's judiciary. I am very concerned about this, and I want to draw it to the attention of the chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude my comments with a reference to the Nagle case in the High Court of Australia between the Rottnest Island Authority and Nagle in the 1990s, but I want to lead off this discussion with the regrettable incidents that led to the Lindt cafe siege on 15 December 2014. The gentleman involved, Man Monis, had been the subject of the courts: in 2009, the New South Wales court, because he had been writing letters to the families of deceased soldiers and others; in 2011, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Sydney; and in 2014 he goes to the High Court of Australia on a postal service related matter. In May 2014, the man is granted bail by Magistrate Joan Baptie in New South Wales, despite her acknowledging that he may endanger the safety of victims, individuals and the community and that he may interfere with witnesses or evidence. She grants the man bail because she thought there were 'significant flaws in the Crown's case'. In October 2014, this man is again charged, this time with 40 sexual assault charges against six women. He applies for bail; Magistrate Dorelle Pinch gives him bail. He is due back in court on 12 December, which is deferred to February 2015. In the meantime, he causes the Lindt cafe siege and the death of two innocent people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to 2 November 2016. In Queensland, Magistrate Trevor Morgan is in the Pine Rivers judiciary. Three young women are apprehended on the roof of the office of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton. This is the magistrate's comment to them in finding them guilty:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… if one of my daughters was caught doing like you did, I'd probably be very proud of her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He fines them $100, despite more than $10,000 of legal and police costs. What happens on 29 November, two weeks later? At least one, if not more, of those young women are down here in Parliament House vandalising furniture and disrupting question time in the other place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to the Gargasoulas incident in Bourke Street in Melbourne, on 20 January. Again, this is not an incident I want to speak about in great detail. What do we find there? This gentleman, with a long history of domestic violence, had been granted bail over and above the pleas and objections of the police. He was due to appear in court on that same day, 20 January, but what did he do? We all saw it, so I will say it: he allegedly committed a heinous crime in which, to date, six people have been killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only the other day, when I was in Queensland for a Senate hearing, I heard about the tragic death of Teresa Bradford on 31 January, only a week ago. In November 2016, her estranged husband is placed into custody because of what would be alleged to be a horrific attack on her, and yet, in the middle of January, the gentleman is granted bail, again over the urgent pleas of the police. She is not warned of the fact that he has been let out on bail. On 31 January she is murdered and he suicides in front of their four children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the question: what is bail all about? The act instructs the court to start with the presumption that an accused person should be granted bail unless there is a justified reason to refuse it. What might the reasons be? The nature and the seriousness of the crime; the character of the defendant; past criminal record; association; ties with the community; the defendant's record in regard to previous commitments to bail; the strength of the evidence—where are the words relating to the victim in all of this and in the cases that I have referred to? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nagle was a most interesting case, and it led to the rewriting of public liability practice in this country. In 1977, Mr Nagle was an employee at Rottnest Island in Western Australia. As you, Senator Sterle, would know as well as I do, there is a place called The Basin there. Tens of millions of people have swum at The Basin; it is probably the safest spot to swim. The man goes to The Basin on a Saturday morning. Instead of going straight into the water he walks 50 metres over sharp rocks and dives into the water and comes out a quadriplegic. It was absolutely tragic, and I am not suggesting the Australian community should not support him. I was the chief executive at Rottnest Island when he brought an action against the island authority on the public liability basis that there should have been a sign to say there were rocks. You know, as I know, the island is a rock—as Senator Cash also well knows. We won the case in the Supreme Court in 1989. There was an appeal to the appeals court in Perth. We won that in 1991, and yet it went to the High Court of Australia in 1993 and it was lost. I begged and pleaded to be allowed to be a witness before the High Court of Australia, as the chief executive of the island authority, and was not allowed to do so. So we went from being zero per cent culpable to 100 per cent culpable in that case. It cost the island authority millions of dollars in legal costs and in the public liability space, and it changed things completely. It is the reason why playgrounds were pulled out of schools and removed by local governments around Australia—because, on the basis of the Nagle case, public liability payments were made. The then governor of the state, Sir Francis Burt, a person known to Senator Cash and her family, had been the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He said to me, 'Chris, I'll tell you two things. Firstly, it will be seen as the worst judgement in the history of the High Court. Secondly, it won't help you, but over time they will pull out the planks in the platform.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was talking on one occasion to retired High Court judge Sir Ronald Wilson as we walked along the Canning River in Mount Pleasant, and I said to him, 'Sir Ronald, if you were still on the High Court of Australia, we wouldn't have lost the case.' And he said, 'Chris, why would you say that?' I said, 'Because the information available to me, Sir Ronald, is that the justices of the High Court took the basin at Rottnest to be akin to the gap in Sydney, and in their minds' eyes you would obviously expect signs at the gap in Sydney.' He said to me, 'That can't be right.' I happened to be walking with him again some weeks later and he drew my attention to that conversation. He said, 'I've actually made some inquiries, Chris, and do you know you were right?' He said, 'I'm not saying the judgement swung on that, but in the minds' eyes of those justices from the eastern states of Australia, the basin was like the gap in Sydney.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so we had a circumstance then where not only did we go from being zero per cent culpable to 100 per cent culpable, but the High Court got it wrong. But there is no right of appeal to the High Court of Australia. And, as I said, we were not allowed to appear as witnesses. We were not allowed to present evidence. The very first movie ever made in the state of Western Australia was that of people swimming at the basin. The concept of putting a sign on a limestone rock called 'the island' saying 'there might be rocks here' is a nonsense. The sign, for example, might not be illuminated at night; it might not be able to be read by people who cannot read English; it might be too high for children, or too low for others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It did interest me, incidentally, that witnesses were permitted only the other day when the matter of our past colleague former Senator Bob Day was dealt with in the High Court of Australia. Then former Senator Anne McEwen had a representation of witnesses to the High Court of Australia. Our QC at the time was Michael Murray QC, who went on to become, if I am not wrong—through you, Chair, to Senator Cash—a Supreme Court judge himself. Michael Murray said to me in preparing for the case, 'Tell me why you cannot comprehend that this man has either made a mistake or that he should have known that he was amongst rocks.' I said to him, 'Michael, if I was walking across Subiaco football oval I might reasonably expect to be hit on the head by a football, but I wouldn't expect to be hit by a train. And yet if I walked over sharp rocks barefooted'—which I have done incidentally—'for 50 metres, it must surely be in my mind's eye that I am amongst rocks.' The judiciary needs to be far more transparent and far more accountable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I rise to speak about ovarian cancer, something that I am extremely passionate about. Unfortunately, this year 1,550 Australian women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and, of these, 1,200 will be tragically taken from us. In daily numbers, four women will be diagnosed and three women will die from ovarian cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, time has shown that the number of deaths from ovarian cancer has increased from 460 in 1968 to nearly three times that number in 2017. Sadly, only 43 out of 100 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer survive after five years. The mortality rate for this disease is extremely high, as ovarian cancers are highly aggressive and especially difficult to treat, and consequently generally carry a poor prognosis. Ovarian cancer remains a silent killer, with two-thirds of women diagnosed in the advanced stage of the disease. A new test for ovarian cancer would be an amazing breakthrough, because there is currently no clear way to detect the disease at an early stage. Early detection is the key to survivability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy in Australian women and carries a very poor prognosis. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when the tumour has spread beyond the ovary and, despite efforts to develop better screening processes, more than eighty percent of ovarian cancers have spread beyond the ovary prior to diagnosis. Ovarian tumours do not only consist exclusively of cancer cells but contain a complex mix of other cell types that makes treatment a very complicated process. Current research has shown that these other cells in solid tumours are able to interact with cancer cells, influencing their behaviour to make them even more aggressive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, there is no screening test to detect early ovarian cancer. Most women have advanced disease when they are diagnosed. In advanced ovarian cancer, cancer cells have spread in the bloodstream or lymphatic system to other areas of the pelvis, or to tissues and organs outside the pelvis. Greater understanding of how ovarian cancers develop and new therapies are urgently needed. Treatment is complicated and, depending on the stage and progression of the disease, radical surgery is usually performed to remove the cancer, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Targeted therapy can be used with medicines that are designed to specifically attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. These types of medicines affect the way that cancer cells grow, divide, repair themselves or interact with other cells. Despite all the treatment regimes, ovarian cancer can recur after treatment. The cancer can re-present in the pelvis or anywhere else in the body.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It can be difficult to diagnose ovarian cancer because the symptoms are ones that many women will have from time to time, and they are often symptoms of less serious and more common health problems. But we do know that ovarian cancer is not a silent disease. Women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer report four types of symptoms most frequently: abdominal or pelvic pain; increased abdominal size or persistent abdominal bloating; the constant need go to the bathroom, sometimes urgently; and feeling full after eating a small amount. If you experience any of these symptoms, if they are new for you and you have experienced them multiple times during a four-week period, go to your GP. With a greater awareness and understanding of the symptoms of ovarian cancer, women can seek medical treatment at an earlier stage, significantly increasing their chance of survival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As any person with ovarian cancer will tell you, any cancer diagnosis also impacts family members and friends. Sometimes the complex feelings and lifestyle changes caused by cancer and its treatment become as overwhelming for others in your life as they are for you. Cancer has the greatest effect on marriages and other long-term partnerships. After a cancer diagnosis both individuals may experience sadness, anxiety, anger or even hopelessness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an illness that consumes families, and in Australia one woman dies every 10 hours from ovarian cancer. The key to changing this statistic and giving women with ovarian cancer a better long-term outlook is early detection. It is very clear that the most effective way of identifying and combating ovarian cancer is through screening and genetic marker testing. It is critical that research be funded adequately to develop diagnostic detection screening tests for ovarian cancer. Early diagnosis is critical in combating ovarian cancer, allowing women to be treated in the first stages of the cancer. This will certainly increase survivability for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Researchers are working hard to learn more about ovarian cancer. They are looking at how you can prevent it and the best ways to deliver treatment and provide care to people diagnosed with these diseases. Some good news is that researchers have identified a specific BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation in up to 20 per cent of women with ovarian cancer. What this means is that the drug olaparib can be utilised. This drug is not a cure for the cancer but can delay the reoccurrence of the disease while preserving a good quality of life for women with advanced ovarian cancer with the BRCA gene mutation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before 2016, a small number of Australian women had accessed olaparib through clinical trials and compassionate access schemes. Since January 2016, when olaparib was approved by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration as a treatment for women with BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, those women who could afford it were able to access the drug for $13,500 for six months of treatment. Thankfully, that drug has been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as of 1 February 2017. The PBS listing means that women can now access the drug for a maximum of $38 a month. This is the most significant development in 30 years for treating advanced ovarian cancer. Treatment options for women with ovarian cancer really have not changed much since the 1980s. This new class of anti-cancer drugs, while not a cure, is a promising indication that further new and improved therapies can and will be found</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real life experiences of many women battling ovarian cancer are often not told. Gayle Doyle, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013, was given access to olaparib through a compassionate access scheme in December 2014. Gayle says it has improved her quality of life after months of chemotherapy. 'Feeling healthy and being in a positive state of mind is everything when you're fighting ovarian cancer,' Ms Doyle said. 'That's a hard thing to achieve when your body has been battered by chemotherapy, especially when the disease returned so soon after the initial round of treatment. With olaparib, I have hope. I will be celebrating our daughter's wedding in eight weeks. Two years ago I had grave doubts concerning my survival; therefore, this joyful occasion is extra wonderful for our family.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks must also go to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for reviewing and considering the position statement of Ovarian Cancer Australia, which called upon the Australian Government to facilitate affordable access to much-needed new treatments. I am very proud of the women, including Gayle, who were supported by Ovarian Cancer Australia to attend a patient hearing to discuss the value of the drug to them and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None the less, it is the continuing responsibility of this government to provide more funding to support research in the early diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. It is also mandatory for this government to provide the necessary medical research infrastructure and services to combat this disease and accelerate diagnosis and treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the month of February I encourage all members and senators to help raise awareness of this deadly disease and to encourage everyone in their community to 'know, ask, act'. That is, to know the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer, ask for medical advice if you do have any of these symptoms, and act to improve the lives of women living with ovarian cancer. Please remember that the whole month of February is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  I rise, once again, to speak on the Turnbull government's disastrous Centrelink automated debt recovery system. I have had many people contact my office with their experiences of the impact of this system. Their experiences demonstrate the distress and confusion that this system is causing in the community. I would like to share some of those stories today. I might add that these are just three of the many examples that we have received. I am not going to identify anybody in these contributions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am a 35-year-old woman with chronic physical and mental illness. I am only able to work 15 hours a week, so I am dependent on my Newstart payments to survive. After paying rent, I have $30 a day to live on in Sydney. I try to do the right thing, and when I am working I make sure I report any income I earn to Centrelink. But now I have received a debt of $2,000 plus that I don't even owe, plus a recovery fee, all because I worked for a few months in 2010 before going on Newstart in 2011 after I left a job. I did not declare my income from the job because it ended a month before I went onto Centrelink. But the Centrelink computer system seems to think that they have overpaid me, despite a letter from my former employer and bank statements proving I'm correct. Nobody at Centrelink has been able to fix this mistake. I'd like to tell you what my last three days have been like, and then you can decide if the system is working well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Day three of Centrelink nightmare. A dozen phones calls; at least an hour on hold each time. Websites that don't work; documents that won't upload despite trying multiple times; income reassessments that are repeatedly rejected because the documents won't upload; following detailed directions from staff that lead to nothing, and they can't tell me why; calling employers from seven years ago for payslips that no longer exist; being told I have no record of any debt; being told that I owe $2,000-plus because the computer system can't comprehend people only working for part of the year and averages out their income, so it looks like they've been overpaid when they haven't; being told my debt was waived yesterday; being told I still have a $2,000-plus debt, plus a 10 per cent recovery fee, and if I don't start paying it by 9 February it will be handed on to debt collectors; one screaming nervous breakdown; several hours of feeling suicidal, and three calls to Lifeline.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I am now too ill to work, and have been given a doctor's certificate for two weeks off. What did I do to deserve this? Does this sound like a system that's working well?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second example:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">First letter that came out was asking for tax returns from 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. This was asked from me two years ago, so I didn't get why it was asking again. Went to local office to ask why on earth it was asking for them once more, and on my records there was no note of it being asked. So was told not to worry about it; if they wanted it they'd ask again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On the 1st December I received a notice of debt of approximately $5,300 with a due date of 28 days to be paid from tax years 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012, and a recovery fee of approximately $480. Also, on the 1st December I received a letter that stated that I earned too much money as of July 2011 and Centrelink had stopped my payments and owed me $50.80. Are you as confused as I am? But wait, there's more. Pretty much I have evidence to prove this is a farce. I have to write up a notebook of why it's wrong. In the meantime, I have to pay back a non-existing debt until I take this to the highest I can go to get this system recognised as the way wrong and as not working. By the time I do that, others who have paid without questioning might see what's happening and ask for a review of their supposed debts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And to add to all this, I'm on Centrelink as of only November 2016. Three weeks later I receive this debt. I am having to deal with it while having had spinal surgery on the 5 January 2017 and going through recovery. So that's why I'm on sickness benefits at present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have another example:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am a student who has been receiving youth allowance then Austudy for the past three years during my undergrad. Received a letter asking to confirm my employment income at the beginning of December. The system didn't give me an opportunity to confirm my fortnightly income, so it averaged out my annual income when I went from full-time, earning a higher amount before study, down to part time when studying, earning a lower amount. It then spat out a debt of $3,178.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I then spoke to someone at Centrelink and they helped me add in my fortnightly income amounts for that financial year. They said it would take two weeks for a decision to be made. A week later, on 21 December, they sent me a new letter saying 'The previously calculated amount has been changed. The new amount is $14,733. This replaces the previous notice.' No reason, no explanation, just: here's a new bill for $14k. I'll hopefully get some kind of response when I call them today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are three examples of people affected by this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also had people who work within the system contact me. This is an example—I will not get through all of it but I will give you the bones of what they say as much as I can. This person who works within the system says: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I actually work in the local DHS service centre. I see the effects of this horrendous data-matching tool on a daily basis and I would be more than happy to have a conversation about it. However, the main reason for this contact is my view that Centrelink is at the verge of quite a spectacular implosion. The main cause of this is the complete lack of staffing, but even more so the tools that we have to use. Not only are we mandated to move to an operating system named Customer First, which has been very cumbersome and time consuming to operate and encounters major system issues almost on a daily basis; this, however, is nearly insignificant to our latest tool called Workload Manager, WLM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Most of our work comes in electronically in the form of online claims or scanned images and forms. These all go into a virtual bucket which is then allocated by the WLM to the virtual teams. The trouble is nobody knows who does what, and there is no ownership of the work and nothing appears to be getting done. KPIs are completely out of the window. People wait six months for the aged pension carer payment. Youth allowance claims for customers that have just completed year 12—so that we cut their parents' FTB—will take several months. The amount of questions re the progress of their claims and network and rework is phenomenal. We can't tell them anything. We can't give them any indication of where their claim is being done or when it will be done. There is nobody to contact. We can mark their claim as urgent when the customer is in financial hardship, but this appears to have no effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Paperwork that customers have lodged electronically months ago to update their records simply do not appear to get done. Medicare is getting much the same way. Delays in progress are literally getting longer by the day to the extent that things are completely out of control. Meanwhile, staff are severely overworked and, as a thank you, we haven't had a collective agreement or pay rise for three years as the government keeps stalling negotiations with unreasonable offers to take a lot of our working conditions and safeguards away in return for a below-inflation pay rise. In the meantime, the government has legislated that pay rises can't be retrospective, so there is no incentive to finalise the agreement. Every day they can stretch it out is saving them money. Anyway, the debt tool is atrocious and is inherently flawed, in particular where customers have not worked a full year. Even for staff it is a hard tool to negotiate, and puts customers at a very unfair disadvantage. However, the debacle is, I feel, only the tip of a bigger iceberg. Anyway, I have ranted enough and I am probably jeopardising my job even writing this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from the people who are handling the system. The way Australians are being treated is disgraceful. It is also disgraceful that the people working in Centrelink are being put in this position. I know that they are copping a lot from these people, who are so distressed, and that the stress is affecting their mental health. I urge the Prime Minister to listen to the people who are affected by this disastrous debacle and I urge my colleagues in this parliament, across the board, to listen to the Australians who are telling you how bad this system is. I think this system needs to be scrapped.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247871" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise to provide an update in relation to matters in our very important beef industry. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, that you will have a keen interest in my short report, as much of it relates to an inquiry under your chair. I am sure you will be interested in a comprehensive update. Prior to the end of last year, arrangements were made for a group, at my invitation, to travel through Western Queensland to have public meetings with producers and stakeholders in the beef production industry. The group included a senior director of the Cattle Council; the director of Meat and Livestock Australia, Mr Richard Norton; the chair of the Australian Meat Industry Council, Mr Lachie Hart; and the chair of the Australian Meat Processor Corporation, Mr Peter Noble. The meetings related principally to one of the core objectives of the Senate inquiry being undertaken: the independent assessment of meat carcasses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Agricultural production in this country will be worth over $60 billion this year, with $12.5 billion, or about 20 per cent, coming from the beef sector. It is fair to say that there are existing and emerging technologies that have not been embraced, and I think everyone concedes that they would make for a much more competitive and fairer environment in the relationship between pastoralists and producers and, of course, our processing sector. These two sectors have a very symbiotic relationship, and it will only be when they are as one in what they need to do with their industry that they will prove to be a success. It is one thing for us to have a Senate inquiry but, as you have heard me say, Mr Acting Deputy President—and I mean no adverse reflection on you, as chair, or on me, as your deputy chair—it would not be wise for the industry to leave resolutions to their problems up to a burnt-out old truck driver and a retired detective. The industry needs to repair these issues and to manage their own affairs without government being involved. Nobody wants more regulation or legislation in any sector, particularly in agriculture and particularly in the beef industry. They need to be urged to fix these things themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are issues with the Cattle Council at the moment. I do not want to reflect adversely on the Cattle Council, but it is true to make the statement that they are not, in my view, sufficiently reflective of the 40- or 50-odd thousand cattle producers in this country, and they need to be. There are things that government needs to do to support them in the transition to being a strong peak industry body. They are well and truly down the path of doing that, but it is going much slower than it should. We are now at about the eighth month. A transition body is in place, trying to agree on the finite details of how they will be funded, operated, measured and audited, but my message to them—I have said this privately and I will do so publicly—is: get on with it, get it sorted and get out there so that you can provide a very strong and cohesive voice for all the pastoralists and beef producers around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, we have problems with AMIC. Two of our biggest processors are no longer active members of the peak industry body, so, again, that peak industry body cannot speak with the authority of the whole packer sector, as it is known, or the processing sector. My message to AMIC—again, I have said this privately and I say so now publicly—is to get on with the job; get yourselves back into a position where the peak body speaks with one voice on behalf of this very important part of the industry. These problems impact on the Australian Meat Processor Corporation because they, in effect, are the research and development and marketing arm of the sector and if they do not have a cohesive peak body then, of course, decisions that they make will sometimes only reflect the views and attitudes of some of the members of the industry and not all of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While all this is happening, we have what is known as DEXA technology. It is not a new technology—it has been around for decades—but currently, in its enhanced form, it is almost ready to roll out across the beef processing industry in this country. For the first time, testing will be independent—if you accept that a platform that operates effectively and consistently is independent of human influence and interference. It certainly provides the opportunity for objective carcass testing. Why is this significantly important?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important because it does not matter where a producer's cattle are sent for slaughter; they want two things. They want to be treated fairly in terms of being paid for the commodity, and that payment is of course underpinned by a description of the carcass yield. That is the first thing they want and need. The second is that they want feedback in terms of the data that is collected through the use of this technology so that they can make on-farm decisions about breed plans and patterns, genetic selection of size, and dams and so on, right through the entire industry. What will that do? That will underpin us and continue to reinforce the reputation that Australia has in the world as being the prime producer of quality beef. Why is that important, Mr Acting Deputy President? You know the answer: we are a trade exposed nation, where over 70 per cent of the beef that is processed in this $12½ billion industry is exported. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The prospects for the further export of this commodity are very promising. We are in discussions with India, although India probably will not become our biggest purchaser of beef. Nonetheless, it is a very important potential trading partner. Of course, there is Indonesia. I have said before that, if every Indonesian took the amount of beef that they could fit on a fork each day and consumed it as part of their diet, we would not have—nor could we ever have—a sufficient number of cattle to meet their demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when we are transitioning—it is an old economy come new again—and as things taper back in the resources sector and we see agriculture becoming more significantly important to our terms of trade position and in its contribution to the GDP of our national economy, it is important that we support the industry to get themselves into the very best position that they can. I say to our government that we need to stay out of this as long as we can whilst we encourage industry and provide them with the tools, the support and the pathway to fix the issues themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon the Cattle Council and all the other stakeholders in the negotiations in transitioning to a new cattle house to get on with the job and to get on with it soon. Let us know—people like you and me, Mr Acting Deputy President—if there are some issues that they need us to intervene in. MLC needs to get itself back together so that it is a full contingent of the big processors in this country. Between them, I am certain that they will be able to provide the framework and the self-regulatory environment that will take this very strong industry and make it stronger and underpin the wealth of our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  Last Wednesday was Medicare's 33rd birthday. Our universal healthcare system, set up by Labor, has been and will continue to be defended by Labor. Over the past 33 years, successive coalition governments have tried to take Medicare apart. The Turnbull government have continued, and have indeed stepped up, their attacks and cuts to Medicare—attacks and cuts which of course affect the most vulnerable Australians, older Australians and Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Medicare's birthday last week, the Turnbull government did the most extraordinary thing: it closed its Belmont, WA Medicare office. Without notice, it just shut the doors. Let me tell you a little bit about the Belmont community to put into perspective the significance of the closure of this office. Belmont has a low SEIFA score—socioeconomic indexes for areas score—and is the second most disadvantaged local government area in Greater Perth. It has a higher than average number of people who left school before the age of 15. In the City of Belmont, the lowest quartile was the largest group in 2011, when it was measured, comprising 30 per cent of households with income. As for age, it has more people between 20 and 34 than the average, many of whom are families with children, who of course attend the doctor more than most other people, and it has a higher than average population of people over the age of 70—again, a group more likely to visit their GP and require services. It goes without saying that these people rely on Medicare and the services of their local Medicare office. Belmont has higher rates of hospitalisation for accidental falls in the elderly and, tragically, a higher rate of youth suicide among females.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the savage cuts the Turnbull government has made to cervical cancer services, women in Belmont had a low screening participation rate. Now that women will be required to pay not only for their GP visit but also for the required pathology, thanks to the Turnbull government's cuts to Medicare, I expect we will see these already low rates of participation drop even further. And for the Belmont community, and indeed all Australians, the PM's plans to increase the cost of prescription medicines and drive up out-of-pocket healthcare costs have been confirmed in the release of the Parliamentary Budget Office's report on unlegislated measures. This update confirms that the government still plans to increase PBS co-payments for general patients and concession patients and cut millions out of Medicare safety nets. The more expensive medicines become, the less likely people are to fill their prescriptions. Already, around 1.8 million Australians say they avoid filling prescriptions because of cost—this will only get worse. For many in the Belmont community, their future healthcare costs are looking very sick indeed. Belmont residents incur GP costs, as just three GPs in the area bulk-bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The closure, without notice, of the Belmont Medicare office comes off the back of the Turnbull government's increased cost of health to consumers and lack of access to bulk billed services to the Belmont community. Slamming shut the doors of this busy and well-utilised office was not expected and will create real hardships for many locals. Now, instead of their full-service Medicare office, Belmont residents are forced to suffer the indignity, embarrassment and lack of privacy of using what the government now describes as a pop-up outlet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me describe to you what a pop-up outlet is. The Belmont pop-up outlet, where local residents are expected to access Medicare services, has seven cubicles, all facing outwards. Each cubicle is divided by flimsy partitions. The Belmont pop-up, situated in the Belmont shopping centre, sits in the middle of the centre, sandwiched between Woolworths, Bakers Delight and a chicken shop. The Medicare manager described it as 'WA's first pop-up outlet.' Does that mean other Western Australian Medicare offices will be closed and a poor second-rate pop-up put in place of a full service office?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Belmont pop-up is noisy, lacking in privacy and has no waiting area, and—wait for it—cannot accommodate those Belmont residents who use motorised wheelchairs or buggies because they cannot fit into the cubicles and there is no laptop to provide any services to these Australians. It is not a full-service pop-up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For full services, Belmont residents will need to undertake at least a two-bus journey to Cannington or a drive on roads which have heavy traffic. That is something the older Australians I spoke to when I visited the Belmont shopping centre last Friday are not able to do. People in the centre doing their shopping can easily see what is on the screen, so your private data could be easily accessed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about the staff? I asked them if they felt vulnerable, standing around in the middle of a shopping centre. They told me they were not allowed to answer that question. There are no safe or secure places for them to put their belongings and nowhere private to have a break. When I asked the manager these questions, she said they could go and sit in the local coffee shop. What a disgrace. These are public servants who are entitled to certain health and safety conditions when they are at work. Whilst the seven or eight staff assigned to the former full service Belmont office are fully trained in all aspects of Medicare, they are not allowed to give advice. They can only direct customers to use on-screen services. That sounds like something out of <span style="font-style:italic;">I, Daniel Blake</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many older Australians I spoke to at Belmont had neither used a computer before nor did they have the required email address. When I was sitting there last week I met a local resident by the name of Bev, who was sitting on a public seat while she waited to access the pop-up outlet. And the staff at the pop-up, who I have to say are working under extraordinary circumstances and doing the very best they can to provide some sort of public service, went up to Bev and asked for her email address. She is a woman in her 70s, who has never used a computer, so of course she does not have an email address. That is problem No. 1 for Bev when she is trying to access her Medicare information on the screen. What a disgraceful way to treat older Australians, who have worked all their lives and who can expect, quite rightly, to be treated with respect. They should be able to get the information they require from the public servant standing next to them, who is fully trained in all aspects of Medicare and fully able to answer their questions. But now they are not allowed to because they have to stand there and help people like Bev use a computer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know how anyone calls it efficient to sit and coach somebody to use a computer when they have never used it before and when that staff member is well able and trained to do the job. It is just madness. Those Australians and any Australian have the right to expect that advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The silence of the federal Liberal member for Swan and the state member for Belmont is deafening. I have taken the time to write to Mr Tudge and cc'd in the health minister, demanding a range of answers. At this point I am still waiting for responses to my letter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was true, and what made it even worse was the instant, angry knowledge that it would be true. You just knew it. You just knew—even as far removed physically as I was—that our rotten, crumbling and increasingly deadly 'justice' system had failed the community again. It failed the way that it did with Adrian Bayley, when he was free to prowl the streets to rape and murder Jill Meagher. It failed the way it let Sean Price out to stab a defenceless, innocent, teenager, Masa Vukotic, 47 times. It failed the way it did in Brisbane, when David Bradford was let out on bail and only two weeks later stabbed his wife, Teresa, to death in front of their children, who fled next door.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How many rallies on the steps of parliament houses do disillusioned, betrayed, citizens have to hold? How many justice walks do we have to trudge on before we are heard? What did 30,000 people marching in Brunswick over the Jill Meagher murder achieve? After each brutal betrayal, I could write most premiers' speeches by cut and pasting their old ones. There is the hand-wringing, the long faces on the TV news, the appropriate condolences to victims' families and the promises—the ultimately shallow promises—that things will be different and that your anguished voices are being heard. Why should you believe them now?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the immediate horrifying aftermath of the Bourke Street Mall massacre, I thought it would be wrong to get political at a time of such numbing pain and tragedy, especially for someone who founded and has their name associated with a political movement called the Justice Party. It was why I stayed off Facebook and sent only two tweets in five days. The second one was about the other hidden scandal involving police pursuits. That tweet said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm told pursuing police had 7 chances to ram the Bourke Street killer and were denied permission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a separate issue for the coroner, but it must have added to the grief of those victims' families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said that it is not usually appropriate to get political, but we have to. Only our political leaders can repair this. The bail system must be tightened, especially in Victoria. Does it surprise any increasingly cynical and disillusioned Victorian that mine is the only state where sergeants and officers in charge only have the power to bail offenders and not remand them in custody? You have to ask, why is this so? It means that every week hundreds of police spend hours sitting in court virtually babysitting offenders, waiting for their turn to apply to have the offender remanded. When it is after hours, which it usually is, a bail justice is called in. These people are volunteers, which was the case in the Bourke Street Mall situation. When police oppose bail they do so for a reason. They take that position from experience. Their warnings of further risks to the community or the risk of flight should carry more weight, I believe, than some dangerously lightweight bail justices. Frankly, I have seen some people in that exalted position whom I would not appoint dog catcher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely, at least, the bail justice who bailed Dimitrious Gargasoulas should have been stood down or should have volunteered to stand down until the inquests. Very early in the piece, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said on radio that that would not happen. He did set up a night court. And on the first Saturday night the chief magistrate went in and symbolically sat until 9.30 pm. You ask, what about rural Victoria? Will there be night courts there too? At a moving remembrance ceremony at the GPO steps a week after the slaughter, we all stood, heads bowed, at 1.39 pm for a minute's silence. I said then that I believed the premier should recall parliament with six days notice and add just two words to the Victorian bail laws: just add the words 'or remand' to a police sergeant's bail powers—two words. I had already met with opposition leader Matthew Guy, who agreed to a recall of parliament and also had agreed with me that he would support that vital change to the bail law. Premier Andrews could have recalled parliament, had the amendment voted in and gone to the governor for royal assent, and it could have been life-saving law by 1.39 pm last Friday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After that minute's silence a week after the massacre I called Premier Andrews's office to push the case for a recall of parliament, because I knew it meant so much to millions of Victorians. I had said that Friday 20 January had shown Melbourne at its worst and an heroic aftermath had shown Melbourne at its best. I do not think Friday 27 January was Dithering Dan's finest moment. He declined to take my phone call or to call me back. Now, I know he is a busy man, but he has not called in more than 10 days. We did have this exchange of text messages, though—or at least, I should say, to be accurate, our staffers had this exchange. I got a text message saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Apologies for not coming back to you sooner. Premier has asked our Attorney-General, Martin Pakula, to meet with the Senator and run him through our recent announcement. I'll ask his office to phone you to set time for a meeting. Thank you. Olivia. Premier Andrews Office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My executive assistant, Annette Philpott, replied:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Senator understands how busy the Premier must be. But would still prefer to speak to him in the next few days rather than meet with the Attorney-General.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a nice way of saying that I would rather talk to the organ grinder than the monkey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, a couple more things: I posted a 'Jail not bail' editorial on the Justice Party Facebook page, and it reached around 200,000 people. Secondly, on the first day back in the Senate, in this first week back in the Senate, I just want to put on the record that I found the tweets from Senator Leyonhjelm about Bourke Street at that time to be untimely, insensitive, tasteless and even cruel, and I want to dissociate myself totally from them. Finally, I believe Premier Andrews should have recalled parliament, because it would have been a start to bail law revision. I do not believe that a seasoned police sergeant would have bailed Dimitrious Gargasoulas. A lot of lives may have been saved, and our city—my city—would not be going through one of its worst times ever.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  We all understand that there are significant economic challenges in my home state of Western Australia, and, speaking very frankly, there is no point trying to dance around that sensitive issue. The economic growth figures we saw late last year would indicate that those challenges are not going to ease in the short term without a lot of hard work. I will touch on some of the things the federal government is doing to deal with that situation in a few moments, but it is worth first outlining the reasons regional investment is important to Australia as a whole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the best way to begin to do that is to examine the vital economic contribution our regions are making to Australia's overall economic health, because it is vastly underappreciated just how critical that contribution is, especially in an economy whose future strength rests on its ability to diversify. Now, it is regrettable, but there remains in some quarters an ill-informed, almost snobbish assumption that the regions are a 'drag on economic activity'. In fact, the reverse is true. When you talk to most Australians—and we know that most Australians live in urban areas—and you talk about 'the economy', most of them conjure up mental images of bustling cities, cranes constructing skyscrapers and smokestacks atop factories as being emblematic of economic activity. Thus it would probably shock most Australians to learn that regional Australia accounts for around 40 per cent of Australia's economic output and is responsible for the employment of around a third of the national workforce. The value of that contribution is perhaps best illustrated this way: if you took regional Australia's contribution to economic output out of the picture, the Australian economy today would be about the same size as it was in 1997—almost 20 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also interesting to note that research by the Regional Australia Institute found that since 2001 regional Australia has gained ground on metropolitan areas in productivity terms across virtually every industry, with the possible exception of mining. As we all understand, improving productivity growth is central to growing our economy and it seems this is one area where regional Australia has much teach our metropolitan communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's success in weathering the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, which hit in the latter part of 2008, is often held up as a modern-day economic miracle. What has been less well understood is just how critical our regional communities were in helping us meet that challenge. In the years immediately following the GFC, there was a significant economic slowdown in metropolitan regions, but regional economies proved far more resilient. In fact, in those two years, half of Australia's economic growth was accounted for by regional activity. Now it is true, some of that was driven by commodity production, which was still in its boom phase at that time, but the full story is a more complex and interesting one. Given the end of the mining `boom', it also offers us some important lessons when it comes to diversifying our economy, especially for my home state of Western Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to stereotypes for a moment, I think if you asked most Australians about which industries are important to regional communities, they would respond with words like agriculture and, especially in WA, words like mining. And they wouldn't, of course, be wrong—those two areas will always be important drivers of regional economic growth. However, what has been most interesting to observe the growth that has occurred over the last decade in the services sector, especially in high-value services in the finance, health and scientific areas. Even in the years when the mining boom was at its zenith, our regional economies were becoming increasingly services-driven.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that those boom conditions no longer prevail, it is more critical than ever that, in a state like Western Australia and more generally across the Australian environment, we diversify our economic activities. We need to be focused on leveraging opportunities and confound the misguided, dangerous perception that regional economic management is about managing decline. Nothing could be further from the truth. That is why regional investment is so critical and why it forms such a large part of the Turnbull government's overall economic plan. Because the success of regional economic development in the years ahead will be determined primarily by one thing: the ability of regional communities to attract and retain residents who will be at the forefront of driving growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has always been a lot of talk about the 'potential' of regional communities. The important thing about regional investment is that as much as anything, it is a demonstration of the faith that government has in that potential; that it is not just a buzzword, but something tangible. As political representatives, our challenge is to communicate that more effectively to constituents. This goes back to the point I was making earlier about preconceived attitudes towards regional investment in some quarters. Very often, when you hear conversations about freeway extensions or new train lines or new recreational facilities in metropolitan communities, it is all in the context of 'building infrastructure', as it should be. Yet, bizarrely, if you have that same conversation about building that new recreational facility or upgrading a significant road in a regional community, you start to hear terms like 'pork barrelling' and 'subsidy'—as though the capacity of such facilities to contribute to the economic activity is somehow diminished because they are further away from a capital city such as Perth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time that attitude changed, and I am pleased to say the Turnbull government is committed to doing just that. Sensible, strategic investment in regional communities could help fix the overcrowding of capital cities, such as Melbourne and Sydney and increasingly Perth. It is great to see the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash, in the chamber. Both those cities take around 100,000 extra people per year through immigration alone, and infrastructure simply cannot be built quickly enough to keep up. This results in congested roads, huge amounts of time spent getting to work or grocery shopping or taking kids to sport, more pollution and, overall, reduced quality of life. Although the problem is perhaps not yet as acute in my home town of Perth, anyone who has seen the freeways in peak hour over the last few years knows that our turn is just a matter of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building new roads or rail in capital cities costs multiples more than it does in the country because the city project involves buying and bulldozing houses, which costs a small fortune. Conversely, a new road in the country can often be built in a paddock or on crown or council land that costs a fraction of a new city freeway or highway. We should invest in our regions and make them so good that city people are proactively seeking opportunities to relocate. This requires investment by government in partnership with rural communities. Investment gives rural communities confidence to invest in their own futures and to make their own medium- to longer-term decisions. But, of course, regional investment cannot simply be a discussion about investment in infrastructure; increasingly, it is going to require a conversation about investing in people and, importantly, their skills. That is why the Turnbull government's commitment to innovation is so crucial to regional communities around Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased late last year to join many in Geraldton at what is called the 'West Tech Fest', one of WA's most significant regional centres and innovation projects. We need to stop thinking about innovation as being an inner-city buzzword and start to think more broadly about how the application of new technologies and ideas will help us to strengthen and diversify our regional economies. I had the privilege of addressing the West Tech Fest in Perth the year before last; and it so happened that occasion coincided with the release of the Prime Minister's innovation statement. There was a lot of focus on some of the 'techie' elements of that announcement, which I suppose is inevitable. Yet, as its heart, the innovation agenda is really a job creation agenda, and that is especially true for Australia's regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although we may be talking about new technologies, they have a very real and practical application in traditional areas of economic activity, including in agriculture. Not only can technology help regional communities to bridge the tyranny of distance, but it also make it easier to partner with others—with research institutions, suppliers and even government departments so that new ways of doing business can be explored and refined. For me, one of the most exciting elements in the whole innovation package announced 12 months ago was the decision to direct a slice of government procurement spending, which is worth some $40 billion a year, to purchasing from small business and start-ups, including those based in our regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government has to lead by example in this area, and this is one way it can support young people in regional communities who are taking a chance and backing their own ideas and putting their own money and energy where their mouth is. Now, of course, nothing happens as quickly as we might like, and that is true in government just as it is elsewhere. As part of the government's commitment to innovation, I think it is important that we look at opportunities to do more of this type of thing. It not only provides a more diverse economic foundation for regional communities but also brings new residents in a way that enriches local community life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  The date 1 February, just gone, marked Medicare's 33rd birthday. It is 33 years since the introduction of Medicare by the government of Bob Hawke. It is 33 years of universal health care—a Labor initiative which has ensured that access to health care for all Australians is determined by an individual's Medicare card, not their ability to pay or their credit card. It is 33 years of peace of mind for Australians in the event that their loved ones—their children or their parents—need medical care that is affordable and accessible. Thirty-three years on, Labor again finds itself fighting to save Medicare from a Liberal government that sought to dismantle it from day one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that when Gough Whitlam first introduced universal health care in the form of Medibank, back in 1974, Billy Snedden, then leader of the Liberal Party, said of that landmark: 'We will fight this scheme continuously and in the end we will defeat it.' It was later to be dismantled by Malcolm Fraser. Now 33 years old, Medicare had not seen such a concerted attack until recent times, with the advent of the Abbott government. On 1 February this year, the fight was taken up by Labor with the establishment of a Medicare task force inquiry. The first in a series of these public hearings to be held around the country was convened in Wyong, in the seat of Dobell on the Central Coast. The committee was chaired by Sharon Claydon, and included the deputy chair, Dr Mike Freelander, and the member for Dobell, Emma McBride. The committee heard from local patients, GPs, allied health professionals and local service providers. They were telling the truth to all who would hear them—which is certainly not this government—about their experiences under the new regime imposed on the sector by a Liberal-National federal coalition government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are many key areas where this coalition government has put Medicare and the health system in general under duress, the most burgeoning concern at the moment is the freeze on the Medicare rebate for GPs. Remember: that freeze came in after the Abbott government had its cruel plan for a $7 GP tax—an up-front charge for every visit to every doctor, for every scan and for every blood count—loudly and convincingly shouted down by the people. So then they brought in that tax by stealth, freezing the GP rebate for five years while simultaneously allowing doctors to charge more, taking the limitation off gap payments. What the freeze on rebates has done is make the business model for GPs unworkable. We have had many examples of this. Some of the evidence regarding skin cancer and the change in the way funding is provided based on the larger the size of your skin cancer the more funding the doctor gets back is delaying early access to doctors. There is a general trend in delaying treatment. This has been backed up by the evidence secured by the Medicare task force in the hearing at Wyong, which was told that the latest data from the local Primary Health Network revealed that 15,000 people from a population of 323,000 across the Central Coast have delayed seeing their GP because of this government's policy. In some circumstances, patients are paying up to $70, some even $100, to see their GP. Often these are people on pensions, on concession cards, who are having to make decisions about whether or not they can afford to see their GP. Local Liberal members like Lucy Wicks and others across the country deny the evidence that the task force is receiving. In fact, they deny their own figures. We actually have evidence from the government. If they do not want to listen to the people then they should at least listen to the facts, but it seems that they prefer to continue to recite the 'alternative' facts, otherwise known as 'lies', about diminishing access to health care that is a critical part of Australians' general inheritance under Labor. In out-of-pocket expenses, we know that there has been an increase of 4.67 per cent across the country and an increase of 4.92 per cent in New South Wales. People on the other side can say all they like about bulk-billing rates being up, but the reality is absolutely to the contrary. GPs and members of the public are telling us that they are sick and tired of the terrible impact of the freeze. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen from the government is an attempt to cut down the government contribution to Medicare. Always remember: we already pay a Medicare levy. This is a government that wants to slug you twice for a service. The day before the election, Mr Turnbull pulled $1.7 million out of his pocket to give to the Liberal Party. Here in this parliament he is asking Australians to pull more and more money out of their own pockets to access basic health services. Samantha Armytage asked Malcolm Turnbull: 'Can you guarantee our viewers will pay no more to see the doctor due to this freeze?' He said: 'Sam, absolutely.' His guarantee is not worth a jot. Under Abbott and Turnbull, Australians have to pay and will continue to pay more until Malcolm scraps his unfair health policies. </span>

It highlighted for me the glory and sanctity of marriage in Australia. I now realise why the government does not want to support gay and lesbian couples getting married. It is not, as many think, because the Prime Minister is too spineless to stand up to right-wing fringe dwellers; it is because it would be an insult to the precious, divine and blessed institution that is a civil marriage in Australia and its potential for weekend television ratings. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The year 2017 is an exciting one for the show. There is an expanded 90-minute format and major brands, including KFC, Suzuki and Lottoland, have announced that they are program partners. How can we possibly consider devaluing their investment and the marriages of people who have just met each other on reality TV by letting same-sex couples who have known and loved each other for years have these same rights to marry—same-sex couples, alas, who may have even raised children together; same sex couples who would destroy the institution of marriage now that it has finally become such a commercial success. And haven't these stars suffered enough? How can we let down last night's Lauren and Andrew? They both signed a television contract in good faith, believing gay and lesbians were not allowed to get married, so that they, after knowing each other for 15 seconds, could tie the knot in front of an altar. The institution of marriage needs to be protected so that people know that Deb and John are able to get married, despite the fact that she goes on about gluten far too much, he is not Polynesian and they have just met. We have to protect marriage from these people.</span>

In fact, the amount of money that you have quoted, listed in your speech, is the half of the total amount of the cut that was used to provide this report, to put that in context, Senator. This is bureaucratic report, a very important report for bureaucrats about what box was ticked and what box was not ticked. One of the most important omissions in this report, which we will be talking about in the months to come, is the omission of how we actually judge the outcomes on the ground. This is about how the bureaucracy behaved. What is really important to me is what actually happens to the people on the ground and how we make that assessment. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The ANAO only deals with the bureaucratic process of selecting the programs and ensuring that those programs are on the ground. It makes very little commentary or evaluation of the success or otherwise of the programs on the ground. This is a historical document. Since then, Senator, you would know we have already released revised guidelines, we have given a stronger role to the regional staff in the network and we have established a strengthened Assessment Management Office. We have accepted those recommendations of the ANAO report, and they have all, by and large, already been adopted, because it was historical. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

When the ANAO made their recommendation, they said: 'Well, you weren't given the right information. You didn't get enough information, Minister, as you said last night.' They did not take into consideration the other information we had in making these decisions. That information came from communities, came from the people receiving the services, came from the organisations that represented those communities. If the ANAO had come and seen me and said, 'What were the other issues you had to actually make those determinations?' we would have said, 'Because of the change in our approach of working with communities instead of doing something to communities.' So yes, this is a fundamental change about how governments have done things for decades and decades. I can assure you this is the best way to do things with communities, by ensuring that they have a bigger input into this process than the administrative processes of Canberra.</span>

                  </a>  These reforms will make childcare services and early education services more accessible, more affordable and better managed, and provide a far better foundation for the future in that regard. They are estimated to encourage around 230,000 Australian families to be able to work more, to engage in the workforce. Just this morning, as the Prime Minister, Minister Porter and I, with Senator Seselja, visited a local childcare service, chatting to the parents there they demonstrated to us and said to us that these are the types of changes that will make it easier to decide to return to work. They will make it simpler to determine the number of hours in which they work. Those changes will occur because, of course, for the vast majority of parents we will be removing the child care rebate cap and they will no longer fall off that cliff part-way through the year, but instead will be able to have continuous year-round support to access quality early-learning and childcare services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, our new hourly rate caps will put downward pressure on future price increases, providing more certainty and stability for taxpayers and parents in the future. Importantly, we are improving and increasing the level of subsidy for the lowest-income Australians. In the future, low-income Australian families will see the level of subsidy grow from around 72 per cent to around 85 per cent. This package of reforms is coupled with a $1 billion safety net to make sure that children in the most vulnerable circumstances are still guaranteed access to at least two sessions of care and early learning a week, to make sure they get those developmental opportunities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time"> (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:08):</span>   Let me give a couple of examples. Indeed, these reforms are of course fully funded and fully paid for through other savings measures the government is implementing. So I will consider these in totality. Let's take a single parent earning around $50,000 per annum and with two children under six in long day care three days a week. The net impact of family tax benefit changes and childcare changes for that parent will be a benefit of $2,470 a year. This is a real benefit for those parents. Equally, a family of two parents on $80,000 a year and with two children under six in long day care for three days a week will benefit in net terms by almost $3,000. That is because there is far better targeting in our reforms. These are progressive reforms that better-target taxpayer support to the families who most need it, to the most hardworking, lowest-earning Australians. They are the type of reforms the Labor Party would once have embraced and been proud of themselves. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That was a simple suggestion that they would increase the existing child care rebate cap. In doing so they were going to provide windfall gains of $176 million to families earning more than $250,000. That is hardly a progressive approach. That is hardly effective targeting of taxpayer dollars. Our approach, our policy, is about ensuring that the most hard-working, lowest-earning Australians get the greatest support. Our reforms will ensure those families can access quality early-learning services for around $15 a day. But they make sure that we target the dollars where they best need to be targeted.</span>

Comparable remote areas in Queensland and Western Australia do not have access to ABC shortwave services.

As colleagues would be aware the ABC has legislative independence—independence that this parliament has given them—in relation to operational matters. I should also point out that the ABC's decision is in no way related to government funding. The ABC's base funding was confirmed in the last budget for the next three years.</span>

Also, the ABC did give a limited period of notice. These are views that I have conveyed to the ABC and I think the ABC has learnt some valuable lessons when it comes to consultation and engagement with rural and regional Australia. I am also pleased that the ABC has now announced that there will be some transitional arrangements to assist people in the Northern Territory who may have been in receipt of shortwave transmissions to use other mechanisms to connect with the ABC as an organisation. I will share some of those in the answer to the next question.</span>

That agreement with the Obama administration, which was the subject of much talk last week after the telephone conversation between Prime Minister Turnbull and President Trump, has been affirmed by President Trump, the Secretary of State and by President Trump's spokesman. So that is what the Australian government is doing to clean up another Labor mess.</span>

Through you, Mr President, I am very pleased to advise colleagues that today four million Australian homes and businesses can now access the NBN. That is four million and 46 thousand to be exact, or one-third of the nation. That is one million additional homes and businesses in just six months. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the far north of Queensland to Bunbury in WA, the NBN is being switched on at almost 30,000 workplaces and homes each and every week. With this scaling up, the NBN is on track to be available to half of Australian homes and businesses by the middle of the year. And the great news is that the benefits of the NBN are now being felt around the nation. As you would know, Mr President, distance education students can now see their classmates by video; regional wineries can operate their head offices from the cellar door; and families can get their bills paid, homework completed and shopping done all at the same time. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be easy to forget, if I did not remind colleagues, that things were not always like this. Between 2010 and 2013 there were only 51,000 premises connected to the NBN. That is not 51,000 in one electorate or one state; that is 51,000 premises in the entire nation. So we have made dramatic progress since the change in 2013. And the NBN will be finished six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under those opposite. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Just as when it comes to energy we are technology agnostic, when it comes to the NBN we are also technology agnostic. I have said to colleagues before that former Senator Conroy had what I would characterise as a theological approach to the rollout of the NBN. We are taking a technology approach. The great news is, because we use the technology that makes sense in a given area, because our mandate regarding the NBN is to roll it out as soon as possible and at lowest cost, the NBN will be completed, is on track to be completed, and is on budget to be completed by 2020. That is six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under those opposite and at $30 billion less cost—finished sooner, at less cost, on time, on budget. </span>

I can assist, Senator Bushby, in how consumers and taxpayers will benefit through the coalition's approach. It is quite straightforward: if the project costs less, taxpayers will pay less for it. If the project costs less, the people who access voice and data over the NBN will pay less in what they are required to render to the NBN through their retail service providers. That is what we are about: seeing the NBN built as soon as it possibly can be, because that is when you get the full national economic benefits. You do not get that until you have all Australian homes and businesses able to access the NBN. If we had continued with the approach of those opposite, there would be many Australians who were waiting until 2026 or 2028. Can you imagine that, Mr President?—Australians having to wait until 2026 or 2028? We said, 'No way. We're going to do better. All done, all dusted, by 2020.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:27</span>):  My question is to Senator Nash, the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Every year dozens of young Australians die or are permanently disabled from meningococcal disease. The Bexsero vaccine against the major strain, meningococcal B, is available privately but the government refuses to list it on the national immunisation program, following advice from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Given the UK and Ireland now offer the vaccine as part of a routine childhood immunisation and the US offers it for free to poorer families, why should not Australia follow suit and offer the vaccine for free through the national immunisation program?</span>

The federal government takes the cases of meningococcal very seriously. The nation's chief medical officer is monitoring this situation very closely. We are of course well aware that there are parents who are concerned about this, but I do note that the cases of meningococcal B have declined by about 60 per cent over the last 10 years. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, many in the chamber know that this is a matter for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The government takes the advice of the PBAC very seriously. They are the independent experts. My advice is that this particular vaccine has been before the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, I think, three times, and each time it was determined by the PBAC that it was not deemed effective enough to be listed. However, having said that, the company is of course able to offer further information if they believe that that further information would provide more evidence of the efficacy of the vaccine. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly take the PBAC's recommendations very closely and very seriously, which is evidenced by around $4.9 billion worth of extra investment in the listing of medicines from the PBAC. These are the experts, the independent experts that have that knowledge and, indeed, the expertise to advise government, and it is incumbent on the government to accept that advice and ensure that we make the best decisions for the health of people right across the nation.</span>

I love getting questions from Senator O'Sullivan because he is positive about the potential of our resources industry to drive economic growth in our country and create jobs. He knows it well in the area that he is from in Western Queensland, and it is also important in my part of the world in Central Queensland as well. He is right to point out that it is a happy moment for this country that we have recorded a record trade surplus on Friday just gone. In the latest statistics we now have a trade surplus of almost $6 billion—$5.8 billion. It has increased by $5.3 billion. It is a record amount. It is the highest amount on record in this nation. $3.2 billion of that $5.3 billion increase was down to an increase in mining and resources exports. So it was something that was driven by the resources sector in some sense. For the mining sector it was also a record amount of mining exports in December 2016 of $16 billion. That is a happy outcome for our nation, too. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the idea that the mining boom is over or finished is wrong. People who make that claim are dead wrong. The mining boom has not finished, because we are exporting record amounts of mining commodities in history. We have never exported as much iron ore and coal as we are at the moment. Thankfully for us, in the last six months the prices have also been at elevated levels. Those prices may not be maintained at those levels we have seen, and some have certainly come off in the last few months, but we will continue to export near record amounts over the next few years because our sector is very strong and very competitive. It has some of the most efficient coal and iron ore mines and other mines in the world. That is a good outcome for our nation and for the thousands of people who rely on the industry for their jobs.</span>

We are exporting record amounts of iron ore and coal, which is a great outcome for our nation. It is a great outcome for the environment too, because we have some of the highest quality coal in the world. In terms of carbon emissions it is better for the world that the world uses our coal and not some other coal in other countries which is not of such high quality. We have had record growth in our exports to China; even the European Union is increasing as a share of our resource exports. What is really important for our nation is that India and other Asian countries are coming onto the map. India is now our biggest destination for metallurgical coal. These parts of the world have strong growth prospects, so it is good for our mining sector.</span>

He is absolutely right about the government's intent and objective to attract more investment in our resources sector. Obviously the strong outcomes of the sector are helping in that regard, but we are also being proactive and making sure that we facilitate investment coming into this country. That is why we have established the one-stop shop for environmental approvals, a change that we believe will save upwards of nearly $400 million a year in regulatory costs. That will help bring investment to our country, investments like the Amrun project, which was formerly known as the South of Embley project, in Cape York. Senator O'Sullivan would know that full well. That has finally been approved, and it is a great thing for the people of Cape York. It is an area that needs jobs and investment. It has a strong and proud Indigenous community, and they are very proud that that project now takes the name of a local language dialect, Amrun. That is a project of more than $2 billion that is going to drive growth in Cape York. It is another great outcome that our resource industries are delivering for Australia.</span>

In 2009, you referred to the 'socialism we had to have' under Gough Whitlam, who thought he could 'spend his way out of trouble' and 'went to great lengths to borrow more and more money'. I agree. After three years, Whitlam left Australia with a deficit of $1½ billion, government spending at 24 per cent of GDP and tax receipts at 20 per cent. Your government, after three years, has left Australia with a deficit of $37 billion, government spending at 25 per cent of GDP and tax receipts at 22 per cent. Whitlam left no debt. Net debt is now $317 billion. Are you more socialist than Whitlam?</span>

The short answer to that question is, of course, 'no'. I refer Senator Leyonhjelm and the Senate to the most recent Budget Paper No. 1 and the very helpful time series on page 10-5 and 10-6 which starts in the year of my birth, 1970, and covers 50 years all the way to 2020. What you will see is that before Gough Whitlam got into government spending as a share of GDP was 19 per cent, and it increased by a massive five per cent as a share of GDP in three short years. In fact, in the last few years of the three-year term of the Gough Whitlam government spending increased above inflation by 19.9 per cent and by 15.7 per cent, respectively. That is unprecedented in that 50-year period that is published in this budget paper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only other double-digit increase in spending above inflation that we have experienced in that whole time happened under—you guessed it: the first budget of the Rudd Labor government in 2008-09 when spending increased by 12.7 per cent above inflation and 17 per cent over two years. It took spending back to 25 per cent of the share of GDP. Not to be outdone, the Gillard government locked in further spending increases in legislation. But they were more sneaky; they did it outside the published forward estimates, so it was not obvious in the forward estimates documents. So, when we came into government, spending as a share of GDP was on track to 26.5 per cent by 2023-24 and, indeed, in excess of 30 per cent, according to the intergenerational report, over time. We have brought that back down to 25 per cent. We have got spending growth under control. That has involved some difficult decisions. But, of course, we know that the Labor Party in the lead-up to the last election promised spending that would have worsened the deficit by $16.5 billion.</span>

In the year Rudd left office tax receipts were 21 per cent of GDP and net debt was $202 billion. Tax receipts and net debt are now higher under your government, and you project this will remain the case in the future. Doesn't this make you more Whitlam-esque than Rudd?</span>

The truth of the matter is that around 75 per cent of total Australian government expenditure is made through special appropriations under distinct legislation, not through the annual appropriation bills. That is, of course, a mechanism that the Gillard government used to tie up Australia in massively unfunded and unaffordable spending growth in the years well beyond the termination of her government for Australia.</span>

We have had a $155 million Growth Fund, of which $100 million has come from the federal government. There have been contributions from the state governments and from the car companies. We are going to continue intensive employment assistance. That will be available to workers all the way through to 2018. With the Victorian government and with the South Australia government, we are looking at: community-based initiatives that make sure that workers who are transitioning are, as far as possible, being given the opportunity to find jobs in their local communities; and how to strengthen the bases of those local communities.</span>

There is a lot going on. There is a lot more that can be done through existing programs, and, where we need to, we can provide additional resources—for example, in the employment services space—to fund priority projects. We are doing all of that; we are standing by the workers in those industries and we are promoting high-end research skills.

What we will also do in the period ahead, as I said, is make sure that intensive employment assistance is available to workers going forward. This is on top of the money that the companies themselves are providing, and rightly should provide, because they have a responsibility to those workers. They have made the decision to go and they have a responsibility to those workers. Toyota and Holden have provided money and Ford has been providing money, and we will ensure that that money is appropriately used as part of a framework to promote local employment.</span>

Since the 1960s, 13,000 Australians have volunteered their time, their energy, their expertise and their passion in about 42 developing nations in our region and beyond. The Turnbull government recognises the vital role that Australian volunteers play today and have played over many years, not just in our region but beyond. In 2015-16, 1,345 Australians gave their time, their energy and their expertise in 29 different countries, not just in the Indo-Pacific but right across the world. That is helping governments in civil society, in education, in health and in a whole range of different areas to contribute to the economic growth of those countries, in turn to contribute to the prosperity of those countries and, of course, to contribute to the prosperity and security of our region.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everywhere I go, I have the opportunity, and indeed the privilege, to meet many of our volunteers. What is really interesting is that they come from all different ages—some are young and some are retired—and they do all sorts of different things. Their expertise is in a whole range of different areas. It could be, for example, lending support to the legal system or helping, particularly in the Pacific, in the prosthesis area, there being a massive problem with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These volunteers are the public face of Australia. They are ambassadors for Australia and they are doing an absolutely marvellous job. As I said, they range from speech pathologists right through to those in different industries, but they are all making a wonderful contribution.</span>

Basically, our volunteers are helping countries to help themselves. Many are embedded in key positions in countries, both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, and they do different jobs. Often, they may go to a country to do a particular job but end up doing not just that job but a whole lot more. They become very integrated within the society. Often that is a very good measure of how Australia's contribution is having an effect at the grassroots of their responsibilities. Their assignments are often set out in our aid investment plans, and they are targeted and address particular needs that those countries have, particularly in relation to increasing their economic growth. For example, in 2015-16, 15 per cent of assignments were in the disability sector. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Every volunteer is at the forefront of building not only the capacity of those countries but also greater understanding, tolerance, peace and harmony in our region. Stability in our region is paramount. A strong, stable and prosperous Australia needs a strong, stable and prosperous Pacific; therefore, utilising our volunteers in key positions means that they are adding not just to the long-term prosperity of the country where they are working but also to the stability and security of our region. They help to deliver skills to our neighbours, they build links and friendships, and I pay tribute to them for the hard work that they do.</span>

The latest labour force data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that since the Abbott-Turnbull government was elected the unemployment rate in Western Australia has increased by two percentage points, to 6.6 per cent, with an additional 30,400 people without work. Minister, is this an example of the buoyant labour market that you described yesterday?</span>

                  </a>  So, Senator Sterle, Western Australian jobs are part of the national jobs figures. The point I made yesterday and the point I would make to you again is that the rate of job creation under this government in 2016 is slightly more than four times greater than the rate of job creation under the last year of the Labor government. Rather than take it from me, Senator Sterle, perhaps you may have seen this morning, reported in the financial press, the monetary policy statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Philip Lowe. This is what Dr Philip Lowe, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, had to say about labour market conditions:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Labour market indicators continue to be mixed and there is considerable variation in employment outcomes across the country. The unemployment rate has moved a little higher recently, but growth in full-time employment turned positive late in 2016. The forward-looking indicators point to continued expansion in employment over the period ahead.</span>
              </p>

Senator Sterle, I mentioned specific measures that are beneficial to Western Australia. Let me go on: the Perth Freight Link. The Commonwealth government has committed $1.2 billion of the $1.9 billion cost of the Perth Freight Link. The construction phase of that project will create 2,400 direct jobs and an expected 10,000 indirect jobs. Then we turn to NorthLink Western Australia. The Tonkin Highway grade separations and the Swan Valley bypass projects, known as NorthLink WA, have attracted a Commonwealth government commitment of $894.3 million. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Like many in the chamber here today, I was humbled this morning to attend the annual Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month breakfast, and in particular to meet with and listen to an incredibly inspirational woman by the name of Trudy Crawley. She is someone who is living with terminal ovarian cancer. She came along today to share her story with us and to just remind us why it is so important that, regardless of which political party is in office, governments across Australia should support, in particular, research into ovarian cancer. As we know, it is one of the most commonly diagnosed gynaecological cancers in Australia, and more than 1,300 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year. If you look around the chamber, that equates to four women each day. Unfortunately though it also has the lowest survival rate of all of the gynaecological cancers in Australia. That is why the work that Ovarian Cancer Australia does to raise awareness of this particular disease is just so important. In terms of the work they are doing, the 25/25 vision, which aims to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer by 25 per cent as well as improve five-year relative survival rates by 25 per cent by 2025, brings a focus to this ambitious goal. The Know. Ask. Act. campaign continues to raise awareness of symptoms, when to seek help and how to raise important funds for Ovarian Cancer Australia. Again, on behalf of everybody in the chamber, I congratulate Ovarian Cancer Australia for the important work they do in continuing to raise awareness in relation to this cancer. </span>

Olaparib previously—and, if you have had ovarian cancer, you would know this—cost a patient more than $104,000 per course of treatment. As many of us in this chamber would personally know, you just find the money and you pay it if that is what you have to do. But now, with subsidised access through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, it is available for just $6.30 for concessional patients and $38.80 for general patients. It is estimated that on average 237 patients per year over six years will benefit from this listing but, in particular, it can improve quality of life and significantly extent life expectancy for these women. </span>

Of the approximately $2 billion we have invested in all cancers since 2000 through the National Health and Medical Research Council and Cancer Australia, more than $100 million was directed to ovarian cancer research. Alongside Cancer Australia, we are working hard to have the most effective campaigns, raising awareness amongst medical professionals and conducting the research that will improve the direction and outcomes. An initiative we support, which is particularly close to many of us in this chamber, is of course the Jeannie Ferris Cancer Australia Recognition Award in honour of our colleague who lost her battle with ovarian cancer in 2007. She did all that she could in her time to raise awareness of this cancer, and it is incumbent upon us all to continue her legacy. </span>

The five per cent he referred to was a five per cent cut over the programs in order to sustain them in the shemozzle that was going on in the implementation.

His answers did not articulate to me a way forward beyond the current policy settings that have led to the problems that the audit office has shone light upon. The minister has focused his grand hopes for a new world order on a proposed multi-year program of evidence and evaluation activities in a contracted program at outcomes level. This new program will take, as I am informed, $10 million a year from the IAS—the Indigenous Advancement Strategy—over five years to evaluate the program. I am informed this is not new money. This is money that has been taken from addressing the issues on the ground and diverted, probably to the consultancy industry, to do the evaluations. It is patching up some of the failings by the minister's department in failing to have appropriate evaluation processes in place in the first instance. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and their organisations have many answers as to what works, and they have a collective resource of knowledge as to why it works. That comes through again and again in the views expressed by the informed academics, by community organisations and by the people whose lives are grounded in the reality in which they live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer is to engage the community and their organisations on the grounds of a genuine partnership. This is the rhetoric of the IAS, the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, coming out of the department, and I have heard it. In your answer, it is not the reality. It is not the lived reality of our people, who have suffered through the IAS fiasco. It is not the case today, and it was not the case in the period of the audit review. I agree wholeheartedly with the minister that it is important for the government and the taxpayers but more important for the communities in whose name the money is being spent. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144138" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate. No government, and no side of politics, can claim to have found policy nirvana in the area of Indigenous affairs as long as Indigenous Australians continue to experience a life which is nowhere near in line with that of their fellow Australians. There is work that we all need to do to get closer to better policy outcomes for Indigenous Australians, but this government is making a real effort to get closer to that situation, and I commend the minister's efforts, including through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, to make those gains and those improvements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous Advancement Strategy has greatly improved the transparency and accountability of Indigenous affairs funding. As a result of the coalition government's IAS reforms, we now know, for the first time, how much money is being spent across the Indigenous Affairs portfolio and what outcomes we can expect for the investment of taxpayers' money. That sounds like an extraordinary thing to say in 2017—that it is only now that we know how much money is being spent on Indigenous advancement—but that is an important reform achieved by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The IAS introduced reforms that were long overdue and essential to ensure that our investment in Indigenous affairs was getting to where it would be the most effective. Importantly, frontline service delivery was maintained and outcomes were improved through the introduction of the IAS. Through the 2014 grant funding round, the percentage of Indigenous organisations funded increased from 30 per cent to 45 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I said, we can always do better. That is why—and I think this is very crucial—the government plans to allocate $10 million a year over the next four years to strengthen the evaluation of the IAS programs. That is one of the key pieces of feedback we have had in recent years, and I note particularly the excellent work done by Sara Hudson at the Centre for Independent Studies and the importance that she and other scholars in this area place on the evaluation of the effectiveness of programs, because we need to ensure that money being spent in this area is actually improving the lives of Indigenous Australians. This evaluation will ensure that we know what works and, importantly, why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The IAS has three key priorities. The first is getting children to school, the second is getting adults to work, and the third is making communities safer. These are three objectives that I am sure all senators share. The IAS is focused on these priorities because that is what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have said they want the government to deliver. We have listened, we are learning, and that is the feedback we have received. These are fundamental to improving the outcomes for First Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already the Indigenous Advancement Strategy is making a difference. Around 60 First Australians are being placed into jobs every single day. The Remote School Attendance Strategy is helping approximately 14,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children get to school. Through our Indigenous Procurement Policy, millions of dollars in Commonwealth contracts are going to Indigenous businesses every year. This is a really important strategy to help encourage Indigenous entrepreneurship and allow them to start businesses that will help lift them out of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's IAS brought together 150 programs and activities into five broad streams. It consolidated some of the 1,800 staff from across eight different departments and agencies into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and created a regional network which is now working in partnership with Indigenous communities across urban, regional and remote Australia. These reforms have enabled a far more strategic and flexible approach to the government's investment in Indigenous affairs to achieve better outcomes on the ground while also relieving the administrative burden and red tape from organisations servicing Indigenous communities. The IAS has delivered on this government's commitment to doing things with Indigenous Australians, including by increasing the percentage of Indigenous organisations funded, as I said earlier, from 30 per cent to 45 per cent under the grant funding round.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning of my contribution to this discussion, no government can claim to have found the perfect solution to any of the problems that the Indigenous community faces, but this government is making a very good effort to get closer to that situation, and we are seeing very real gains from this government's Indigenous affairs policies. I hope to see that continue over the coming years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  The responses to my questions to Senator Fifield as Minister for Communications in relation to the ABC's removal of its short-wave radio services across northern Australia and indeed the Pacific confirm what a total disaster and disgrace this decision has been. The minister admits that consultation has been totally inadequate. The next question is: what are you going to do about it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The removal of short-wave services to the people of the remote regions of northern Australia is a life-and-death issue. It matters. It matters to the people on the ground, from our communities, our cattle stations and along the coastlines to our fishing communities and the truckies who travel the roads in those most remote regions. If ever there was a case that showed the huge city-country divide, this decision certainly wins the gold medal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of short-wave radio, in the responses by the minister, he said the ABC made this decision and that it is in no way related to funding—that the ABC has base funding confirmed for the next three years. However, in the discussions I, along with our shadow communications minister, Mark Dreyfus, had with the managing director of the ABC, Michelle Guthrie, she said that it was related to funding and that, as a result of contractual relationships and discussions with Broadcast Australia, this was a decision the ABC had to make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Senate that the decision to remove a very vital service to the people of northern Australia and giving only seven weeks notice—in the first week of December, going into Christmas and New Year, when people could not give their full attention to responding urgently to this issue in an adequate way—that on 31 January this service would be turned off is totally appalling. Having the Minister for Communications confirm that the consultation which the ABC says it took was not adequate means that there must be movement now to look into this and to reinstate the service to the people of northern Australia and all those in the Pacific who rely on this very critical service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge also the work of my colleagues Warren Snowdon MP, Luke Gosling MP, Mark Dreyfus MP, Stephen Jones MP and even the Leader of the Opposition in writing to the Prime Minister, urging him to act, saying that we need this service. We are not there yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Minister Fifield said in his response that the ABC has relented slightly by donating certain equipment. Well, hello, that equipment will not work. We do not have the technology in the Northern Territory, compared to our brothers and sisters in the cities of Australia. We want to have that technology, but we are not there yet. We rely solely on the short-wave radio service beyond so many kilometres of the main cities of Darwin and Alice Springs. This is a completely disastrous decision. The VAST services which the ABC says is what the digital move is towards will not work for us—not yet. We want to be there, but we are not there yet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best thing that this government can do is provide the moneys necessary to get short-wave radio back up and running in northern Australia and in the Pacific so that these people in remote and regional parts of Australia do not lose the communication that they so very much deserve.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I am grateful also for the opportunity to speak on the matters that have been brought to the attention of the Senate through the questions from senators McCarthy and Dodson. I appreciate the perspective they bring, coming from the communities they do, having spent a bit of time with those communities myself, particularly in the Northern Territory last year, and seeing firsthand some of the issues they face in that region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I start with the answers from the Minister for Communications that Senator McCarthy was referring to. It is an interesting juxtaposition, I suppose you could say, with regard to what this question was getting at. On the one hand, the opposition demand the independence of the ABC, which the minister referred to in his answer—that the ABC has legislated independence—but, on the other hand, they demand that there be an intervention. I accept that there are concerns and issues around what is taking place with the cessation of the short-wave service. But you cannot have it both ways. The ABC Board, as the minister said, had gone through the process they needed to go through and had made a decision. In view of the reference to the ageing technology of the short-wave service and the cost of maintaining it, is it the best deal that the Northern Territory community can get? That is a question that I think remains unanswered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addressing this, I just wonder whether it is the ALP's plan to take back control of operational decisions made by the ABC Board. Is Senator McCarthy, in asking that question, insisting that Senator Fifield intervene; and, if so, is that what the Labor Party would do if they were returned to the treasury bench? On the point about budgetary constraints made by Senator McCarthy, Senator McCarthy said she spoke to the managing director of the ABC and claims that Ms Guthrie made claims that it was related to budget cuts, and I will be very interested in exploring that exact issue with her at Senate estimates in a couple of weeks time. But the minister said that this matter was not related to that. It is always interesting to hear what people have to say about these things, and, as I said, I will be interested to hear what Ms Guthrie has to say about it when we get the chance to speak to her about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Communications did outline the transitional arrangements that the ABC is assisting with, including the provision of VAST satellite services to a number of organisations, including all Royal Flying Doctor Service bases, which I think is a vital and important part of making sure that communications still operate. The RFDS provide an incredibly important service right throughout that community affected. Also for all of the four-wheel drive radio clubs in the affected region, which will allow the rebroadcast of emergency or warning messages, which I think is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister did stress that this was not a decision taken lightly by the ABC. Indeed, he also expressed his views about the community reaction around the consultation process, so I think that must be taken into account. But, going back to the original point, we also need to take into account the independence of the ABC board and how they make their decisions. So I believe it is not entirely fair to come in here and say: 'Fix it! Go and fix it!' when there are legislated mechanisms around how the ABC make these decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Turning briefly to the answers that Senator Dodson made a contribution on a little bit earlier, I think I can only reinforce the points made by Senator Paterson. The key one is around the Indigenous Advancement Strategy and the point that when we have knowledge about services being provided and the funds being provided it allows us to understand properly where we need to go from the current point in time. I think the point was made by Senator Paterson and indeed by the minister that there is always room for improvement, which I think is a very mature acknowledgement for any government minister or any senator to make. I think it is the right one. I do not think there is anyone sitting here saying, 'Yep, it's absolutely perfect.' I think Senator Paterson referred to it as policy nirvana with regard to this particular portfolio. It is important to note that this is about giving us that knowledge so that we know from here where to go. There is work to be done. I just think that we need to get some reason into our debates in this place and not demand what we cannot have. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="231199" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I also rise to take note of the answers provided to Senators McCarthy and Dodson by Senators Fifield and Scullion on the cessation of ABC's short-wave radio and the poor management of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy grants. What these senators on my left were asking were simple questions—which I think could have been given very clear answers, but were not—on critical services that apply to rural and regional Australia and also to Indigenous Australians. They were very simple questions and they both were at the heart of clear problems with the Abbott-Turnbull government's cuts to vital services and lack of consultation. We see that very clearly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cessation of the short-wave radio service is yet another example of Prime Minister Turnbull's confusion over innovation and reality. The ABC and the government have displayed a complete lack of understanding of the services in communications that are available to people in remote outback Australia. People have been told that they should subscribe to the new viewer access satellite TV, satellite phones and internet services. But this advice completely misses the point that these services are scratchy at best and are not available to people on the move. As Minister Scullion surely knows and as I would hope Minister Fifield knows, it can take many hours to travel from one end of one property to another, and if the weather is inclement satellite services may not even work across that journey. It is as though the ministers expect the people of remote Northern Territory to travel the countryside in a massive bus akin to the one in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</span>, with a huge, outrageous satellite on the top. It is not the reality of what we would expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the campaigning of Senator McCarthy and our colleagues in the lower house, Mr Gosling and Mr Snowdon, the government was forced to at least make a comment on this issue. But late in the peace, just a few weeks before the short-wave service was to be cut, Minister Scullion made a late attempt to save face with his constituents in the outback. But his worth in cabinet must be questioned because all his colleague Minister Fifield can do is blame the ABC for a decision that this government made to cut that back. Both ministers have a very shorty memory about their budget cuts to the ABC, but they are trying to hide the fact that under their watch $254 million have been cut from the ABC's budget. Now all they can say about these services is, 'It's the ABC's decision.' Of course the ABC has to make decisions around budget cuts when the cuts are coming from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to note that this cut to short-wave services—as I think Senator McCarthy made reference to—does not just affect Australians. Millions of people in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and right across the breadth of the South Pacific rely also on short-wave radio for information on natural disasters—this is an area which we know has a number of these—and news about the world. At a time when China, New Zealand, the UK and Germany are expanding their short-wave services into the Pacific, the Turnbull government sleeps at the wheel and completely lacks any understanding of the availability of digital satellite technology in remote communities across the Pacific and across the top of Australia. Do the minister and the Prime Minister seriously believe that people in remote villages on Pacific islands have access to digital radios? Come on. It is a critical time for Australia and the Pacific, with the referendum in Bougainville coming up, with the withdrawal of RAMSI in the Solomon Islands and with the push by China and other people to increase their influence. And yet this government cuts off our direct line to the people. For what? A total saving for the ABC of $1.8 million. It is outrageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC and the government have claimed that another reason for ending the short-wave service is a lack of understanding about the number of listeners. And yet there is evidence from Papua New Guinea that over 20 per cent of that population listen to Radio Australia either on the day of that survey or the day before. Minister Fifield spent a lot of time blaming the ABC board for this decision. I think it is time that the ministers in this government stood up and represented the people in those communities and listened to the people in those communities about their needs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator McKim today relating to asylum seekers on Manus Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge my disappointment that Senator Brandis has chosen now to leave the chamber so that presumably he does not have to hear about the inadequacy of his answers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing we did get out of Senator Brandis today—and I found out today once again why they call it question time, not answer time—is that 60 people who reached out their hands in desperation to Australia and asked for asylum in our country and help from our country, people who have been indefinitely detained in Papua New Guinea as a result of reaching out that hand and asking for our help, some for many years indefinitely detained, are going to be forcibly deported from Papua New Guinea. These people, our fellow human beings, who have done no wrong and have committed no crime, have been indefinitely detained on Manus Island under conditions which amount to torture—most of them for many years. The idea that forcible deportation—people being handcuffed and frogmarched onto aeroplanes against their will and sent back to the countries that they have fled, in many cases in fear for their very lives and the lives of their families—is simply stomach-turning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as it tragically so often does for our fellow human beings indefinitely detained on either Manus Island or on Nauru, it gets worse for those people. Papua New Guinea provides for significant appeal rights, including for administrative determinations on matters like refugee status determinations. When I asked Senator Brandis today whether the government would oppose forcible deportations prior to detainees being given the chance to exhaust all of their legal opportunities in Papua New Guinea, we got nothing from the Attorney-General of Australia. The man who is the primary law officer in our country, who is tasked above all others in upholding the rule of law in Australia, would not go in to bat for the rule of law in Papua New Guinea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a reasonable Attorney and a reasonable person in this place would have done is get up here today and say, 'Of course people should have access to every potential legal remedy available to them under Papua New Guinea law, and the Australian government will do everything it can to make sure that is the case.' But that is not what we got form the Attorney. What we got from the Attorney was a non-response on that issue. It is simply disgraceful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indefinite detention under the conditions that exist on Manus Island and Nauru has been found, in the case of Nauru, by Amnesty International to be akin to torture and to meet the internationally accepted definition of torture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The harm that we are doing to our fellow human beings on Manus Island and Nauru is magnified many times by the uncertainty that they are facing—the lack of hope, the ebbing away of hope that has to a degree sustained them in the past. That indefinite detention coupled with, at times, horrific conditions in the camps on Manus Island and Nauru has set the preconditions for many of the tragic stories that we have heard from those camps, including self-harm and sexual assault, including sexual assault of children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the name of compassion and in the name of common human decency, it is time to close the camps and bring those people here to Australia so we can look after them, fulfil our moral and legal obligations to them and help them overcome— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span>.</span>

                <a href="e5v" type="OfficeSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  Senators, I wish to advise you about a matter of privilege that has been raised by Senator Waters. By letter dated 27 January this year, the Chair of the Environment and Communications References Committee, Senator Waters, has raised a matter of privilege concerning that committee's 2015 inquiry into fin-fish aquaculture in Tasmania.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In her letter, Senator Waters reports on the committee's consideration of a matter first raised with me by Senator Whish-Wilson in November last year. The catalyst was an ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program broadcast on 31 October 2016, which alleged that representatives of Tassal may have improperly interfered with the right of a witness to appear before the committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Matters of privilege must be raised and determined in accordance with the Senate privilege resolutions. These require me to determine, having regard to the criteria in privilege resolution No. 4 and only those criteria, whether a proposal to refer the matter to the privileges committee should have precedence in debate over other business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When the matter was first raised by Senator Whish-Wilson I was satisfied that it met the first criteria—that is, 'the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions'. The Senate has always regarded the protection of witnesses as one its highest duties, so any credible allegation that a witness has been improperly influenced in respect of their evidence is likely to satisfy this criterion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I consider that the second criterion—the existence of a remedy other than the use of the contempt power—had not, at that stage, been satisfied. An alternative remedy was available, namely the investigation of the matter by the relevant committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I therefore wrote to Senator Whish-Wilson, on 7 November last year, indicating that I intended to bring the matter to the attention of the Environment and Communications References Committee, and I wrote to the chair, Senator Waters, on the same date asking the committee to make the necessary inquiries and to report to the Senate in accordance with Privilege Resolution 1(18), should the facts warrant it. Senator Waters' letter comprises a report on that investigation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the investigation was to enable the committee to determine whether the allegations had substance. Having taken the necessary steps, the committee has concluded that the witness may have been improperly influenced. The only remaining remedy to address those concerns is the use of the Senate's contempt powers. In that sense, the second of the criteria I am required to consider is satisfied.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of these criteria is to ensure that a matter which meets them is given an appropriate opportunity to be dealt with as an item of business, so that the Senate may then make a decision on the merits of the case. The decision by the President to grant precedence is not a recommendation that the matter should be referred to the Privileges Committee for inquiry, simply that the Senate should be given the earliest opportunity to make that decision for itself.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I therefore grant precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. I table the correspondence and now invite Senator Whish-Wilson to give notice of such a motion on behalf of Senator Waters.</span>

                  </a>  I will be as quick as I can. With regard to my intention to withdraw notices of motion proposing the disallowance of three instruments made under the Migration Act 1958, when these instruments were received by the parliament they had been incorrectly listed as being exempt from disallowance, and were thereby tabled as 'exempt from disallowance'. To ensure the effective oversight of the instruments by parliament, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances reported on the matter and, as a protective measure, gave notices of motion to disallow each of the instruments, thereby providing an additional 15 sitting days after the notices of motion were given to resolve the issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following correspondence with the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the committee concluded that the incorrect classification of these instruments was an isolated error and noted that the explanatory statements to the instruments correctly stated that the instruments were subject to disallowance. The committee's final report on this matter is contained in Delegated Legislation Monitor 8 of 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee remains concerned more generally about the classification process for instruments and the potential for administrative errors to hinder the effective oversight of instruments by parliament. In this respect there may be circumstances in which the committee considers that the incorrect classification of an instrument as exempt from disallowance may warrant its urgent remaking.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our fisheries management framework is internationally recognised as one of the best in the world.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth fisheries legislation primarily regulates the commercial harvest of fish stocks in Commonwealth fisheries to ensure catch rates and fish stocks are at sustainable levels. However in recent years there has been an increase in the amount of recreational fishing occurring in Commonwealth waters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As significant stakeholders in Commonwealth fisheries it is important that recreational fishers' interests can be readily identified and taken into consideration by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recreational fishers have an interest in a number of fish stocks managed by the Australian Government. Considering their interests as part of the fisheries management framework is important both for ensuring sustainable fish stocks and for optimising the benefits of our fisheries resources for the Australian community. Proposed amendments will address this, ensuring that legislation keeps pace with the changes in use of Commonwealth waters and thus stays effective in ensuring sustainable management of the resource.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fishing by Indigenous Australians should also be recognised as a sector in its own right in fishery management regimes, including for any traditional customary fishing rights. It is important that governments recognise and understand the strong relationship Indigenous people have with fishery resources and ensure the fisheries management frameworks appropriately accommodate sustainable cultural fishing through greater and more meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I rise to present to the Australian Senate a Private Senators' Bill – the Criminal Code Amendment (Prohibition of Full Face Coverings in Public Places) Bill 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995</span> to increase security in all public places covered under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and promote civil harmony and assimilation in a climate of increasing public safety issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Private Senators' Bill will make it an offence to wear full face coverings in a public place under Commonwealth jurisdiction, as well as forcing another person or child to wear a full face covering - unless otherwise authorised or excused by law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, the threat from organised crime and terrorism is real. Members of our military are overseas helping fight a war that has been declared on Australia and our democratic allies by organised extremists because of who we are and our love for democracy. Gone are the easy days of the past where we knew and trusted our neighbours and left our backdoors unlocked. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this time of heightened security the safety and feelings of safety for members of the Australian public and a guarantee of open communication between citizens must be paramount. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a clear national security need to bring in a nationwide ban on all identity concealing garments, unless the wearer has a reasonable and lawful excuse to wear those garments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And while some small groups of people may make an argument that their right to express their religious feelings or views by wearing identity concealing garments is being limited, the security and the safety of the community must always come first. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Moreover, the community must <span style="font-style:italic;">feel </span>safe. Full face coverings such as helmets, masks, balaclavas and other facial coverings worn in public without good reason, often cause unnecessary fear with the Australian general public. Therefore, the security and safety will be enhanced with the introduction of this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I remind the people who argue that this Bill impacts on the religious freedoms of some groups of people living in Australia that linking the restrictions on facial coverings to the National Terrorism Threat Level is a reasonable and balanced approach to maintaining and enhancing public security. Especially at a time when our security agencies are certain that further deadly public attacks by extremists and enemies of Australia will happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore the right to feel safe in public places for the general public in a secular, democratic society, in a time of extreme threat from terrorism - must always outweigh the right for expression of religious freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are not the only people who have expressed concerns and feel unsafe when citizens wear full face coverings without good reason in public. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a secular State, France has already banned face coverings in public spaces, including masks, helmets, balaclavas, burqas and niqabs. In France, the law defines public space to include the street, museums, shops, public transportation, parks, banks and even during the course of employment within the public sector. According to Parliamentary Library research, Belgium and Turkey have also successfully implemented similar laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even a number of Muslim countries have 'banned the burqa' as it were, recognising the security risk it poses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Egypt, Chad, Tunisia, Morocco, Cameroon, and Niger have bans on burqas and Senegal is currently considering whether to impose one. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My Private Senators' Bill links the prohibition of full face coverings to the National Terrorism Threat Level, to be activated when the terrorism threat level reaches 'Probable'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By doing this, the public can feel at ease knowing the Government is doing everything it can to protect its citizens in the face of the growing threat of terrorism. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Full face coverings conceal the identity of the wearer, disrupting the authorities' ability to track down a perpetrator in the event of a crime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Prohibiting the use of full face coverings also acts as a deterrent to those who contemplate committing a crime. This prohibition promotes public safety by making it easier to identify everyone. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation will enable all Australians who want to go peacefully about their business, to feel safe in public spaces. It does so by enacting commonsense security provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I emphasise that the primary purpose of this Bill is public safety. When people have the intention of committing a crime, in many cases, they attempt to conceal their identity so they have the best chance of evading the law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While this Bill takes into account exceptions for full face coverings in the genuine pursuit of entertainment, work, and artistic purpose; the right of the Australian public to be and feel safer when the official terrorism threat is at the third highest level or probable, must be the primary consideration of the Government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  The government is committed to ensuring that children right across Australia have access to a dentist when they need it. Under the scheme, on average, only $312 of the rebate has been reclaimed per child each year. In light of this, the government had previously set the cap at $700 per child over a two-year period, which would still allow children to visit a dentist regularly. However, following consultation with the Australian Dental Association, the Minister for Health has decided to reinstate the cap at $1,000. We are also providing $11 million over two years to the Royal Flying Doctor Service to deliver dental outreach services to rural and remote communities. The government is delivering on its commitment to improve the dental health of all Australians though the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and contribute to better public dental services through a national partnership agreement with the states and territories.</span>

Indeed, the motion attributes 'Australia's remarkable democratic and constitutional stability' to the Queen. Well, the last time I checked, Australia's most serious constitutional crisis, the dismissal, saw the Queen's representative, the Governor-General, dismiss a sitting Prime Minister. Australia's stability is due to its democratic institutions that underpin our nation. May that long continue with an Australian head of state and a flag to call our own.</span>

                    </a>  The ability to establish a sovereign submarine capability within Australia has been a prime focus of the Future Submarines Program. Appropriate arrangements for the ownership of and rights to use intellectual property have been implemented with the government of France and DCNS, drawing on the extensive experience of the Collins submarine program. The details of intellectual property arrangements with DCNS are of significant commercial value and highly sensitive to DCNS. It would be inappropriate to disclose such clauses which could disadvantage DCNS and advantage its competitors in business operations. Further, given the role of DCNS in delivering French national submarine programs, such disclosure could reasonably be expected to also damage international relations with France. In accordance with the relevant commercial and public interest immunity considerations, the government will not release the clauses and opposes this motion.</span>

                  </a>  Australia is consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. The government takes a zero tolerance approach to corruption in all its forms. The establishment of a national integrity commission would not better guarantee protections against corruption. A robust multi-agency approach is preferable to creating an entirely new agency. No single overarching body should be responsible for tackling corruption. By dispersing responsibility accountability increases. We have strong laws and a robust multi-agency approach to combating corruption. A range of agencies play a role in preventing, detecting and responding to corruption, including the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the AFP hosted Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre and the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. </span>

It will canvass a whole range of issues that we believe are worth being examined further before taking a final position on the issue of a national integrity commission. So we are not in a position today to support this motion from the Greens. </span>

                  </a>  If there is any lesson that we could learn from the huge disruption that is going on right around the world and indeed here in Australia to 'politics as usual', it is that people are fed up with the level of representation they are getting. They have no faith that their elected representatives are actually representing them, and they believe that we need to clean up politics. We have seen evidence of corruption at a state level, particularly in New South Wales but not limited to New South Wales. We have seen the role of these national anti-corruption watchdogs in ensuring that they keep a check on government, politicians and the bureaucracy. It is time for action now. It is not time for more inquiries, not time for more talk but time for action. Let's establish a national anti-corruption watchdog. Let's get on with the business of cleaning up politics.

We do support much of Senator Wong's motion, so will not be opposing it, but we want to make it very clear that Australia does have a discriminatory migration policy. If we were serious about having a fair and non-discriminatory migration system, we would end offshore detention, close the camps and bring the people on Manus Island and Nauru here to Australia so that we could try to help them repair some of the harm that we have caused them.</span>

We should have a day where we celebrate this great country of ours, celebrate its magnificent Indigenous history and celebrate the many waves of migration that followed, but 26 January, the day of dispossession, is not that day. Our entire national wealth was built from that moment, but we still have not paid the rent—no treaty, no constitutional recognition and very little progress. Celebrating on 26 January is an insult to the owners of this land from whom we have taken so much but given so little.</span>

By the way, it is about time we changed the flag while we are at it. The motion cites a poll. I would be wary of citing polls, because you know what happened last time the coalition got worried about polls? They changed their leader.</span>

                  </a>:  The opposition will not be supporting this motion, because, as a matter of principle, we cannot support motions that amount to a personal attack on individual senators. We do proudly support our national day, Australia Day, which should be a day of national celebration and national pride, where we can celebrate all of the good things that it means to be Australian and the great fortune we have to live in this country, the best country on earth. But, of course, this does not mean forgetting our national scars. The opposition understands that for many first Australians this date still carries much sadness, following too many long years of indignities, great and small. The opposition believes that as a nation we must honour the keepers of the world's oldest living culture, the caretakers of this ancient continent, and pledge ourselves to working together for a more equal future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I also want to be clear in saying that violence has no place in the celebrations of our national day or any part to play in our communities at all. Violence will not right past wrongs and it will not create a better future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What is reassuring to me, though, is that faced with the glaring lack of leadership from our Prime Minister and indeed from this parliament we are seeing people organise, mobilise and resist right around the streets.

                  </a>  In line with the government's long-standing view, motions that cannot be debated or amended should not deal with complex foreign policy matters. The Australia-US alliance is based on enduring national strategic and economic interests and very close people-to-people ties spanning business, culture, tourism, trade and education. The United States is Australia's most significant trade and investment partner and an important guarantor of the rules based order, providing the security and stability that has allowed our region to prosper. Australia has a strong and productive relationship with the US and looks forward to continuing to build on that with the new US administration. The Leader of the Greens should not be playing political games on important issues of national security.</span>

He apparently is not left-wing enough and the dictation has come down from Left Renewal—he has his little script there from the politburo—and they have told him that he has to toughen up a bit and start attacking the American president. We may not all agree, and a lot of people have different views on foreign policy, especially when it comes to United States, but what we do not do is engage in these desperate, pathetic, stupid, silly, embarrassing stunts in the Senate day after day. I get it: you need to go back to the Left. I get it: your base is moving on you. I understand that. But, please, just be a professional at it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="225099" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DASTYARI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  It is the start of a new Senate year, and what a start it has been. We have seen a government that is divided and falling apart. It is the Seinfeld government: it is a government that has recalled parliament, brought us back here today, for the simple reason that it was on the calendar—there is nothing to actually do. There is no legislation, there is no purpose and there is no point. All we are doing here is pretending that this is a government that has some kind of control.  They started off on the first day with some terrible polling numbers—54-46. None of us in this business follow polling; there is only the one poll that matters, the one on election day. But that news suddenly got surpassed by Senator Bernardi quitting the Liberal Party—quitting a party that it appeared he was running; quitting a party which, in the seven months since the last election, had done everything he asked for. He could not point to any policy difference, but he left—a complete vote of no confidence in Malcolm Turnbull. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, what have we seen this past week? This is something that has frustrated me: we are hearing politician after politician and senator after senator talk about the establishment and talk about the insiders. Let us be clear: if you are an old, white, rich, male senator you are the establishment. You are the system. We are hearing these government ministers talking about the establishment and saying, 'We will make Australia great again,' running their Trump lines. They are the government. People like George Christensen from the other place and Senator Bernardi and others go out and talk about making Australia great again, but they have been running this country for over a term now. They have set the rules. They have set the policies. We hear all about insiders and outsiders, and we have commentator after commentator going on shows like <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span> talking about how they have been silenced and they do not have a voice anymore. If you have your own nightly television show you are not being silenced this country. Maybe no-one is watching, but if you have two to three hours on either radio or television every single day you are not someone whose voice has been silenced. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is this whole debate about where things are heading. You have a government that is folding on 18C and the rights of individuals. Why? Because of the power of right-wing shock jocks. You have a government that has fallen over already on the issue of marriage equality. It cannot come to a position. In the paper on the weekend we read that a handful—and perhaps even more than a handful—of backbenchers and others want to see marriage equality happen in this country, but they have been silenced. Their voices are not being heard in the Liberal Party. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is madness that we put so much focus on and so much effort into going after people on Centrelink benefits and yet the government talks about $50 billion worth of tax cuts for Australia's largest companies, over $7 billion of which will go to the four largest banks. We talk about inequality, and it is growing. We also talk about housing affordability—in a place like Sydney the median house price is $1.2 million.</span>

I would love to, the only problem is you have cut so many regional services and regional jobs that, unfortunately, people do not actually have the opportunity or ability to move to these places. Perhaps if you actually believed in rail and perhaps if you were prepared to do something about climate change or even the jobs of the future there would be more opportunity and hope—and perhaps if you could even get the NBN up properly out there. Oh, that is right; Tony Windsor made sure you could! It is a government that has already fallen apart. It is a government that is spiralling out. It is a government that goes from one crisis to another, and for the nation the sooner we are rid of this mob the better.</span>

                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I am delighted to participate in this debate, because I entirely agree that there is no leadership from Mr Turnbull. You have no better display of that than today's debacle—the latest debacle, I should I say; I will come to the other one that we have been talking about, Centrelink, in a minute. But today there is the debacle of the government's announcement of their latest omnicuts, in the guise of, 'Here we are we, we are providing better child care for you and we are providing better paid parental leave for you.' But they are sneaking a whole lot of their other zombie budget cut measures back in. These are the budget cut measures that this Senate has been resisting ever since they started showing up in the Abbott budget of 2014. Remember that awful budget, which was overwhelmingly rejected by the community? They tried to force young people off income support, off Newstart, for six months. This government think they can get away with reducing the period to five weeks—four weeks plus the normal one-week wait period. Clearly this Senate has been resisting that and not supporting it. Now they bring it back, supposedly to pay for child care. Even if you accept the premise that child care is all fixed, they are saying, 'We will look after your kids while they need child care, but as soon as they reach the age of being more independent and they look for work and become unemployed, we will not support them.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you look at what they are trying to do to age pensions and portability. They are trying to reduce that to six weeks. Then they will have you believe that they have fixed things by improving the changes they are making to family tax benefits, but young families will still be worse off. Where is the leadership?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'That's right: we're leading by picking on the most vulnerable members of our community, those that are struggling, those that are trying to buy a home, those that are on low incomes. We will still decrease your family tax benefit: if you are on family tax benefit A, by about $8 a fortnight; if you are on family tax benefit B, which is where there are a lot of low-income families, we will reduce it by over $13 a fortnight.' This is not leadership; it is demonising people. It is demonising the most vulnerable members of our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then let's get to Centrelink. What great leadership there! How to lead a complete debacle! Again, it is subjecting people that are trying to rely on our social security safety net to scare tactics, to debt notices, to potentially having to open the door to debt collectors, and to errors in Centrelink which they do not even count. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today during senators' statements, I read out the accounts of three people who have been affected by this. Great leadership by the Turnbull government: how to pick on and make vulnerable people even more vulnerable; how to make sure that they have more mental health issues. That is what is happening and that is what is being fed to our offices. I am sure those on the government benches have been getting those phone calls—in fact, some of their own are so affected and so concerned that they have been making statements about their concerns. Great leadership, Mr Turnbull!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is his leadership in taking the issues to President Trump? It is completely lacking; it is not there. He is failing Australians, and particularly failing those that rely on our social security safety net and families that are struggling to get ahead. We know they are struggling to buy their homes; we know they are facing greater costs of living; we know that inequality in this country is increasing. So he is leading the charge to increase inequality in this country. That is the only thing he is leading on. That is not the way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By victimising and picking on the most vulnerable in the community, he increases inequality and makes it even harder for people to find work. By keeping young people in poverty and off Newstart for five weeks, he actually makes it harder for them to find work. That is what the evidence shows. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I support this matter of public importance because the Prime Minister is not— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  What a great opportunity it is this afternoon to continue to talk about the inability of the Turnbull government to provide any sort of stable leadership of this great nation. What we do know is that Christmas has come and gone but the Christmas presents this government keeps presenting to us and giving us day after day and week after week are stuff-ups. They have had a ghastly start to the year. Mr Turnbull would be feeling, I would say, quite insecure. What we have seen this week in this chamber is Senator Cory Bernardi deserting the Liberal Party. This is one of theirs saying there is no leadership and that they are not giving the leadership that this country so richly deserves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not see this government going out and creating the jobs that it gave a commitment to during the last election; instead, we see them infighting amongst themselves. We have seen no economic strategy. The Prime Minister has no plans for the future of this country, not when it comes to economics—not at all. We have not seen any of those jobs that they promised at the last election. But what we have seen is the absolutely disgusting Centrelink robo-debt debacle which has impacted on everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember the census failure. We know that the ATO was offline for a week. We know that the GP tax and freezing the Medicare levy to GPs has had an enormous impact. And we know that this month is ovarian cancer awareness month. But if you cannot get in to see your GP—and I gave a speech this morning in relation to women making sure that if they do have the symptoms and signs they should go to a GP and should get a second opinion. All I can say is this government has done nothing but cut health. They have cut funding to our schools. We know they want to bring in $100,000 degrees. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not matter what media you pick up over the last four or five weeks—in fact, it is probably over the last 18 months, since the Prime Minister has taken over the reins of leadership of the Liberal Party. I would just like to quote from <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> journalist Tom Switzer who said on Monday that the Prime Minister 'came to power on a wave of personal popularity, but has lacked conviction' and 'has not lived up to expectations'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the Prime Minister's economic management that has disappointed people the most. We know Mr Turnbull did promise a lot when he knifed Tony Abbott. But he has delivered nothing. In an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>—not actually a paper that is renowned for supporting this side of the chamber—political editor Dennis Shanahan said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The senator’s actions are pure disruption and division. He has damaged the Coalition, hurt the Liberal Party and further splintered the choice for conservative voters, …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bernardi, once again, has destabilised Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership, …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… … …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Bernardi has reopened all the political wounds within the Liberal Party, the Coalition and conservative MPs themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It just keeps going. There is another quote I want to give, from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> today—and this is all because of Senator Bernardi, who has joined so many others throughout this country. This government is a failure. The Prime Minister is a failure. He has failed the Australian people. The editor's piece in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> this morning said that Cory Bernardi was 'wrong to leave the party'. It said that Bernardi 'could have made all of the points he did yesterday and been influential in arguing them without leaving the Liberal Party'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He made very clear the reasons he left the Liberal Party. This is not a government that is living up to the expectations of even their own supporter base. Their attack—when it comes to GPs and having them out campaigning against this government—and we remember what happened with the pathology industry when they came out against them and then they had to come to a quick deal so they would not go out and lose the financial support that they normally get.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is one economic plan that this Prime Minister keeps repeating every single opportunity he can, and that is his big plan to give the $50 billion tax cut to the big end of town. We know that he supports the banks. Why does he support the banks? Because they bankrolled the Liberal Party. He is not the only one who bankrolled the Liberal Party; it is also the big banks. But he did not want to have a royal commission into the banks, and they were critical about the royal commission into child sexual exploitation. What have we seen from that? We believe that this government is a failure. The Australian people see them as a failure. Mr Malcolm Turnbull has not delivered on one economic promise. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I hope the clock was stopped for that. Let me address some of Senator Polley's points. I have been observing this for about 12 months now, particularly during these opportunities pursuant to standing order 75 to listen to the topics that have been chosen by the Australian Labor Party. When you listen to their contributions, there is nothing. There is no contribution. It is just a hollow vessel—complaining, whining and whingeing. I had a bearing like that in the back of my ute a couple of weeks ago. Give it a shot of grease and the noise went away. That is what you and the Labor Party need, Senator Polley: you need a bucket of grease, because all you do is whinge and whine. It is all negative. There is no alternative; there is no 'You don't get it right with education—here's what you should do.' </span>

                  </a>  I will make every effort. I have made the point before: you always know that you are on the money when the members of the Labor Party stand up to interrupt your delivery. Let's talk about what this government has done, because, unlike yourselves, I am prepared to make a positive contribution. I am not frightened to lay down the programs, initiatives and achievements of this government. They have been enormous. This has been one of the most active governments on delivery for the Australian people that we have seen in my adult lifetime. Let's just run through a few things from my home state of Queensland—</span>

                  </a>  I cannot even hear myself think with Senator Polley going off like polly with a cracker. Our Commonwealth government has just lodged about $10 billion into the upgrade of the Bruce Highway in my home state of Queensland. It will affect dozens upon dozens of communities and, more importantly, the economies of those rural and provincial communities and, in fact, some big, proud cities—Townsville, where the good senator's office is; Cairns; Rockhampton; Bundaberg. The investment by our government is going to almost flood-proof the Bruce Highway. It is going to upgrade it for all those billions of dollars of trade and development that occurs up and down our coastline. We are going to have an efficient method—do not go, Senator Polley, you should listen to some of this—of delivery of goods to our ports to underpin our great terms of trade. We already heard today about the wonderful terms of trade figures that came out on the weekend. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government delivered the Range Crossing. Under Labor they seesawed, they hummed and haaed for six years. Not one thing did they do towards the development of that terrific initiative to build the Range Crossing so that all the products of our trade-exposed nation—over 70 per cent of what we produce, including 66 per cent of the beef sector, a commodity now worth about $10.5 billion to our economy, to your welfare, to underpinning the wealth of this nation, comes down the Range Crossing. Who was it that built the Range Crossing? That would be this government. That is not taking into account the half a billion dollars spent on the Warrego Highway or the half a billion that is now pledged and is in the planning phase to put beef roads all over the state to create a trunk road network up there that will just enhance this $10.5 billion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wants to talk about comparisons. Let's talk about things like the live export trade. Let me ask you, Senator Macdonald—I know you do not have a calculator, but I suspect you might get this one—in 2011 how many cattle were exported to Indonesia and other places, the live cattle that underpin the massive beef industry of northern Australia? How many were there? I heard you—there were none, because you brought that trade to its knees. There are thousands—in fact, tens of thousands—of families who continue to have that play through their balances sheets, affecting them. There is a generation of farmers who have lost their farms and businesses; industries that disappeared off the face of the planet in the Northern Territory.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we do? We reinstated that trade, and now Australia exports more live cattle into the region than anyone else in the world, restoring—though not for the poor people who fell over or were pushed over by Labor policies—confidence in that marketplace and allowing people to build businesses, with the dignity that comes with that, in northern Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just deal with northern Australia. My good friend here, Senator Macdonald, played a very significant and influential part in an inquiry that our government conducted. Where did it end up? What would Labor have done for northern Australia in the whole time they were there? That would be nothing, starting with an 'n' and finishing with a 'g'. Absolutely nothing. But our government put in place a $5 billion—</span>

                  </a>  I might point out to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that is the fourth failed point of order made by the colleagues on the other side. It is just meant to disrupt my delivery. It really does grind on them when these achievements are listed one after the other after they have had 10 minutes talking in such a nefarious fashion suggesting that this government has not done anything. We roll these achievements out one after the other. We are a government that has a plan. We are a government that told the people of Australia what we would do. They endorsed us. They put us back in power. That is what they did. They rejected this negative, hollow vacuum of a policy arrangement with the Australian Labor Party and the Greens. They are frightened of the Greens. We have seem that in the decline in the vote for the Greens party. I know that it really gets on your goat over that side when we are able to list one project after another—billions of dollars, even in the tough economic climate that you left us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let me say this: when we get a statement 'the inability of the Turnbull government to provide stable, united leadership', well, what an absolute nonsense. Those achievements that I have outlined—and I am certain that Senator Macdonald is going to outline a couple hundred more—cannot happen unless you have a stable, majority government well led right across this nation. This nation has benefited from Turnbull and Abbott. It will continue to benefit because of the stability that we bring to the administration of the Commonwealth of the great nation of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  The Prime Minister's bad news week will continue when he returns to Sydney. When he goes to his Point Piper mansion on that multimillion dollar street he will have to navigate his way around a giant sinkhole. A giant sinkhole, believe it or not, has opened up. So we have this perfect metaphor. Not only is he falling into a hole in terms of how he is handling his policy work in Canberra; he will literally have to navigate his way around one when he returns to Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people were led to believe that when Malcolm Turnbull became the Prime Minister there would be some good news there—that on climate change and marriage equality things would change, that there would be a trickle-down and, in time, there would be some good outcomes. But on both of these issues he has been gutless. Of course he has continued to be, as he was in his previous job outside parliament, a salesman for the super rich, for privatisation and for profit. That is the driving aspect of this government. That is what they are out to do. That is where the Prime Minister gives leadership—in delivering in that way. He is delivering in a way that brings the hardship, the inequality, the job insecurity, the environmental damage that has now become the hallmark of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do agree with the analysis that you hear from some that part of Mr Turnbull's problem is that he is locked on to the extreme Right in his party. Yes, that is the case. But it is also the case that the job of the Liberals and Nationals and the job of the Prime Minister is to deliver for their constituency. And their constituency is corporate Australia. Corporate Australia's job, while they are on the earth, is to make profits. How do they increase their profits? They do so by getting this government, the Liberals and Nationals, to weaken environmental standards and labour standards. When workers are not being paid as much and when occupational health and safety conditions are run down, and when you can ignore putting in any standards about clean air and clean water, there will be more profits. That is where this constituency—the big end of town; corporate Australia—is benefiting from the likes of the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just take industrial relations as an example. This is where you do not see any finesse from the government. It really is a position in which they are out there to smash unions and weaken workers' rights. We saw it so clearly with the Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation. Now, as we have seen this week, we have this disgraceful backflip from Senator Hinch. The government wants to make this very ugly piece of legislation even harsher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The building code, which is a key part of the ABCC, puts in restrictions on the enterprise bargaining agreements linked with Commonwealth-funded work. This is really worth understanding because it highlights the hypocrisy that you hear from Liberal and National senators and MPs in the other place time and time again. The code prohibits not only union-friendly but: enterprise bargaining agreements from including clauses that encourage the employment of apprentices; requiring employers to look for local workers first; preventing unlimited ordinary working hours; allowing construction workers to have a fair and safe workplace. Remember all those fine speeches that you heard from Minister Cash and from the MPs in the other place? This puts the lie to what they actually stand for. On all those things, how could you disagree with clauses about more apprentices, fair working hours, a safer workplace and more jobs locally? But it goes that far. That is what you end up with. That is what Mr Turnbull is overseeing at every turn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the really big standout: there was Mr Turnbull putting $1.75 million into the Liberal Party to, literally, buy the election. We will be hearing more from Minister Ryan on how they are going to clean up political donations. But the furthest they will go is possibly bringing in a ban on overseas donations, and transparency. If we get that, it is all important; very important. But we need to have caps. We need to have limits on the amount of money that can be spent on elections and, certainly, an end to the damaging corporate donations. At the moment, the culture is changing in Australia. We are getting to a point that the super rich like Malcolm Turnbull can buy elections. But it does not look like he can buy his way out of a sinkhole or a policy hole.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  I intend to use that nomenclature because I still think that should be the case. Sometimes in this chamber there is serious debate that achieves the purpose. More often than not this chamber hears a lot of what can only be described as high farce. And I have to say that this debate today is one of those that is super high farce. First of all, we have Senator Dastyari leading the debate for the Labor Party. Senator Dastyari is a nice enough guy, personally, but why would you put as your party whip someone who got Chinese companies to pay his personal debts? These were not debts to the Labor Party, but his own personal debts. He was dismissed from the front bench for a couple of months and here he is back again leading the Labor Party as a whip. This is the same guy who, when he was General Secretary of New South Wales Labor, looked after Craig Thomson. Remember that crook, that cheat, that guy who I am embarrassed to say was a fellow parliamentarian in the other chamber for a number of years? He told lie after lie and took the hard-earned money of workers and members of the health union, but who stood up for him? Who paid his legal bills? Senator Dastyari, as general secretary of the Australian Labor Party. Yet here he is, promoted to the position of a whip in this chamber and leading the debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He led the debate with the massive comment: 'We haven't done any work today, since the parliament has resumed. We sit around trying to find legislation.' I am not sure where Senator Dastyari was today when we passed, after quite significant debate, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016. That debate actually happened, and I do not know where Senator Dastyari was if he is suggesting that we are not debating any legislation in the first full day back in the parliament. Senator Dastyari may not be aware that we are currently dealing with the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill. It is a bill that I have spoken on, but I am not sure whether Senator Dastyari has—he must not have, because he seems to think there has been no legislation discussed in this chamber. The chamber red, the agenda for the chamber, is full of important legislation which this government wants to bring forward and which is getting through the chamber. For that we have to thank the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull, the unity of the government and the determination of the government to do positive things for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had my staff spend a few hours—it took that long—to get me a list of this government's achievements. I only have 17 minutes today but I have four pages of achievements, so time will permit me to mention only a few of them. Before I start, Senator Dastyari had the hide to talk about Mr Turnbull's leadership. I have had my arguments with Mr Turnbull at times, and because I am in the Liberal Party I am able to do that. Just yesterday I had an argument with him in the party room. But we are allowed to do that in the Liberal Party. We do not get shunned, we do not get sacked and we do not get dismissed if that happens. Senator Dastyari complains about Mr Turnbull but he supports Mr Bill Shorten, the most unimpressive Leader of the Opposition that I have seen in my 26 years in this chamber. I think he is hopeless, I think he shows no leadership at all, I think he is a complete waste of space—as some would say, an oxygen thief—but do not take my word for it; ask the public of Australia. Malcolm Turnbull's approval rating as preferred Prime Minister has gone up, Senator Dastyari, and your leader's has gone down or stayed the same. You have the hide—you have the high farce, I should say—to complain about Mr Turnbull's leadership when you have a leader that the Australian public has no regard for. Long, I might say, may Mr Shorten reign, because as long as Mr Shorten remains your leader—I do not think it will be very long—we are safe. In fact, I am part of the 'keep Bill Shorten' brigade, because the best thing that can happen to our party politically is to make sure that Bill Shorten remains the leader of the alternative government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be positive about this debate. Senator Dastyari and other Labor speakers say nothing has happened. I know they wish nothing had happened but they will remember, regretfully, as they go home to Sydney every weekend—their union mates belt them around the ears over this—that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill was passed by this parliament. The Building and Construction Commission bill, admittedly in watered-down form, was passed by this parliament. I know Labor hated that, and I know their union mates who put them in this chamber hated it even more, but these bills have been passed by a government, led by Mr Turnbull, that has shown real leadership and courage. Why did that happen? Because Mr Turnbull had the courage to call a double dissolution. I disagreed with that and I made my views known to Mr Turnbull, but it looks like, in retrospect, perhaps he was right, because those two bills that we went to a double dissolution on have now been passed by the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rarely believe what I read in the papers and I believe what I hear on the ABC even less. But from the headlines of <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> this morning, I understand that my colleague Senator Hinch has indicated—as he indicated to a group that I was talking to with him a few weeks or months ago—that he did not quite understand the import of the amendment that he supported in relation to the ABCC bill, which effectively delayed the corruption-fighting element of that bill for two years. If you believe what you read in the paper, Senator Hinch has now agreed to join the government to bring that bill back to what it should have been and stop the corrupt practices of several unions immediately—or in a very short period of time—rather than delaying it for two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would take me more than a day to list the achievements of this government. Although I am a Queensland senator I am passionate about Northern Australia—as Senator O'Sullivan kindly said, it has been a passion of mine for a long time. I will quickly run through some of this government's initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that Senator Dastyari says has done nothing. He says that there has been no leadership and that it has achieved nothing. Let me go through this. Under the Beef Roads program, which Senator O'Sullivan mentioned, there are now roads criss-crossing Queensland like never before—since the Fraser years, I have to say. The CRC on northern Australia is about to be announced, I believe, next week. Under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, $5 billion is set aside for cheap loans for infrastructure development in the north. Then there are the water storage proposals. This government has provided $137 million to build the Rockwood dam, a much-needed dam near Rockhampton. There is the Charleston dam near Forsayth. Probably none of you, not even the Queenslanders, would know where Forsayth is. It is a little country town up in the Gulf. There is $10 million for the Charleston dam in that community, which supports a local cattle industry and, I might say, has a very good and productive Indigenous community who will benefit from the dam. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you go to Townsville, where my office is, not far from where I live. We have the eastern rail network, with the whole new proposal to bring trains into the Townsville port quickly and efficiently. We have the Townsville stadium, which this government is going to fund. We have the northern Australian plan, which is being implemented step by step. In addition to that, over the last couple of months when parliament has not been sitting I have been moving around Queensland and visiting aged-care homes. The amount of money that goes into aged-care homes is just enormous. There is always a lot more needed, and I have been making submissions to the minister for some of the homes that I have visited. Gee, there are a lot of things going on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Minister Ley—all credit to her; she was a wonderful health minister—the health system was really turned around. We are hearing about achievements all the time. In question time we heard about a drug that has been put on the PBS that used to cost $104,000 per treatment and that now costs $38 per treatment. That is just one. I was involved in another initiative of this government for hepatitis—I can almost call it a hepatitis cure. It is another of those drugs that was available if you had a spare $80,000 to buy the treatment. Under this government you now pay $38. This is the leadership of this government, and Senator Dastyari says nothing has happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have actually stopped the boats. I know the Labor Party hate this and they hate the five-word slogan, but, sorry, it is true: we have stopped the boats. We were criticised by all those holier than thou people in Europe when we were doing this a few years ago. What are those holier than thou countries in Europe now doing? They are making a beeline to our door to find out how we did it. We have done it and every other country in the world is now trying to find out how. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Turnbull showed real leadership in standing up to the President of the United States over the deal that had been made on the illegal maritime arrivals who are now not coming to Australia and never will. But they will go to the United States because of the deal done between Australia and the former President, Mr Obama. The news reports were that President Trump did not want to proceed with the deal. We know the truth of the very robust conversation between Mr Turnbull and President Trump, in which Mr Turnbull was able to ensure that the deal that was made would continue. There we have it: real leadership has been shown at a time when all those opposite can do, particularly the Greens,  is whinge about Mr Trump—a democratically elected leader of another country. He was trying to break an agreement that his country had made with Australia. Thanks to Mr Turnbull—we all owe him a debt of gratitude for this—he was able to ensure that the deal stood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs have been created at Alcoa's Portland aluminium smelter. There is the new agreement with the French to build submarines in Australia. Senator Dastyari talks about this do-nothing government—but how about, just last year, the biggest ever defence white paper, with record spending planned and budgeted for, reversing the running down of our defence forces by the Labor Party. We have finalised the Western Sydney airport project. We have delivered fairer, more sustainable and more flexible superannuation. We have boosted infrastructure through a 15-year plan. We have delivered on northern Australia as promised. We have established the Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land. We have banned excessive surcharging by credit card companies. We have employment initiatives that connect veterans with jobs. We have ratified the Paris agreement on climate change—I might say that is one that I am not quite sure was a step in the right direction, but it is something this government has done. Senator Dastyari said that this government has done nothing. We have secured Australia's 25th consecutive year of economic growth. Our growth is faster than that of every other G7 economy. We have introduced legislation to enshrine our border protection laws. We have had to do that up against constant interference from the Greens political party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have passed through the lower house the bill to give Australians a say on whether they support same-sex marriage or not. If it had not been for the Greens and the Labor Party in this chamber stopping that legislation, in one month's time we would have had an answer on that. If, as those who want same-sex marriage say, the vote on the plebiscite would have been positive, same-sex couples would have been able to get married the next day. But, thanks to Labor and the Greens, that is one failure that I guess this government has had. Although we tried to get that plebiscite through, thanks to Labor and the Greens that has not happened and we will go through another 10 years of uncertainty. I hope that those who advocate for same-sex marriage thank the Greens and the Labor Party for denying Australians the right to that vote. According to that lobby, it would have passed easily.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have delivered a personal income tax break to 500,000 middle-income Australians. We have delivered $21 billion of budget repair. We have made bank CEOs answerable to the public through regular appearances before parliamentary committees. We have improved national security.

                  </a>  I know that Senator Macdonald keeps commenting that he has been here for 26 years, but sometimes it is quality not quantity that is important in life. As Senator Macdonald comes back to Canberra and steps into Parliament House, I have this feeling that he steps through the wardrobe, as though he has gone to Narnia or to another land because most of what he said to me was a fiction.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Macdonald started out bagging poor old Senator Dastyari, who has been the deputy whip for the last couple of days, and I am honoured that he has taken the position from me. I am very happy to have supported him in that. To be honest, he has freed me from the shackles—as you would know, Senator Smith—of being a deputy whip. I am glad that he put his hand up for that position.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a really torrid time for the Turnbull government, which is what we are here to speak about today. It is a government at war with itself. It is fraught with its own internal squabbles. It lacks in policy, it lacks in leadership and it lacks in competence to create a brighter future for Australian people. It was bad enough over the summer break that they lost their health minister, who had 29 or 32—and I am happy to be corrected on the exact number—flights to the Gold Coast to buy property at taxpayers' expense. So Minister Ley is no longer the minister because of that, and Senator Macdonald comes in here and preaches to us about things that have happened on this side. Really, I think that is the pot calling the kettle black. It really is just atrocious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate we get Senator Sinodinos, who I quite like as a person. I do get on well with Senator Sinodinos. If anyone in this place has the right to say 'I cannot remember' or 'I cannot recall', obviously it is me, because I have had brain surgery. But Senator Sinodinos does not have that excuse. He stood up in an inquiry and said 32 times—if my memory serves me correctly, but once again I am always happy to be corrected—that he could not recall something and now he has a post on the front bench. That is absolutely atrocious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see with the government and with Mr Turnbull in particular is that they are always forced to cave in to the extreme right of the Liberal Party. They are forced to cave in to the right-wing ideologues like Mr Christensen and Senator Abetz and, until yesterday of course, Senator Bernardi, who was calling most of the shots. Although I do think that Senator Bernadi in his position on the crossbench will still call a lot of the shots. They will want his vote. If Senator Bernardi really stopped and thought about things and listened to the way he was being bagged out by a number of his so-called colleagues, he might not really vote with them all that often. But I am sure he will still pull a lot of the strings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the summer break, I actually started to feel sorry for Mr Turnbull. I thought to myself, 'There he is, looking over the waters in his Point Piper mansion, sipping on his cognac and wondering to himself how it all went so wrong.' A lot of people had a lot of faith in Mr Turnbull when he took over from Mr Abbott, and some people on our side even had some faith in Mr Turnbull because we thought he would be progressive and make some changes. But what do we see? We see that he has actually backflipped on all the key things he said he believed in. He backflipped on marriage equality, on reducing carbon pollution, on an Australian republic, on Gonski and on Safe Schools. They all lie in ashes at his feet since he took over as Prime Minister. This government, as we know, is completely dysfunctional, and part of the problem is that instead of rejecting Mr Abbott's policies, Mr Turnbull has doubled down on them. I have to say that the Australian people are pretty dismayed about that. I have people coming to me saying they have voted Liberal all their life but would not do it at the next election. Senator Macdonald was bagging out Mr Shorten, as he so often does—it is just a diatribe—but if he was to listen to people around Australia talk about Mr Turnbull, he might not be quite so disparaging. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  Senator Bilyk was certainly on a roll in relation to this matter, and I rise to make my own humble contribution in relation to the inability of the Turnbull government to provide stable leadership for the benefit of all Australians. In the course of the last half an hour or so I have taken the opportunity to listen to Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Macdonald in relation to their very despondent and limited defence of the performance of the Turnbull government. It is quite clear that Senator's Bernardi's defection yesterday is just the latest example in relation to the disunity and chaos of the Turnbull government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leadership is perhaps the most important ingredient to any strong and functional government. But leadership requires a leader to have the courage of their convictions, something the current Prime Minister and the current government is totally lacking. Leadership means you say what you mean and you mean what you say. The Turnbull government's version of leadership is in stark contrast to this. It is characterised by turmoil. I note that back in April last year, seven months into the period of the Turnbull government, Ben Eltham, in <span style="font-style:italic;">New Matilda, </span>noted that Mr Turnbull had notched 17 backflips in seven months. I am not going to go through all of those, but it is quite clear that this is a government that flip-flops from policy to policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make the point that during Senator Macdonald's contribution I thought it was very telling that when asked to defend the achievements of the Turnbull government the first thing Senator Macdonald referred to was an attack on the trade union movement. I suppose the most significant issue they can point to as an achievement of this government is the legislation that goes to tying the hands of the trade union movement in order to prevent it from properly representing the interests of their members. That is I think a very telling aspect of Senator Macdonald's contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the very limited time left to me I want to comment on a couple of policy backflips that I think are most significant in respect of the development of public policy in Australia—firstly, the whole prospect of significant tax reform, which was raised initially by former Prime Minister Abbott and cruelly dashed by incoming Prime Minister Turnbull, who raised expectations about doing something in relation to this matter. There was the prospect, under Prime Minister Abbott, of a tax white paper to have a very holistic look at the system, building on the intergenerational report, the tax discussion paper that so many organisations made very substantial contributions and submissions to, only to find that Prime Minister Turnbull scrapped that whole process and in the course of the lead-up to the election raised the prospect of a corporate tax cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the experts are divided as to whether that will actually provide any significant contribution to the Australian economy. In fact, much of the benefit of that goes to the four major banks—benefits which go to foreign investors, and it is debatable as to whether that is actually going to see more investment in Australia. And of course our system of franked credits in Australia means that the benefit to Australian investors of a corporate tax cut is somewhat neutered. So, whether or not this actually delivers anything is a moot point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a government that is going to take a step forward for us. Every day that this government fails to step forward, Australians are forced to take a step backward. We need a government that will stand up for Australians and put them in the best position to tackle an ever-changing world. We need a government that will ensure that Australians have access to affordable health care and a decent wage. We do not need a government that is riddled with scandals, a government that undermines its own policy agenda and a government that attacks current and former leaders. I also note that the member for Petrie today reiterated the Treasurer's solution on housing affordability by telling young Australians to 'get a better job', despite youth unemployment being at almost 10 per cent in his own electorate. This is a government that needs to do more than slogans— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  Well, what an extraordinary week it has been. The resignation of a Liberal Party senator is something that does not happen every day. But when it happens on the basis of that particular senator leaving—on the grounds of his convictions, his philosophy—the government benches, it shows clearly the failure of leadership under Malcolm Turnbull that this government currently finds itself in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has been led by a man who many thought would bring a change to the Abbott era and actually move Australia a little bit more forward in a united fashion and stand for something. But unfortunately what we have seen is the complete opposite. We have seen an individual who has completely sold out on just about everything he once stood for. If we look at the issue of climate change, if we look at the issue of renewable energy, of same-sex marriage, of the republic, of 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act—all of these issues are something the Prime Minister has backflipped on. So it should not really be a surprise, in some senses, that now a Liberal Party senator is defecting to form his own party. I think it is symptomatic, that a number of Liberal Party senators perhaps want to do a similar thing. They are not doing it, perhaps, at this stage, but I am sure they are talking about it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as you would understand and expect, there are very, very few issues, if any, that Senator Bernardi and I would agree on. In fact, having spent some time in New York at the United Nations with Senator Bernardi, it became clear to me that there is very little that we do agree on. But, having said that, I think there is one thing that I do agree with him on, and that is the way this government has lost its way—the failure of the Turnbull leadership to actually govern for Australia and the fact that Senator Bernardi clearly is resigning from the Liberal Party standing up for what he actually believes in. Clearly he can no longer stomach this leader who has simply wishy-washed about for his whole time in office by parroting views he does not believe and backflipping on anything he once stood for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst I wish Senator Bernardi well, it does not bode well for the country that senators within the government are resigning. It is a complete show of no confidence in the Prime Minister. And where does it leave this government in its role governing Australia? I think it is time that those opposite recognise that their strategy has not worked under Malcolm Turnbull. I am sure that some on the government side would be thinking Tony Abbott would do a better job. Well, I think there is only one alternative—and the Australian public are becoming more and more aware of it—and that is a Shorten Labor government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak to the tabling of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Digest</span> No. 1 of 2017. As senators would be aware, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has, for the past 35 years, been examining bills against a set of accountability standards that focus on the effect of proposed legislation on individual rights, liberties and obligations and on parliamentary scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so the committee has traditionally tabled two documents, an <span style="font-style:italic;">Alert Digest</span> and a report. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Alert</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span> sets out the committee's initial scrutiny of the bills introduced in the previous sitting week. When concerns are raised in the digest, the committee writes to the minister responsible for the bill inviting the minister to respond to the scrutiny concerns. The committee has then traditionally tabled a report, which sets out the minister's response and any further comments the committee may wish to make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has resolved that from 2017 it will table one document, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Digest</span>, which will replace the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Alert Digest</span> and report. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Digest</span> will continue to contain the committee's initial scrutiny of recently introduced bills, as well as the committee's comments on any responses received on bills previously considered by the committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another new development for the committee in 2017 is the temporary amendment to standing order 24, relating to ministerial responsiveness, which came into operation this week. As senators know, the committee works to ensure, wherever possible, that its comments on bills are available to senators prior to the passage of the bill. As such, where the committee writes to a minister, it expects a response to be received in time to be considered by the committee and reported on while the bill is still before the parliament. While the majority of ministers and departments do work hard to provide timely responses to the committee; unfortunately, there are occasions when responses have not been provided in the time frame requested by the committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is on this basis that the Senate voted last year to temporarily amend the standing orders to give senators the right to ask the responsible minister why the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has not received a response. The committee's website sets out the bills for which responses have been requested and those which are outstanding. This is an important new approach by which senators can obtain information from ministers regarding their responsiveness to the committee's important work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Scrutiny Digest tabled today includes the committee's consideration of a number of bills scheduled for upcoming debate in the Senate, and I encourage my fellow senators and others to examine the digest and consider the scrutiny concerns raised by the committee.</span>

                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-Time" style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the documents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The documents I have tabled on behalf of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee relate to evidence the committee has sought from Australia Post. The committee that I chair has oversight of entities with the highest-paid officials in the Commonwealth: Australia Post and NBN Co. As government business enterprises, the remuneration paid to their executives is relevant when scrutinising the performance of these entities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During supplementary budget estimates, my colleagues Senator Dastyari and Senator Urquhart pursued a line of questioning with Australia Post's managing director regarding both the remuneration he receives and the remuneration paid to other executives at Australia Post. In previous years, the information that senators sought was included in Australia Post's annual reports. Minimum reporting requirements have changed over time and under the current rules Australia Post is not explicitly required to include details about individual executive remuneration in its financial statements. Nevertheless, one would assume that Australia Post would willingly provide such information during Senate estimates if requested.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It therefore came as a surprise that Australia Post sought to provide information about the remuneration received by its Managing Director and other executives on a confidential basis, outside of the estimates process. As senators are aware, all evidence during Senate estimates is to be taken in public session. Senate estimates is a key accountability mechanism, and one of its principal features and strengths is that it is open and transparent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, Australia Post argued that public disclosure of executive remuneration would not be in the public interest. Among the various reasons given was that disclosure may harm the commercial interests of Australia Post and would involve the unreasonable disclosure of personal information. It was also asserted that disclosure of the information would not promote or inform debate about issues of public importance. However, the committee did not accept these reasons. The wider public interest is best served by this information being published. On the environment and communications committee, we do not always agree. In fact, we often disagree. But on this issue, senators from all parties were in unanimous agreement every time we discussed this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators can easily find out the remuneration paid to departmental secretaries and agency heads. We can also find out the remuneration of executives of companies listed on the ASX, such as the CEOs of the major banks. These companies are legally required to disclose senior executive remuneration to inform their shareholders. The salary of the United States Postmaster-General is also reported annually. Despite the transparent remuneration processes that exist elsewhere in the public sector and corporate Australia, the committee was asked to accept that the salary of the Managing Director of Australia Post should be protected from public scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia Post is not a private company. It is a wholly government-owned business enterprise. If anything, we should expect higher standards of disclosure, transparency and accountability of a government enterprise than we do of private companies. The operations of Australia Post clearly have a very large financial significance to the Commonwealth. Accordingly, Australia Post's management should expect tough questions about their performance and the decisions they have taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature of public sector accountability necessitates the open disclosure of key information about the performance and financial position of Commonwealth entities to the parliament. Disclosing information to one committee only, on a confidential basis, is inadequate. All senators have the responsibility to scrutinise public expenditure and the conduct of public administration. We need to assess the relevant information to fulfil this obligation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I anticipate that senators may have further questions about remuneration at Australia Post. It is useful to note that this is not the first statement the committee has made about whether the current approach to disclosure requirements for executive remuneration at Australia Post is adequate. During the previous parliament, when the committee was chaired by my colleague Senator Reynolds, the committee raised this issue when it reported on Australia Post's 2015 annual report. More recently, the disclosure requirements relating to executive remuneration have also attracted the attention of the Auditor-General. In his recent audits of the financial statements of Australian government entities, published in January, the Auditor-General concluded: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There would be benefit in government considering making the aggregate level of transparency for key management personnel remuneration in the public sector consistent with that required for listed entities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given both a senate committee and the Auditor-General have identified issues with the reporting of remuneration by Commonwealth entities, there appears to be merit in considering whether the disclosure requirements can be enhanced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this regard, I draw the Senate's attention to NBN Co, another wholly government-owned business enterprise, which publishes detailed information about the remuneration paid to individual senior executives as part of its annual report. When examining NBN Co, senators do not need to spend time seeking basic facts about the remuneration of its executives. Australia Post's management should follow NBN Co's example and be up-front with the parliament and the Australian people about the remuneration they receive. It is frustrating that the committee's time and resources have been spent pursuing a basic element of accountability. However, I hope this episode serves as a timely reminder to Australia Post that it is accountable to the parliament and its committees for the use of the public resources with which it has been entrusted.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I introduce a Bill that will amend the Corporations Act. It will raise the education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers by requiring financial advisers to hold a degree, undertake a professional year, pass an exam, undertake continuous professional development and comply with a Code of Ethics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In introducing this Bill today, we are implementing our commitment set out in the Government's response to the Financial System Inquiry (FSI). With its introduction, we are also responding to recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC) on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into proposals to lift the professional, ethical and education standards in the financial services industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Government is committed to ensuring Australia has a financial services regulatory regime that enhances confidence and trust by fostering an environment in which financial firms treat customers fairly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Creating a holistic professional standards framework to raise the competency and professionalism of financial advisers is an important part of our commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Raising the professional standards of financial advisers will play a significant role in improving consumer trust in the financial advice industry, which has had repeated instances of inappropriate behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Reduced trust acts as a barrier to consumers seeking financial advice, which is an extremely poor outcome for both consumers and industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We probably shouldn't be surprised then, that right now only one in every five Australians seeks financial advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Appropriate financial advice can significantly improve people's financial wellbeing. That's why we simply must improve trust in the industry so that consumers can have confidence in the advice they're seeking – so they can have recourse to the kind of strategic advice, expertise and knowledge that most everyday people don't normally hold. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Equally important is the sustainable future of the financial advice industry, which is integral to our economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the proposed reforms follow important steps already taken by the Government to improve the transparency and accountability of financial advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have already established a register of financial advisers that allows consumers to verify the credentials of financial advisers and be confident that they are appropriately qualified and experienced. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are also progressing reforms to life insurance advice remuneration structures. These reforms are an important step in addressing concerns that remuneration incentives are affecting the quality of advice provided to consumers and encouraging the unnecessary turnover of policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has consulted extensively on the measures in this Bill, which build on the model proposed by the PJC on Corporations and Financial Services, chaired by my colleague Senator David Fawcett, and the recommendations of the FSI. This is an excellent example of different segments of industry working together to build a workable model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I note that both the FSI and PJC reviews identified that the existing professional standards for financial advisers are too low and do not ensure that all financial advisers have the necessary skills to provide high-quality advice to consumers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reviews recognise that the current regulatory framework was not enough to build professionalism in the financial advice industry and has not encouraged this industry to take a greater lead in setting standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that the current framework lacks the incentives to encourage industry to go above and beyond the minimum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, under the current law, advisers can become qualified to provide financial advice after just four days of training, and there are no specific ongoing training requirements beyond that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is now widespread support among industry, consumer groups, the Government and Parliament to raise education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that the time is right. We must take advantage of this momentum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The establishment of the standards body will be the first important step on the road to professionalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this proposed legislation, we will establish a standards body, as a Commonwealth company limited guarantee, to set education standards, professional year and continuing professional development requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The body will also develop an exam and a comprehensive code of ethics for all financial advisers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Establishing the standards body as a Commonwealth company will balance the body's independence with industry and consumer engagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will also minimise the Government's footprint and allow for the possibility of easily transferring the standards body back to industry once trust and confidence in the sector is restored. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will have no direct control over the entity's day-to-day operations, but, should the body not comply with its obligations, the responsible Minister may give the body a written direction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such a direction would only occur in very exceptional circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will be responsible for all appointments to the board, which will comprise an independent chair, three industry representatives, three consumer representatives, an academic and an ethicist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Industry will have a key role in the proposed model and will be consulted extensively as the body sets standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is critical because industry must have a stake in the standards-making process if it is to truly professionalise and develop standards above the minimum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the reforms, financial advisers who provide personal advice to retail clients on more complex products will need to meet the new standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Financial advisers who are only authorised to provide general advice or personal advice on less complex financial products, such as general insurance, will not be required to comply with the new standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will continue to set education and training standards for advisers who are only authorised to provide general advice or advice on less complex products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">New financial advisers will require a degree, while existing advisers will need to meet a standard equivalent to a degree set by the standards body.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government announced on 1 May 2015 that it would provide more certainty and better outcomes for taxpayers and reduce the regulatory burden on them by providing the Commissioner with a Remedial Power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation laws are very complex. The nature and volume of taxation law can produce unforeseen and unintended outcomes in its application. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These outcomes can result in taxpayers generating tax liabilities where this was not intended, or taxpayers being subject to record keeping or other compliance requirements that were not intended or are no longer necessary. These outcomes can create significant uncertainty and compliance costs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner endeavours to interpret the law to give effect to its purpose or object, but instances remain where this is not possible. For example, this can occur when dealing with new scenarios, or scenarios which were not contemplated when the provisions were drafted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unintended outcomes may be addressed through changes to the primary law. However, law change is resource intensive and is undertaken to give effect to the full range of government priorities. It can therefore be ill-suited to resolving smaller unintended outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The challenge of effecting primary law change is illustrated by the 92 announced changes to the tax and superannuation law that had not been enacted at the time the Government was elected in September 2013. Had the Remedial Power existed, it may have been able to address some of the smaller unintended outcomes and could have allowed constrained legislative resources to deal with more significant primary law change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Remedial Power allows the Commissioner to make a disallowable legislative instrument to modify the operation of a taxation law to ensure the law can be administered to achieve its intended purpose or object. This will help to create flexibility, allowing the Commissioner to resolve smaller unintended outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The delegation of this power to the Commissioner must be subject to necessary checks and balances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, Parliament has oversight of all instruments made under this power. Instruments would not take effect until after the expiry of the parliamentary disallowance period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Safeguards are built into the Remedial Power itself. The power can only be used where:</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the modification is not inconsistent with the purpose or object of the provision;</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the Commissioner considers the modification to be reasonable, having regard to both the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision and whether the costs of complying with the provision are disproportionate to achieving the intended purpose or object; and</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed power is to be used as a power of last resort, when unintended consequences cannot be ameliorated by the Commissioner in any other way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the past, there have been instances where there has been a misalignment between the stated purpose of a particular provision and the technical language adopted in the legislation. In these instances the Commissioner has not been able to address these issues or administer the legislation in a way that gives effect to its intended object or purpose. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure provides an avenue for efficient resolution of these issues, as and when they arise and fits well with the existing commitment by the Commissioner to administer taxation legislation in accordance with the stated policy intent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measure will allow a smooth administration of the taxation and superannuation laws, in particular, when dealing with smaller unintended or unforeseen outcomes. This measure will assist in cutting red-tape and provide greater support for taxpayers across Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, Schedule 2 amends the law so that farmers can re‑access the benefits of tax averaging ten income years after they decided to opt out of the system for year to year smoothing of primary production income taxation. This change is necessary to ensure the rules do not continue to permanently and unnecessarily exclude eligible farmers from the benefits of income averaging. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, a farmer who chooses to opt out of income averaging can never re-access the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Farmers' income is often volatile due to factors outside of their control, such as drought and fluctuating commodity prices. The averaging rules even out a farmer's income tax liability from year to year, so that they pay fairer amounts of tax in relation to taxpayers on comparable but steadier incomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government heard from stakeholders in consultation that the current averaging rules are inflexible and do not make sufficient allowance for changing business circumstances. A farmer choosing to opt out of income averaging may later realise that this choice was no longer appropriate for their circumstances. For example, they may not have anticipated future income volatility, acted on the basis of poor advice, or assumed they would experience many years of declining income. Currently, these farmers can never re-access the concession, even where they remain in primary production and face volatilities from market conditions and natural disasters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While it makes sense to have rules that prevent farmers from opting in and out of income averaging simply to gain tax benefits, a permanent exclusion is longer than necessary to prevent possible abuse of the concession. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over the past four decades, the value of agricultural output has been almost two and a half times more volatile than the average for all the major sectors of the Australian economy. Australian farmers also experience greater volatility in yield and price than most other farmers in the world. The Government recognises the need for Australia's tax system to account for the agriculture sector's operating environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This schedule will benefit farmers as averaging will only recommence when they are eligible for a tax offset. A farmer may always choose to opt out again if it does not suit their circumstances to remain in income averaging. Their choice will be effective for another ten income years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This change was announced in the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper on 4 July 2015, and is the product of extensive stakeholder feedback and consultation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 3 amends the luxury car tax to provide tax relief to certain public institutions that import or acquire cars for the sole purpose of public display.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, if a public museum or art gallery imports a car for display and it is over the $63,184 threshold, the museum or gallery will have to pay luxury car tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill implements the 2015-16 Budget measure allowing public museums and public art galleries that have been endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation as a deductible gift recipient to acquire cars free of luxury car tax. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Relief from luxury car tax will only be available for cars acquired solely for the purpose of public display. The cars must be exhibited or shown in an environment that is accessible to the general community, for example, display in a museum that is open to the general public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, Schedule 4 makes a number of amendments to tax and superannuation laws to provide certainty for taxpayers. These amendments make sure that the law operates as intended by correcting technical or drafting defects, removing anomalies, and addressing unintended outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This furthers the Government's commitment to restore simplicity and fairness to the Australian tax system, and to the care and maintenance of the law. By clarifying the law and repealing unnecessary provisions, these amendments also reduce the regulatory burden and make it easier for Australians to access current law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments include:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">updating the specific listings of deductible gift recipients to reflect name changes as advised by the listed organisations, which ensures these entities continue to attract public financial support for their activities; and</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following that review, the Australian Privacy Commissioner established a voluntary data breach notification scheme based on the principles the ALRC recommended, and published guidance material about appropriate data breach notification practices.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The voluntary scheme received 107 notifications in 2015‑16, which is 245% higher than the 44 notifications received in 2009‑10.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill draws on the ALRC's recommendation and practical experience gained from the Commissioner's voluntary scheme and associated guidance material. It is also expected that the Commissioner would issue guidance material under the mandatory scheme to assist entities to comply.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill has also been subject to extensive consultation before introduction to ensure that the proposed scheme provides effective privacy protections for Australians without placing an unreasonable regulatory burden on industry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Exposure draft legislation and explanatory material was released for public consultation between 3 December 2015 and 4 March 2016. Forty-seven public submissions were received on the exposure draft, most supportive of the proposal or supportive subject to particular technical changes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Attorney-General's Department also held discussions with a broad range of industry and civil society stakeholders during the consultation period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considered all stakeholder contributions made during the consultation.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Privacy Act currently requires most Australian Government agencies, private sector organisations with annual turnover of more than $3 million, and specific kinds of smaller organisations (such as health service providers) to take reasonable steps to protect personal information they hold. Equivalent requirements also apply to specific other kinds of information, such as tax file number information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill's mandatory data breach notification scheme applies to all entities who are subject to these existing requirements and experience an 'eligible data breach'. An eligible data breach is 'notifiable', as per the Bill's title, where it satisfies conditions specified in the Bill and no exceptions to notification apply. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An eligible data breach, in short, is where there is unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure or loss of personal information that a reasonable person would conclude is likely to result in serious harm to individuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Experiencing an eligible data breach under the Bill will not necessarily mean that the entity concerned has breached the existing Privacy Act information security requirements. For example, it is possible that, despite having taken reasonable steps to secure personal information it holds, an entity may nonetheless experience a data breach due to human error or other circumstances that are not reasonably foreseeable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where an entity has reason to suspect that an eligible data breach may have occurred, the entity is required to undertake a reasonable and expeditious assessment of the circumstances. If an entity has reasonable grounds to believe they have experienced an eligible data breach, after an assessment or otherwise, the entity must notify the Information Commissioner and affected individuals. The entity has flexibility to notify affected individuals directly, or if that is not practicable, to publish an online notice about the eligible data breach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Entities are required to undertake notification in these forms unless an exception applies. These exceptions are designed to balance privacy protections of individuals with other matters in the public interest, such as avoiding prejudicing activities of law enforcement agencies or disclosing information where that disclosure would be inconsistent with a secrecy provision in another law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An exception will also apply where an entity can determine with a high degree of confidence that it has taken action to remediate the harm arising from an eligible data breach before that harm has occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, entities can apply to the Information Commissioner for an exception from the notification requirement, either altogether or for a specific period of time. The Commissioner has an additional power to direct an entity to notify an eligible data breach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The mandatory data breach notification scheme in the Bill is connected to the existing enforcement framework under the Privacy Act. This means that the Information Commissioner's existing investigatory powers will apply in the event that an entity breaches a requirement of the Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will ensure that the Commissioner can investigate possible non-compliance with the mandatory data breach notification scheme, and potentially make a determination requiring the entity to remedy such non‑compliance. In the case of serious or repeated non‑compliance, the Commissioner can also apply to a court to impose a civil penalty.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a government, we are focusing on the policies that will boost investor confidence, drive productivity gains in our economy, particularly through innovation, and open up new markets through our successful and ambitious trade agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill being introduced today is an important part of this forward-looking agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Act 2001</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001</span> to facilitate crowd‑sourced equity funding in Australia, and implements the commitment made by the Government in the 2015-16 Budget as part of our Growing Jobs and Small Business package. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Crowd-sourced equity funding is a truly innovative concept. It allows businesses to obtain capital from a large number of investors through an online platform, where each investor typically contributes a small amount of money in return for an equity stake in the business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2014, the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee completed a review into the crowd-sourced equity funding landscape in Australia. It found this form of fundraising is costly and impractical for businesses, largely due to regulatory impediments in the Corporations Act that imposed an excessive compliance cost for start-ups and other small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the detailed recommendations put forward by the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee. This Bill responds to these recommendations by establishing a legislative framework for crowd-sourced equity funding that addresses the regulatory impediments identified in the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee's report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The framework the Government is introducing will enable public companies to issue equity through crowdsourcing with reduced disclosure compared to what is required under a full public equity fundraising. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For newly registered or converted public companies that meet the assets and turnover tests, the framework provides concessions from some corporate governance and reporting obligations. To ensure investors are able to make informed investment decisions and not exposed to excessive potential losses, the framework sets out the minimum disclosure requirements and a $10,000 per issuer per 12-month period investor cap for retail investors. It also sets out a number of obligations that intermediaries will need to perform as part of providing a crowdfunding service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not the Government's role to pick winners, but it is the Government's responsibility to create the right economic conditions for small businesses and start-ups to grow and thrive and take steps to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers. The framework set out in this Bill will enable Australia's innovative early-stage businesses to obtain the capital they need to turn good ideas into commercial successes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Crowd-sourced equity funding will offer a new funding option for small businesses. It complements other forms of crowdfunding already available, such as rewards-based crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, to offer start-ups greater choice in how they fund and finance their operations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will serve as both a complement and a source of competition to more traditional funding options for small businesses, including bank debt products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has consulted extensively on the design of the proposed crowd-sourced equity funding framework. The model detailed in this Bill strikes the right balance between supporting investment, reducing compliance costs and maintaining an appropriate level of investor protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2014, the Government released a discussion paper that raised options for a potential crowd-sourced equity funding model for Australia. The Government consulted on this over early 2015, including through two industry roundtables. Over forty submissions were received as part of this process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also took into consideration the recommendations of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee review, including specific requirements for businesses, intermediaries and investors. International experience was also taken into account, in particular the framework in New Zealand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The consultation process indicated broad stakeholder support for a regulatory framework for crowd-sourced equity funding. Many stakeholders also recommended adoption of a framework quickly, noting that delays would risk impeding the development of the crowdfunding market in Australia. A number of crowdfunding platform operators also indicated interest in becoming licensed to provide platform services in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In August 2015, the Government released an outline of its proposed framework for public companies, reflecting many of the key aspects of New Zealand's approach, such as licensing and other gatekeeper obligations for intermediaries, reduced disclosure for companies raising funds, and a liberal approach to retail investor caps along with investor protections such as risk warnings for investors. Following a four week consultation period, over fifty submissions were received. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government undertook targeted consultation on the draft legislation prior to its introduction into Parliament, making a number of improvements to the draft legislation on the basis of this feedback. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also consulted with State and Territory governments, which have agreed to these amendments to the Corporations Act and consequential amendments to the ASIC Act, in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Agreement</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">2002</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to thank all of the stakeholders who participated in these consultations over the past two years. It is important that the regulatory framework for crowd-sourced equity funding operates effectively in order to maximise the benefit to businesses, intermediaries and investors. Stakeholder feedback has assisted with development of a framework that achieves this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would now like to turn to the provisions of this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 to this Bill inserts a new Part into Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act. This sets out the various elements that comprise the crowd-sourced equity funding framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's crowd-sourced equity funding regime will allow eligible companies to fundraise up to $5 million per year from the crowd. The ability to raise such amounts will enable entrepreneurs of innovative early-stage businesses in Australia to obtain the capital they need to turn good ideas into commercial successes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure the regime is appropriately targeted, companies will be required to meet turnover and assets tests before they are eligible to fundraise under this Part. The threshold is set at $25 million. This will enable a broad range of companies to make use of crowd-sourced equity funding and provide investors with a wider range of investment opportunities. As the market develops, the ongoing appropriateness of these thresholds can be reviewed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the framework, public companies will be eligible to use crowd-sourced equity funding. Following a consultation paper on proprietary company funding options released in 2015, the Government is continuing to consult on extending the regime to proprietary companies, which are generally prohibited from offering shares to the general public. I have instructed Treasury to continue developing a framework for proprietary companies as a priority and would expect that an extension of the framework will be introduced through subsequent legislation in the near future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the meantime, this Bill provides proprietary companies that wish to raise funds from the crowd access to the option to convert to a public company and receive exemptions from some of the more costly governance and reporting requirements for up to five years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For small business people, time spent on regulatory compliance is time not spent working to ensure the success of their business. Businesses wishing to access crowd‑sourced equity funding must at this stage be public companies. However, the Government is conscious that the demands involved in transitioning to a public company structure, and complying with the corporate governance and reporting obligations, can be onerous, particularly for the amount of funds that an early-stage business would typically seek. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 to this Bill sets out a number of concessions for newly registered or converted public companies that have restructured in order to access crowd-sourced equity funding. Provided a company undertakes crowd-sourced equity fundraising within 12 months of registering as a public company, it is eligible for exemptions of up to five years from requirements to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">hold an annual general meeting;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">have annual reports audited if it has raised less than $1 million from crowd-sourced equity funding; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">provide its annual reports to investors, other than by publishing it on its website. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, companies fundraising under this framework will be able to offer equity securities to retail investors with lower disclosure than currently required. This will improve access to crowd sourced equity funding for small businesses and start‑ups as a full disclosure document can be costly and time consuming to prepare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that reducing disclosure may also diminish investors' confidence about their capacity to make informed decisions about an offer. The Government proposes to set out disclosure requirements in the regulations that will ensure that investors have access to the key facts about the company, its structure and the fundraising. Investors will also be able to interact directly with the company to ask questions relating to an offer and the company will be able to respond to any questions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has listened to stakeholders on how to best balance the fundraising needs of businesses and investor protection. The framework in this Bill permits retail investors to invest up to $10,000 per issuer per 12-month period, allowing investors the opportunity to make substantial investments in a product, while also seeking to mitigate the size of their exposure. This Bill also provides a regulation-making power to amend this amount as the market develops. Retail investors will not be limited in the total amount of investment in crowd‑sourced equity funding they can undertake, allowing them to diversify their investments. Investors will also be protected in the form of cooling off rights for a period of 48 hours after making an investment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The final element of this Bill I would like to highlight is the importance of intermediaries to the operation of an equity crowdfunding market. As a gatekeeper, intermediaries provide an important quality assurance role, and in recognition of this intermediaries will be required to hold an Australian Financial Services Licence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Requiring intermediaries to be licenced provides issuers and investors alike with confidence in the integrity of the intermediary and their capacity to carry out the obligations of operating a crowd-sourced equity funding platform. The framework sets out certain obligations that intermediaries will need to perform, including the requirement to conduct checks on issuers before listing their offer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ongoing responsibility for issuing licenses and monitoring the operation of the framework set out in this Bill will sit with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. To support this, ASIC was provided with $7.8 million in funding through the 2015-16 Budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also makes amendments to Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act, to ensure the Australian Market Licensing regime can, in the future, be tailored to intermediaries operating crowd‑sourced funding platforms. Schedule 3 to this Bill provides the Minister with the power to exempt certain market operators, including intermediaries, from specific obligations under the Australian Market Licensing regime. This will enable the Government to further reduce the compliance burden for operators of emerging and specialised markets, such as the crowdfunding market, as it matures. These amendments commence on the date this Bill receives Royal Assent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum. The Government proposes to make regulations to support the operation of the measures in this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The crowd-sourced equity funding framework will take effect six months from the date the Bill receives Royal Assent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This package will help foster innovative economic activity, unlocking new sources of funding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Introducing this Bill today delivers on the Government's Budget commitment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It also delivers on the Government's commitment to back small and start-up businesses to help the Australian economy transition from the mining and investment boom to a more resilient and diversified economy that delivers jobs and growth to all Australians. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no clearer example of the overwhelming rejection of these cuts than the fact the government have announced they will be dropping them before this place even gets to vote on the motion before us today. That is right: they knew that this place would strike out the cuts to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule which took effect on January 1 this year. Backed into a corner, they announced they would drop the cut and restore funding per child to the original level of support. Make no mistake, the government did not do this because it was the right thing to do or because they wanted to; they did this because they were forced to. Though they had indicated they will drop the cuts, we are yet to see this legislative change. So not only are we proceeding with this motion, we are asking the government to vote for it as a sign of good faith. If they are serious about dropping this cut which will leave 250,000 children worse off then they should vote for this motion today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there has been cross-party support for this motion to disallow the government's cuts to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule, and I thank my fellow senators for their cooperation. We united against the government's attempt to cut the Child Dental Benefits Schedule for a simple reason: they have always been unfair cuts that, at the government's own estimates, left one in four children who used the scheme worse off. The Prime Minister has done nothing but attack successful and established dental programs for both children and adults. Malcolm Turnbull originally planned to abolish the scheme completely, only backflipping after Labor fought to have the cut removed from their omnibus legislation last year. Their latest cuts were yet another attack on the successful program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To understand why protecting this program has been so vital, it is important to look at why it was established in the first place. Firstly, it is important to recognise that dental care is not just about teeth. Poor dental health is linked to chronic disease. If teeth are not properly cared for, it often leads to much greater health problems. People often think that in children oral health is not as important because baby teeth will be replaced. This could not be more false. The primary teeth play a particularly important role in in a child's development, aiding in speech development and nutrition. In addition, untreated dental pain can impact on a child's ability to pay attention and learn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the former Labor government took steps to advance our universal system of health care to dental care with the announcement of a dental reform package, the centrepiece of which was the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Labor introduced this scheme because of disturbing evidence that the oral health of children has been declining since the mid-1990s. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2009, the proportion of children who had experienced decay in their baby teeth ranged from 42 per cent for five-year-olds to 61 per cent for nine-year-olds. The proportion of children with permanent teeth affected by decay ranged from five per cent for six-year-olds to 58 per cent for 14-year-olds. Almost 20,000 kids under the age of 10 are hospitalised each year due to avoidable dental issues. By age 15, six out of 10 kids have tooth decay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme sought to tackle that by providing a capped benefit of $1,000 per child over a two-calendar-year period, targeted at low-income and middle-income families by tying eligibility to those receiving family tax benefit part A or an equivalent Australian government payment. This program was a crucial investment in the long-term health of children because we know that dental health in children is the best predictor for dental health as adults, but also a predictor of overall health. It is a tightly targeted program to ensure that the kids and families who most need help accessing dental services are the ones who get it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Liberals have been determined to axe the scheme ever since they came to government. First, they refused to promote the scheme, leaving many parents unaware of the important dental services that their children could access. In fact, a review by this government's own health department said that the scheme's only failing was the Abbott-Turnbull government's refusal to promote it. In a review of the program, the health department said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, the Panel noted the success of the CDBS in targeting the oral health of young Australians at an age where preventative measures can be most effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health department made several recommendations to improve awareness of the scheme, which this government has never implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in April last year, the government announced its plan to abolish the Child Dental Benefits Scheme. Parents, dentists and experts were outraged, and Labor was proud to stand with them in the fight for the scheme. When they could not pass through the Senate their plan to abolish the scheme, the government instead applied a cut across the board, cutting the entitlement of every child who was eligible under the program. On New Year's Day, the government cut the cap on CDBS benefits from $1,000 over two years to $700. That is a cut of up to $300 a child, or $600 for a family with two kids. Late last year, the former health minister admitted that the new cap would hurt more than one in four of the children who use the scheme. That is over a quarter of a million kids who would have been worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To understand how nonsensical the decision to cut the scheme was, the government need only have spoken to any dentist. The opposition visited countless dental practices, who reiterated how important the scheme was. In practice after practice dentists said they were seeing kids from families who never before had come to see a dentist, and, as a result of this government's attacks on the Child Dental Benefits Scheme, they feared that these kids would either never see a dentist, or would have to wait years if they were thrown back onto the endless waiting lists of the community dental schemes. Attempting to scrap a proven program to help children access affordable dental care was always in the running for one of the Prime Minister's cruellest cuts. It might have taken over a year, but Labor is pleased that the scheme has been protected and the government has finally dropped their cuts altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately though, this announcement does nothing to restore the massive $300 million-a-year cut to adult public dental services that will see 337,000 Australians lose access to dental services. When the government announced in December their latest cut to children's dental services, they also announced a paltry sum of money for adult dental services, after leaving the states and territories in limbo until the 11th hour. As a result of this government's cuts to adult public dental, disadvantaged and vulnerable Australians will lose access to life-changing dental services as a result of long waiting lists, and they will grow across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding allocated to the states and territories for public adult services is an insult when the Liberal government have ripped hundreds of millions of dollars out of adult public dental services since 2013. In government, Labor budgeted $391 million a year for the national partnership agreement on adult dental services. The Abbott/Turnbull governments have cut this time and time again. Also, the announcement last year of a further cut means the Liberals are ripping $300 million out of public dental services every year. As a result, every year around 337,000 Australians will miss out on critical public dental services. The states themselves said what an insult the funding that was allocated was. The Queensland health minister said that it was a 75 per cent cut to federal dental funding for Queensland on what was promised in the Member for Warringah's first slash and burn budget, in 2014-15. So there are still serious unresolved questions about the future of adult public dental services funding, and the impact on waiting lists, that this government needs to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at today's confirmation, it is both a victory for children's dental health and an embarrassing backflip for this government. Let us remember that it has been only about a month since these cuts took effect on January 1. They kicked off the new year by slashing the amount of dental assistance eligible children could receive under the scheme by $300 a child. They pursued these cuts despite admitting that one in four children who use the scheme would be negatively impacted, leaving a quarter of a million children worse off. What a lousy New Year's present indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might be asking what has happened to make the government change its mind in such a short amount of time. Why the sudden backflip?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer is in this place. They knew that today we would vote and throw out their cuts. So, backed into a corner, they scrambled to claim back some credibility. If those on the other side have seriously had a change of heart about this cut, they should vote for this motion and throw out their own decision. Labor has never given up fighting for this program against Malcolm Turnbull's cuts, and we are pleased to have been able to protect it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I also stand to support the disallowance of the government's cuts to funding for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Let me begin by outlining the problem that we have here. Australia is a very wealthy nation, but we have young people, and people right across the board, who are suffering from very poor oral health. When you look at Australia's level of wealth, you see a disproportionately high number of people who suffer from poor oral health—dental disease and so on. Often people assume that having the odd cavity and having problems with dentures and so on is a minor issue, that it is not as important as other health burdens, but increasingly we are starting to understand just how critical it is to have very good oral health. Apart from the obvious things like infections and pain that poor oral health can sometimes cause, and apart from the issues associated with cavities that can be resolved through fillings and so on, having poor oral health has a very significant impact on people's general health and wellbeing. We are learning now that poor oral health is linked to heart disease and to stroke—a whole range of cardiovascular illnesses are a direct consequence of suffering from poor oral health. Indeed, it is associated with adverse outcomes for women who are pregnant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very serious problem, and it is not just a matter of the direct health impacts. It has a huge impact on people's wellbeing more generally. If you are missing teeth and do not have dentures, it can be highly stigmatising. If you are sitting there in a job interview, for example, it is automatically a marker that puts you behind the eight ball—likewise if you are looking for a rental property. Having very poor oral health compromises your ability in all these sorts of areas. So it has very serious impacts, both directly through the pain caused by infections and the very serious health impacts of diseases like cardiovascular disease but also through the impact on people's self-esteem—their ability to achieve things in life more generally. It can be highly stigmatising, and people with poor oral health will often find that they do not go out in public because they are worried about what people might think of them. As a GP, I would often see people coming in as a result of a tooth abscess or something similar. They could not afford to go and see dentists, so they would come in knowing they would get Medicare funded treatment. But as a doctor there is not much you can do. You would often give some antibiotics and maybe some pain relief, but what they really needed was specialist dental care. One of the big problems in this country is that for too many people dental care is unaffordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is the problem. In terms of Australia's approach to dental care, one of the great tragedies, in my view, was that oral health and dental care were excluded from Medicare when Medicare was constructed in the 1970s. We decided for some obscure reason, and people will argue about the history of this, that we would somehow treat the mouth as separate from the rest of the body. So if you have an infection on your forehead, for example, you will get Medicare funded medical care but if you have an infection in your gum or your tooth you will not get Medicare funded dental care; you have to predominantly pay for that dental care out of your own pocket. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the solution to all of that? If we were designing the system again, the Greens would have Medicare funded dental care. We would do what the Child Dental Benefits Schedule attempts to do. There is a bit of history here that is worth reflecting on. The Child Dental Benefits Schedule is effectively Medicare funded dental care for children. If you are a kid and you want to go and see a private dentist, you have $1,000 to spend over two years that can be basically funded through Medicare. If you present your Medicare card the dentist will provide up to $1,000 of treatment. So, it is Medicare funded dental care. I am very proud of it, because it was one of the outcomes of the power-sharing government involving the Labor Party, the Greens and the Independents. It is one of the outcomes that we achieved through that period of government—and that period of government is starting to look better every day, when you reflect back on that period and then look at what we are seeing at the moment. It is starting to look more like a golden age of stable government. The Child Dental Benefits Schedule was one of the agreements that we struck with Labor. It was something we put to them and we made it really clear that we wanted to see the start of Medicare funded dental care in this country, and, to the Labor Party's credit, they agreed with the proposal and we now have Medicare funded dental care for 80 per cent of kids. It is the only Medicare funded dental program in Australia. Basically, if you have access to family tax benefit part A—which the families of roughly 80 per cent of kids do—you get $1,000 worth of essential and preventative dental treatment over the two years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, this allows kids to go to private dentists. We know that 80 per cent of the dental workforce comprises private dentists. Families can access the scheme through the dentist of their choice. It allows you to have a relationship with your local dentist and also, importantly, allows you to avoid those huge waiting lists in the public dental system, which I will get to in a moment. It is really important for those people in regional communities. If you live out bush, waiting lists make access to public dental services nearly impossible. People in regional communities who otherwise would have had to travel for hundreds of kilometres to go to a public dental clinic are able to go and see their private dentist for their children's treatment. All in all, it was a really significant win. If the Greens were in government, we would make sure we expanded it. We would expand it so that we would have Medicare funded dental care for all people. That is what we took to the 2016 election campaign. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the 2016 election campaign, we took a plan to build on the CDBS—or what I think should be called 'Medicare funded dental care for kids'. We would bring in people from disadvantaged backgrounds. And there are ways of doing that—through concessional status and so on, people who have got health care cards—but ultimately we would like to see a universal dental health care system funded through Medicare. The same way you go to your GP, you could go and see your dentist. That is our long-term plan, and that was the plan we took to the election campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, what we have seen is a government that is ideologically opposed—and this is really important; I think this is a ideological attack. It makes no sense on the basis of evidence. This is a good long-term investment. Having people maintain good oral health is good, as I said earlier, for their sense of self-esteem, but it is also good in terms of productivity. Billions of dollars are lost in productivity because of people who have poor oral hygiene. We would go some way into improving the health debate in this country if we recognised that these preventative interventions actually have a long-term pay-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we saw was the government moving to cut the funding to the CDBS, or Medicare funded dental care for kids, by $300 per child through this regulation. That was basically one-third of the $1,000 that was taken off. It is a direct attack on those kids in regional communities and those people who are unable to access a private dentist because they simply cannot afford the up-front cost or they do not have private health insurance. It was really an attack on those people. I now understand, from a press release from the minister, that they have effectively read the writing on the wall—one of those rare moments of self-awareness from this government—and they are planning to restore the funding back to the $1,000 per child and to restore the scheme as it was originally designed by the Greens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the minister has been under some pressure from stakeholders. It is good that the new health minister has listened, and I commend him for that. I would also like to congratulate those stakeholders within the dental community who have put the case to the minister and indeed made their views very clear on this. So, given the minister's announcement, I assume that he will support this disallowance motion—given that he has said he will restore that $1,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say, it is very clear that the government has been keen to scrap the Medicare funded dental scheme all along. One of the more disgraceful chapters in this saga was when the government on multiple occasions released fact sheets and sent out information to families and to dentists saying they would no longer be able to receive dental care for their children under the scheme because they had a plan sometime in the future to get rid of it, despite never having the agreement of the Senate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So on one hand they are saying one of the issues with the scheme is that it is underutilised; and then on the other hand they are telling people they cannot utilise it because they are going to scrap it. What do you expect? They have undermined it at every turn. They have consistently fought to scrap this scheme. They have done nothing to promote it. In fact they have done the opposite. They have provided misleading information to the community to say the scheme will no longer be funded and therefore you will no longer be eligible. At Senate estimates time and time again we have caught the department out with false and misleading information being sent to individuals. Each time they corrected it, and then they returned to their dark old ways of providing people with misleading information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that, while we are pleased that the government has finally listened—and certainly the new health minister appears to have listened—and while this is an important scheme for children, and 80 per cent of kids have now got access to dental care through a private dental provider funded through Medicare, one of the real concerns here is what this government has done when it comes to funding for public dental health care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those people who do not know, the states and Commonwealth jointly fund public dental health clinics. There are many of them around the country, and they are very important because adults who cannot access this Medicare funded scheme, who cannot afford to pay the up-front cost to go and see a dentist, at least have the comfort of knowing that there is a public dental scheme waiting for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other significant achievements through that period of power sharing government was that we got a massive injection in funding into the public dental scheme. We had a significant injection, which brought down waiting lists, which in some places are up to three years. We have people who are waiting for dentures, who cannot afford to pay for them out of their own pocket, who have to wait for three years on a public dental scheme to be able to get dentures so they can just have a quality of life that most of us take for granted. Just reflect on that. We are not talking about cosmetic dental care here. We are talking about people who have chronic abscesses; some of them simply do not have any teeth and are waiting for dentures, and waiting for years. We went some way to addressing that through working with the Labor Party and Independents to ensure that we got a big injection into the public dental system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have this government done? They have ruthlessly attacked public dental services. In the 2013-14 budget they promised $391 million for 2016-17 public dental services. How much are we seeing now? $107 million per year. So last year the amount was reduced to about $155 million per year, from that $391 million that  was promised. Now they have cut it again and they are saying it is $320 million over three years. That is one-third of what was promised in the 2013-14 budget. They have slashed funding for public dental care. Of all the things, all the priorities, all of the areas where we could make savings—and I could list a huge number of those areas ripe for savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to decide in this country whether we are going to try and balance the budget on the back of this nation's most vulnerable people, some of the poorest people here, or whether we recognise there is a huge and growing gap between the super-rich and ordinary people and start to recognise what our priorities are. Let's talk about the diesel fuel rebate that goes to the mining industry worth billions of dollars. Let's stop propping up investment in the housing market by subsidising people who want to buy their third, fourth or fifth home.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are the sort of areas where we can make changes. How about a levy on the big banks to ensure that they pay for the guarantee that they get from government, rather than trying to squeeze a few million dollars out of health budgets, attacking vulnerable pensioners and doing what we saw in today's changes to family tax benefits, where the government is saying that the only way we are going to be able to help families is by hurting them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some choices to make in this country. We have to decide whether we as a nation want to ensure that we have a more equal, more caring society. That means cracking down on multinational tax avoidance and ending the rorts that exist in the property market that inflate home prices for young people, who are being screwed at the moment, and see them continue to be left out of the property market and basically denied an opportunity to own their own home. They are the sort of measures that we as a nation could take, rather than what this government is proposing to do, which is to cut essential services that I think are the foundation of a decent society.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that the government has seen the light today on the Medicare-funded dental scheme for kids, the CDBS. We are pleased about that. What we would like to see is a move to restore funding for public dental care. As I said, the Greens have said now for many, many years that we think the mouth should be considered like the rest of the body. Going to the dentist should be just like going to the doctor: produce your Medicare card, which is effectively a universal health insurance scheme that means we all get access to decent health care, which includes decent dental care.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate is rejecting this cut to the CDBS. As Greens, we will continue to fight not just to protect this scheme but to build it up; to make sure it is available not just to children but indeed, one day, to all Australians. We will challenge this government to restore that funding to public dental health care and to start balancing the budget by ensuring that we tackle that big and growing gap between the rich and ordinary people in this country. There are so many areas where we could make savings, where we could ensure that we have a sustainable budget position. You do not do it by balancing the budget on the back of this country's poorest and most vulnerable people.</span>

Under the scheme, on average only $312 of the rebate has been claimed per child per year. In light of this, the government has previously set the cap at $700 per child over a two-year period, which would still allow children to visit a dentist regularly. However, following consultation with the Australian Dental Association, the Minister for Health has decided to reinstate the cap at $1,000. We are also providing $11 million over two years to the Royal Flying Doctor Service to delivered dental outreach services to rural and remote communities. The Turnbull government is delivering on its commitment to improve the dental health of all Australians through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and to contribute to better public dental services through a national partnership agreement with the states and territories.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I am pleased to be co-sponsoring this motion. Cutting health treatments for children and low-income families is definitely not good policy. Inevitably, it just leads to deferred health costs for the public health system. The money saved today would merely be spent many times over in the future to deal with escalating problems that may have been prevented through early intervention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not support cutting $300 per child from the Child Dental Benefits Schedule because it is short-sighted and, I feel, poorly considered. Ensuring that children have healthy teeth helps set them up for a healthier adulthood. We know that poor dental health is linked to bigger health problems, such as heart disease, so moves to scale back dental services should not be taken lightly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CDBS scheme has been in operation since January 2014 and provides basic dental services such as cleaning, fillings, X-rays and root canals to eligible children aged between two and 17. The government had originally proposed scrapping the scheme and creating a new one that combined funding for both adults and children; however, several states rejected the proposal over concerns that they were being short-changed and thousands of people would miss out on treatment. In December the government instead announced a modified Child Dental Benefits Schedule that cut the scheme's cap from $1,000 per child over two years to $700 per child, claiming that this reflected user patterns. This could not be further from the truth. Last financial year more than one million children accessed free dental treatment through the scheme. This was slightly more than the previous year, costing $312.7 million in benefits. The government has budgeted for 2.4 million children to use the service each year, representing a substantial saving on paper. Despite this, the government feels the need to rip money out of the scheme to the detriment of the children who do use it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chief Medical Officer's review of the scheme administration, released in March last year, suggested the government's target of 2.4 million users was optimistic, and that the poor uptake was probably because the program was poorly promoted. Families getting Family Tax Benefit Part A are only made aware of their entitlement through a single letter from Centrelink. The scheme's low profile is compounded by the fact that most services across Australia are delivered privately. The jurisdictions where it was delivered through public dental services enjoy very much greater utilisation of the scheme. For instance, in my home state of South Australia almost 40 per cent of eligible children took up free dental care, the highest rate of use in 2014, and the review noted that the South Australian Dental Service was particularly proactive in accessing the scheme. In New South Wales, where it is almost solely delivered privately, the uptake was closer to 30 per cent. Regardless, the fact that one million children a year use this free dental care is no small thing. Because the scheme is so highly targeted, the children who need it most do use it. The states with the highest degree of use also had the highest number of disadvantaged children. About one in 10 children who used it in 2015 went over the $700 limit proposed by the government in just one year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has not made a sound case for cutting the dental care subsidy. In fact, it has made no substantive case at all. For this reason we do not agree with this measure and we support the disallowance motion.</span>

It will make clear that importing ingredients and undertaking minor processes that merely change the form of appearance of imported goods, such as dicing or canning, are not sufficient to justify a 'made in' claim.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to see this legislation getting fine-tuned and coming forward. Also, I support what others have said, and what Senator Macdonald has said, about the seafood industry—in allowing them to be identified more clearly. I was on a Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee inquiry into fish labelling/seafood labelling in the Northern Territory. Seventy per cent of the seafood in Australia is imported. We need to go a step further to see that the people who are eating seafood, like all other foods, know exactly where it comes from. Of course, this also promotes the Australian consumption and jobs in Australia. It is well known throughout the world that, if it is grown in Australia and processed in Australia, then it is good, clean food from the best farmers in the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude my contribution in saying that I welcome the country-of-origin labelling. As my colleague Senator Nash knows, we nearly ran out of puff on this issue at some stage. I said to Senator Nash, 'I've been trying for 23 years to get this country-of-origin labelling. I'm giving up. I'm hitting my head against a brick wall. I'm sick of having a bruised forehead and going nowhere.' Thanks to former Prime Minister Abbott for his decision to proceed with this and to my colleagues in the coalition. The inquiry has been a long period of consultation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will no doubt be some fine-tuning required later on. These things are complicated. They may have a negative effect on some businesses, with paperwork and labelling and clarification. We can do that later. The most important thing is: 1 July 2018 is the day when everything must be finalised. The Australian people can learn to read the labels—the bar underneath the green triangle with the kangaroo in it—to see how much is actually grown in Australia. And, of course, they will know that the more that bar is filled up the better quality food they can consume with total confidence. One thing that we have in this country—along with many things that we are good at—is great farmers.</span>

It is an important part of the country-of-origin labelling reforms championed by the government. I will not labour many of the issues which have been raised. I am aware that some senators have raised issues about going further. Senator Xenophon has raised certain issues. There have been issues in relation to seafood. But I do not intend to delay the Senate too much at this point, except to say that I will consider further some of the comments that have been made. This is a bit of a work in progress. But let's nail this and go on to the next stage. I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I have a number of questions in respect of the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill and in relation to the second reading amendment which was just defeated. I outlined the basis of that amendment in my second reading contribution—in other words, that there be an administrative arrangement to determine whether labelling laws were being complied with. In particular, this matter was raised in the context of the inquiry into this bill. It seems to me that there ought to be an analysis and report on the benefit of an administrative mechanism which would give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on country-of-origin labelling claims. In my additional comments in the Senate committee's report into this bill, I made a recommendation that legislation ought to be introduced to this effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I respectfully put to the minister is that there is a real issue as to how the supply of inputs is determined to be Australian or not. In particular, Australian Made Campaign Limited, whilst it supported the removal of the 50 per cent cost test, noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… some concerns that it may result in adverse consequences for some Australian suppliers of inputs. This will occur where a manufacturer opts to source cheaper inputs offshore, knowing that it will not affect their capacity to make a Made in Australia claim. An example of this is a manufacturer of soft gel capsules who currently purchases gelatin from an Australian manufacturer because it assists them to meet the 50% threshold. The local packaging industry may also be impacted adversely by this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AMCL raised concerns that there was currently no mechanism by which manufacturers could obtain a definitive answer regarding country-of-origin claims, and this could result in companies being hesitant to make a claim for fear that competitors would challenge its validity. That is contained in the committee report. So that is a particular issue that I would be grateful if the minister could address. Australian Made Campaign Limited is well known and it made a very cogent submission, and there does not appear to be any administrative mechanism to deal with the concerns made by Australian Made Campaign Limited.</span>

We have revised the safe harbour provisions to clarify and simplify the rules for making claims about where goods are made and to expand the resources available to business. The ACCC will be releasing improved guidance material on country-of-origin labelling under Australian Consumer Law and on its approach to enforcement. We have also developed an online decision tool which assists food businesses to identify and download appropriate labels for their products under the new country-of-origin labelling information standard. The changes proposed by the government have been informed by extensive consultation and by a regulation impact statement. Under an intergovernmental agreement, all these proposals for change must be agreed by the Commonwealth and all states and territories—it is a bit like the GST. The Commonwealth cannot make changes to Australian Consumer Law without going through that lengthy process again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, it is important to note that the new arrangements put forward in this bill and the new information standard will be reviewed two years after the end of the transition period. This will provide the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of these reforms in meeting their objectives. Certainly on behalf of the government I am willing to give you undertakings in relation to this review. Obviously we want to monitor this and make it successful. The fact that parties on all sides think that this is a good way to go and that this is a good start is very encouraging to me. I do not believe, at this stage, that we have adequately looked at the costs and benefits of what Senator Xenophon has proposed, but I believe we are giving assistance to industry. Proper guidance in relation to safe harbours, as well as additional resources, should provide some comfort for them as they go through this process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have looked at the labelling. I think it looks good and I think it is much easier to understand. We are talking here about substantial transformation; we are not talking about slicing and dicing and making some change in the canning. We are putting a lot of resources, including an advertising campaign, into informing consumers and businesses about how this is going to operate.</span>

The minister did make reference to some of the matters. Could he give some particularity on the types of resources that would be employed here and on whether the guidance tools—the online mechanisms that he referred to—would have any administrative force or give any protection to manufacturers? It would be short of an administrative mechanism or a natural determination as such—it seems to be a web tool that would give some guidance. What would happen if a manufacturer goes online, ticks all the boxes and it comes up as saying that they have reached this threshold, but then they are involved in a legal dispute, perhaps even with the ACCC? What protection do they have from that?</span>

Given that you say the previous regime, the 51 per cent, does not include slicing and dicing, can you give some detail to crystallise what the key differences are so that there is some greater meaning in terms of what Australian made actually means?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  In relation to the first question, I would have to say that the safe harbour defences are designed exactly for that purpose: to give confidence to companies that, if they are doing the right thing and they are putting the labels on in the right way, they are protected. It is important to understand that. In relation to the second question, the best I can do is refer you to some of the material that is being provided in relation to the various types of products, how they could be packaged and what that would mean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, in the case of ham, the critical ingredients in the brine mix required for curing the pork to form ham or similar products are not available in Australia and must be imported. So, as long as the ham is there, it can be 100 per cent Australian. If it is made in Australia from 96 per cent Australian pork and water with imported brine mix: 'Made or packed in Australia from at least 96 per cent Australian ingredients'. If it is made in Australia from imported pork and brine mix with Australian water accounting for 20 per cent of ongoing weight only: 'Made in Australia from at least 20 per cent ingredients'. If a ham is made in Denmark, imported into Australia and then sliced and packaged in blocks or slices for retail sale in Australia: 'Made in Denmark' or 'Made in Denmark, packed in Australia'. If a ham is made and packed in a single overseas country—for example, Canada—and then imported into Australia for retail sale: 'Made in Canada'. If the ham made in one overseas country—it could be Canada again—and is imported into and packed in another overseas country, for example, the USA, the above label can still be used or 'Made in Canada, packed in the United States of America'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making pork into ham is a substantial transformation, as the pork and ham are identified as fundamentally different products. Most brine mixes used to make ham combine critical ingredients—sugars, salts, nitrates, flavours—from different countries. The brine mix is added to local water to form a solution of varying strengths. The solution is then injected into the pork and left to cure for varying periods, turning it into ham. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole series of these examples—we can go through them—which will illustrate the proposition. But let me come back to the Australian Made Campaign, because I think that is an important point. In a case like that, I can engage directly with the Australian Made Campaign people and sort out the way forward in terms of the materials we are going to be providing and the use of the online decision tool. As I said before, there will be information campaigns and all the rest of it. There may be elements at the margin where a question may be raised, but if we are going to have a period of providing information we can work much of this out.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  I do want to go through some of these issues. I hope you do not find it tedious, but I think this is important. The Australian Made Campaign Limited raised a number of points. Their submission to the Senate inquiry states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While we support the changes embodied in the Bill overall, we have ongoing concerns about the lack of objectivity in the key criteria and the absence of definitions of key concepts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The submission further states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AMCL has previously expressed our concern that the terms 'significant ingredient' and 'significant component' continue to be undefined in the legislation. While the ACCC has in the past provided some guidance on the meaning of these terms, our experience has been that businesses continue to struggle with practical application of this test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">AMCL strongly recommends that the Bill provide greater clarity around these key concepts. For example, a 'significant ingredient' could be defined as any ingredient excluding preservatives, food processing aids, food colouring, etc. In the absence of a definition within the legislation, extensive guidance is required with examples from a range of industries.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister gave a helpful example about ham and brine—and he was making me hungry talking about it!—but I think it is important that we deal with the very reasonable request from the Australian Made Campaign Limited.</span>

Firstly, let me clarify that the ACCC is providing guidance. It is guidance that they are prepared to stand by—that is the important point. I have not interacted with the Australian Made Campaign. I am advised that they were consulted in arriving at examples. Sometimes you have to look at the glass as being half full rather than half empty. We may not get perfection today—</span>

                    </a>  Well, whether it was plastic or it was made from proper glass—sand and silica—we will see! The point is this: we can proceed on the basis that most people in this chamber believe is a fair basis on which to go forward. On the way, if issues arise, there is a two-year monitoring period. I do not believe that in that time substantial harm will be done to Australian industry if there has to be some sort of tweaking of the examples we are talking about or their interpretation. The ACCC is fully onside, and I am happy to interact further with the Australian Made Campaign on any outstanding concerns. As I said before, they were consulted in arriving at examples.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">AMCL's principal concern in this area is that both the current and the proposed definition of 'substantial transformation' are very far from providing a clear and objective criterion against which to assess claims. The phrase 'fundamentally different in identity, nature or essential character' is highly subjective and open to interpretation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AMCL argue for that simple administrative mechanism.  The minister says that there is a website and that there will be guidelines from the ACCC, but can the minister assure us that the claims that are made about Australian made, with the new substantial transformation test, will be robust? How do you resolve a dispute? If a manufacturer goes to the ACCC saying, 'We want to make this claim,' it is not the ACCC's job to make a determination for them. I do not think that is the way the ACCC operates unless they are able to in the context of this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  I thank the minister for his answer and the spirit in which he gave it. I just make the point that reasonable concerns were raised by the Australian Made Campaign Limited, and I do not think they have been addressed adequately. I accept what the minister says—let's give it a go. I think he could have been more rigorous. Before I move my amendment, I want to ask something of the minister. I think Senator Macdonald was going to sing his praises earlier on today, and I was happy for him to do so.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a long saga over seafood labelling. When you buy fresh seafood in supermarkets or at fishmongers, they tell you where it comes from. But in the context of food labelling, if you go to a seafood restaurant or your local takeaway fish and chip shop, even though it might be right next door to the supermarket, 10 metres away, it seems that magically the requirements for labelling disappear. Senators from all sides of the chamber in the last parliament supported reforms based on the Northern Territory reforms to give that information to consumers. This bill does not touch on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of labelling for cooked seafood, can the minister indicate, for the many millions of Australians who regularly enjoy their seafood in fish and chip shops, restaurants and takeaway shops, whether the government is planning to bring about reforms based broadly on the very successful Northern Territory laws? By the way, the evidence from the seafood industry is that many thousands of jobs would be created. I think there were 3,000 jobs in one sector alone. The prawn fishers say it would make a very big difference to their job numbers if we had this key reform in seafood labelling laws.</span>

The first is that I discovered when I inherited the portfolio that my assistant minister is a very capable person. There has been a working group set up to look at options around country-of-origin labelling for seafood, and he has written to key stakeholders seeking their views and further information in relation to consumer access to information for seafood sold in the food-service environment. That is being followed up, and stakeholders have been asked to respond by 9 March, and the working group will then review this information and consider the next steps.</span>

Yes, you mentioned what the Territory has done, and the Territory can be an exemplar on many things, I am sure. But we have worked this through with the Commonwealth and with the states. We have had extensive consultation and a regulation impact statement et cetera, so the new arrangements put forward in this bill and the new information standard are going to be reviewed two years after the end of the transition period. And this will be an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of these reforms in meeting their objectives.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, I have not had the opportunity as yet to meet with people like the Australian Made Campaign and get it directly from the horse's mouth or pick up whatever recommendations there may be from the assistant minister on seafood.</span>

I had discussions with Senator Nash and the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Barnaby Joyce, although I am not sure whether he was Deputy Prime Minister at the time that did not seem to go as far as I wanted. Can the minister indicate, as a matter of principle, what is his and his government's view? As a matter of principle, should Australian consumers who go to the supermarket and know where their seafood comes from also have that right and degree of information when they go into a fish and chip shop or a restaurant? Should they know at the very least whether it is local Australian seafood or imported?</span>

There is always a bit of a debate about how you provide that information. You can walk into a restaurant and, when you see barramundi on the menu, ask, 'Where is this barramundi from? Is it from the Territory? Is it from overseas?' If you see spaghetti marinara on the menu, you can say, 'Where are the prawns from?' You can do that. If you are telling me you do not necessarily trust what the waiter or the restaurateur will say and you want that somehow with the imprimatur of a third-party, all I can say is that my capable assistant minister is looking into these issues.</span>

Then we are on the exciting road of more and more information available to people through their labels.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is fairly straightforward one. One of the complaints made by the Australian Food and Grocery Council and others in the past about mandatory country-of-origin labelling laws is that there are costs involved. Once you label something, if the ingredients change because of seasonal variations or for whatever reason, it is very expensive to change labels. What this amendment seeks to do—a sort of belts and braces approach to the legislation that is before us—in addition to what this bill provides for is to go another step. It basically says that there must be notification online of reporting country of origin imported ingredients to ensure that, at the end of the reporting period—every six months—they must notify the secretary of the department of each ingredient of the food that is not exclusively of Australian origin and the country or countries of origin, and, if there is more than one country of origin of the ingredient during the reporting period, the average proportion by weight of the ingredient from each country of origin over the reporting period. This ensures that it is published online. It means that the information can be published in an easily accessible form and it does not have the burden that the industry has referred to of having to change labels, which can be very costly and, with production lines and the like, is itself quite time consuming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Effectively, this is using the internet for a purpose to empower consumers. It means that every six months—for instance, for orange juice—if there was a shift from 30 per cent Brazilian concentrate to 70 per cent concentrate or if it was 100 per cent Australian juice, we get to know about it. Right now, this bill, even though it is an improvement on the current laws, does not give that level of detail. It does not give consumers details of where that ingredient comes from and what percentage of it is Australian or indeed imported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That in essence is what this amendment is about. I can indicate that I will be seeking to divide on this in the absence of any clear commitments from the government that it will progress this issue. But I look forward to the minister's response in respect of this. It is something I foreshadowed a number of months ago in the committee report where I set out these issues.</span>

I indicated to the minister that we would facilitate passage of this bill, so I will not be speaking at length on this question. I do have a serious matter that I do want addressed, and I will just explain to Senator Xenophon: the proposal you have advanced is, I understand, based on a sincere commitment to the strengthening of the regulatory regime, and I appreciate the intent of your sentiments in that regard. However, the moves to make the country of origin labelling more flexible, more digitalised, are of course something that both industry and consumers have more options on, and I think this bill does provide us with an opportunity to genuinely improve the amount of information that is available. I am also highly conscious of the fact that the minister has indicated that in terms of this particular regulation there is a requirement for Commonwealth-state agreement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are supporting these reforms, but we do not believe that the arrangements this bill puts in place are perfect. Many further improvements are required. I have been spending more and more time in the food industry's processing plants in this country. Recently I visited the Australian smallgoods food manufacturer Bertocchi. Bertocchi is a major manufacturing employer in Melbourne's north and is making significant investments in plant and new equipment. When those investments are completed there will be something like 700 people on the payroll at Bertocchi. It is the third largest smallgoods manufacturer in the country. This is exactly the sort of investment we need, especially in Victoria, given what is happening with the automotive industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Food manufacturers like Bertocchi work in a highly regulated industry, and changes to labelling have very serious impacts on their costs of doing business. I have spoken to the company about their concerns and the need for greater flexibility. I have raised these concerns with the minister, and I want to thank the minister for facilitating access to the department at senior officer level and through AusIndustry. There are a range of issues that Bertocchi needs assistance on, which can best be provided by direct contact with serious people within the department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point here, though, is that the proposal Senator Xenophon has advanced to us today does not solve the problems for Bertocchi. Changes to the country of origin labelling which are already in place are the result of very extensive consultation with industry and consumers as well as state and federal governments, and I do not think we can step outside that process. The circumventing of this process with new reporting requirements, additional reporting requirements, introduced at the 11th hour is not an advisable way to be introducing regulations of this importance, particularly regulations that have such wide-ranging and potentially negative impacts on Australian food manufacturers—and, I might suggest, with limited benefit to consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the minister's statements reflected in the explanatory memorandum in regard to the review process after two years. If the changes to the reporting requirement are needed, I think the review process provides us with an opportunity to secure further changes in a well thought out, coherent way. But my question really goes to this: Minister, you have made some assurances, which I appreciate, but I really think it is appropriate that you outline to the chamber what this review mechanism is—what do you have in mind? How will the process be managed? How will you be able to ensure through any such process that the regulatory system will be genuinely flexible and the best practice for Australian manufacturers such as Bertocchi? What precisely do you have in mind in regard to the review? How are you going to fund it, and what actually is the process of engagement with industry?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  I have a couple of points to begin with. The first is: in terms of the review process, I had in mind an informal process which involved dealing with the stakeholders. I was not going to set up a formalised working group with a fancy name and give it a big budget because I think this is an ongoing process. As I said before, there will be a review at the end of two years but within the two years there is going to be scope to be talking to people, including the Australian Made Campaign, about how this goes forward. I am happy to look at a more formal process. If that is something the shadow minister and others think would be a good thing, I am happy to discuss that further. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also have to go back to COAG in due course because we have come at this through a Commonwealth-state process. There will be a regulatory impact statement under Australian consumer law; there will be mechanisms. But I am happy to talk about this further. Having opened this can of worms, if you like, it is clear—and the Bertocchi the example that you use is an example of this—that there are issues where more flexibility is required and so we are acting in a way which promotes the needs of Australian enterprises. I accept that. I am willing to consult further on what the review process will be, but it will also involve that Commonwealth-state mechanism in due course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to what Senator Xenophon has said, again, I appreciate the spirit in which he has made those points. The regulation impact statement which was provided in the explanatory memorandum explored the relative importance to consumers of disclosing the origin of specific ingredients and the burden to business of responding to such a requirement. It concluded that consumers prefer to see origin information on labels, not digitally, and that they value knowing the Australian content of products more highly than the origin of specific ingredients. The regulation impact statement also concluded that it is not currently feasible for businesses in the food industry to make origin information on specific or all ingredients available digitally, especially for small and micro producers. I think this is where my concern is. It is one thing to be talking about a multinational corporation which has all sorts of resources to do all sorts of things and can finance all sorts of overheads, but in the case of the smaller producers in particular—and I think this is where the flexibility point comes in—we have to have some recognition of their particular needs. However, we will be working with the food business to examine mechanisms for improving the digital infrastructure of the food industry over time. From my point of view, it is more the SMEs which are an issue in that regard. We will continue to look at ways through which we can improve consumer access to the information that matters to them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I thank the minister for his response and Senator Carr for his contribution. I make this point: companies such as the very successful smallgoods company in Victoria that Senator Carr referred to—and I wish them every success and I hope they grow along with food processing companies across the nation—know what is in their food. They know what they have put in there and they ought to know as a matter of course where that ingredient comes from. That is not a difficult or onerous requirement. I am suggesting that consumers do prefer to see basic information on their labels when they are making a buying decision in the supermarket. But I think it could change the culture of some food processors, particularly multinational processors, if they were required to publish this information. It would not be overly onerous. There could be, for instance, a minimum threshold on the turnover of the business if there is a concern about administrative burdens, but it would actually empower consumers in a significant way to have more information than they otherwise would have. I ask the minister: given there will be a review, will the review include consideration of providing further information online and the feasibility of doing so in the context of that review? In other words, are the terms of the review set? If not, how will that be set? Does the minister have the ability to ensure that this particular issue of providing further information online on a regular basis is something that will be considered as part of the review?</span>

Overall, we still believe that we have some way to go until we have the best country-of-origin labelling that we need in this country. We feel that there is still room for improvement. We are going to be supporting the bill overall because we think that what has been put forward is a step forward and it is an improvement. It is in that spirit as well that we are supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment. We do not think it is perfect; we think it is probably a reasonable amount of work. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating to see how much value it really would be to consumers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not accept the position being put that it would be too much of a regulatory burden. As Senator Xenophon has pointed out, food manufacturers know where their ingredients come from and, if they do not, they need to know, because they need to have that accountability in the supply chain. So, given that they are paying their bills and know that they bought X-kilograms of walnuts from California or whatever it is, I do not think it is going to be too much for that to be reported in a manner which then gives more transparency and accountability to the Australian consumer and to see that what is on the labels of food that a consumer is buying is reflected and true over a period of time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we are on a journey in terms of this country-of-origin labelling. If we keep on working at it, we will get there and eventually end up with labelling so that we have that transparency and consumers know what they are buying to eat. It does mean that it is going to place more focus on people knowing what they are eating and, because of that, they will be paying more attention to it. I think it will support people in making healthier and more sustainable food choices. This legislation is heading us in that direction. We have still got a way to go, but I think Senator Xenophon's amendment is perhaps going to be only a small step forward to getting some legislation that meets the requirements of healthy, sustainable food consumption in Australia. </span>

The first is that we all accept the importance of providing this sort of information, given the context in which the recent reforms have come about. It really goes to very basic issues for all of us as human beings, wanting to be assured that what we are eating is, as you say, Senator Rice, safe; it is the best; and, where possible, we are also supporting local industry in a non-distorting way, if I can put it like that. I accept all of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also accept the need to provide more information rather than less where that is feasible and where we are not providing undue regulatory burdens. I think we agree on that. What you are really saying is that you do not believe the regulatory burden is as great as some people may be making out. We are going to test that in the review period as we look at the further digitisation of the food industry. I think that is going to be very important. As I said before in response to Senator Xenophon, we will be consulting people on the terms of the review, and that will obviously include the Greens as well. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I rise today to address a deeply troubling challenge facing my home state of Victoria—that of energy affordability and security. All of us in this place know of the recent closure of the Hazelwood power station in the Latrobe Valley and the loss of 800 jobs from the local economy and the devastation that inflicted on the Latrobe Valley community. Last year, in 2016, the Andrews Labor government increased the minerals royalty charge by 300 per cent—which is an extraordinary number—completely disregarding the concerns that this would reduce the viability of energy companies in Victoria and that it would cause significant increases in the cost of power in our state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the results have been very clear: Hazelwood workers are out of a job and Victorians are facing increases of up to $300 a year on their energy bills. Hazelwood supplied up to a quarter of Victoria's energy, but its closure makes our state reliant on others, instead of being energy self-sufficient. For a state with the energy resources of Victoria that is entirely unacceptable. This reliance puts our state in a very dangerous position. If observing Australia's energy market over the last year has taught us anything at all, it is that depending on other states for power can leave the lights off and bring business to a grinding halt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent experience in South Australia shows us that states must be able to stand on their own two feet and supply local power for their people and their businesses. I ask: how can a state prosper when it fails to provide reliable power at an affordable price to its citizens? The answer is that it simply cannot. It is impossible. South Australia has unfortunately demonstrated the consequences of high energy costs and of creating an environment that is entirely hostile to investment, to business growth and, ultimately, to employment and to employment opportunities. South Australia has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, with Arrium's Whyalla Steelworks the most notable example of those job losses. The Wetherill Labor government's decision to provide unjustifiably high subsidies to wind and solar power suppliers has triggered blackouts and a spike in energy costs that has brought almost the entire state to its knees. It is something we have spoken about in this chamber and that has been spoken about repeatedly in the media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While South Australia's energy security and economic woes are a sad corollary of South Australia's ideological approach to energy production, my primary concern is for the state I was elected to represent. Indeed, I hold grave fears for Victoria's energy security under an Andrews Labor government, a government that has put Victoria on the same path as South Australia. And if the Andrews government's 40 per cent renewable energy target is a threat to affordable and secure energy in Victoria, then my greatest concern is that Mr. Shorten's Labor opposition and their 50 per cent renewable energy target represents an even worse threat across our nation. Mr Shorten wants Australia to source 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030, the exact same goal as Premier Jay Wetherill and his ill-fated state of South Australia. One would think that the malaise lingering around the South Australian economy is evidence that extreme renewable energy targets cannot sit alongside the goals of job creation and improving living standards, which Australians expect and deserve. Certainly, Victorians expect and deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At their heart, extreme renewable energy targets represent an ideological approach to energy that places emissions reduction ahead of energy security, and energy security is our priority. As it currently stands, renewable energy sources are unable to provide a consistent, secure baseload power supply to the national grid. Instead, renewables like wind and solar supply intermittent power, which unfortunately comes with major drawbacks. Put simply, when the wind ain't blowing and the sun ain't shining, power is simply not being generated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is acutely aware of these issues and has made a decisive move to improve Australia's long-neglected energy storage capacity. This, I believe, is particularly exciting. The Prime Minister has requested that ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation work together on a new funding round for large-scale energy storage solutions. This storage will improve the stability and the reliability of variable renewables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But renewables alone will not fulfil our goal of stable and secure energy supplies. As old high-emissions power stations are retired, we will need to consider more baseload power to fill that void and be capable of supplying power day in and day out. As the world's largest coal exporter we have a vested interest in showing that we can provide both lower emissions and reliable baseload power with state-of-the-art clean coal-fired technology, utilising both combustion efficiency and pollution control. It is possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, our approach to emissions reduction should be technology agnostic—the maximum emissions reduction for the least amount of economic damage to families and to businesses. We should employ our vast supplies of coal in cutting-edge facilities that will allow us to use our natural competitive advantage in power production to deliver low-cost energy to Australian homes and businesses. Let me make it clear that our commitment to the federal renewable energy target remains unwavering, but this government is determined to achieve its target without the devastating impact that a 50 per cent renewable energy target under Labor, sadly demonstrated in South Australia, would have upon Australian businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull coalition government is approaching emissions reduction and energy security in a clear-eyed and far more pragmatic way. We are not at all shackled to certain technological methods, unlike those opposite, but rather we are determined to make sure that we choose the most practical, efficient path towards emissions reduction. This government is determined that Australia should be able to achieve the policy trifecta of energy that is affordable, reliable and secure. Labor's approach is driven simply by ideology, heedless of the cost of the thousands of Australian jobs that it will destroy. I am determined that my state will not follow in the same path as South Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  I rise to speak in the Senate tonight on an issue of great importance to the people of the Northern Territory, to Northern Australia, to Australians in the Pacific region and to all those who rely on the ABC's short-wave radio service right across this country. On 6 December the ABC decided to reveal information showing that it would no longer allow short-wave radio to continue beyond 31 January. This was the first time that anyone in Northern Australia had learnt of, or was even aware that the ABC was considering, this drastic change to their lives. One of the incredibly disappointing aspects of this, on top of the announcement itself, is that they only gave seven weeks notice and that they provided the information at a time when we in the north are incredibly vulnerable to the weather conditions, as it is the wet season. We are vulnerable to cyclones, to floodings and to all kinds of unpredictable weather. In fact, even in the Pacific as recently as earlier this week the Solomon Islands were receiving warnings about flooding and possible landslides. People there were being encouraged to listen to short-wave radio, which now no longer exists, because on 31 January short-wave radio was switched off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is short-wave radio important to the people of Northern Australia? Because it is the only reliable source of information that people can tune in to rain, hail or shine. It is the only reliable information that people can access, because there is no thorough access with internet coverage, telephone communications or even satellite phones. Satellite phones rely on the sun shining. In places like Northern Australia the sun does not shine all the time. If you are trying to hold that satellite phone out there to try and get information about the weather, or to get emergency details out, or even just to talk to someone because you are feeling isolated and alone and it is something important for your emotional health and wellbeing, you cannot access it 100 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I explain these things to give the Senate an understanding of Australia's vast remoteness—and I am not talking about the 'VAST' technology yet; I am talking about 'vast' in the sense of remoteness. The remoteness is so great in this country, and people choose to live in various beautiful parts of Australia—people who farm their properties; people who muster their cattle; people who fish in our seas for their livelihoods; people who man the coastlines looking out for illegal fishing boats and monitoring the dugongs and sea turtles around our coasts; and people who travel the hundreds and thousands of kilometres across our many roads in our vast areas of country. All of these people listen to short-wave radio. It is their only form of communication. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, if you are living on an isolated cattle station, you are told that you must have access to VAST—viewer access satellite television. On your cattle station, you must now carry that satellite dish on your horse as you muster cattle, as you set up camp out on the Barkly, or as you go across the VRD. Make sure you take that big satellite dish and put it on your horse, because that is the only way you are going to be able to know what is going on in terms of communication. And there is more—those of you out in your tinnies, prepare to put that big satellite dish on the end of your boat. As you are out there fishing for your livelihood, wanting to know what the weather patterns are doing, whether there is a cyclone coming, whether a particular creek or waterway is a place to go, just throw that satellite dish on your tinny and you'll be right, mate. For all those truckies who travel the regions delivering food supplies and mail, just chuck that satellite dish on your truck, mate, and you'll be right, too. That is what the ABC and that is what the Turnbull government are expecting the people of Northern Australia to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not have the capability yet, as our brothers and sisters in the cities of the south do, to access the digital technology that we so do want to access. We want to have that, but we are not there yet, and we should not be missing out on vital services as a result of someone's brainwave decision to remove the only service that provides information for all of these categories that I have explained so far, and also for our Aboriginal communities who need to know what is going on. It is not good enough for the ABC or even the government to say that FM and AM services are accessible when people are telling you they are not. I urge senators: travel out to Northern Australia and find out for yourselves. I urge the minister and I certainly call on the Managing Director of the ABC to go out to these regions. This is not a call because people feel like making a problem. This is a call that is based on people's livelihoods. It is a life and death matter for many people, and I quote that from the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association. They worry about their pastoralists who remain isolated for long periods of time as a result of their cattle work. These are people whose own emotional health and wellbeing is dramatically impacted because of this decision as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is incredibly serious to northern Australia, and I ask southern Australia to take a deep breath and acknowledge when you have made a serious error in judgement. Do not keep passing the buck and saying, 'It's someone else's decision; isn't it bad!' To hear the minister stand up today and admit that the consultation process was totally inadequate and that the time given to the people of northern Australia and indeed the Pacific region—six weeks over Christmas and New Year; such limited time to respond appropriately—was a complete slap in the face. It was a complete rejection by the ABC of its own listeners—very loyal listeners—and by this government to accept that that decision is okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite have said that Labor is wanting the Turnbull government to direct the ABC. We are not asking that at all. We are saying: just do your job. Fund the ABC adequately so that these kinds of decisions do not have to be made. In fact, go further: today you admit to the House, to the Senate, that consultation was totally inadequate. Well, then, stop this. Work with the ABC, Minister. Allow the proper consultation process to take place. Reinstate the service and make sure you fund it adequately going forward for all Australians. </span>
