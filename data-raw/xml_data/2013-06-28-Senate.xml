                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  Never before in the history of the Senate have the provisions of the standing orders been so abused under this new Kevin Rudd government. It was bad enough under the Julia Gillard government, but it is even worse under Mr Rudd. Today we have had a motion rammed through dealing with changes to the Privileges Committee, which is the most important committee of this place, which makes recommendations in relation to penalties to be imposed on senators. Just as these tax bills will be guillotined in a matter of 17 minutes, so these people opposite—the Greens-Labor alliance—have guillotined a decision in relation to the most important committee of this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Honourable senators will recall that, during question time this week, I asked the now deposed Leader of the Government in the Senate whether any deal had been done with the Australian Greens to get their agreement, their connivance, to move this unprecedented guillotine of over 55 bills this week. Senators will also recall that, in the term of the Howard government, 2004-07, when we had a majority in the Senate, only 32 bills in three years were guillotined. Here this week the Senate is being abused, with 55 bills being guillotined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But not content with guillotining bills through this place, those opposite—the Labor Party—are now doing the dirty work for the Australian Greens, sponsoring Greens' motions as government business. So we had to have the pantomime of the Thespian Senator Bob Carr, at question time, claiming to attack the Greens. What a pathetic act that was, when we now see the dirty, sleazy deals that are done behind closed doors, away from the microphones. When I asked Senator Conroy, 'Can you give an assurance that no deal has been done with the Greens in relation to the guillotine?' he studiously avoided the question. He did not deny the allegation. We now know why. It is because the government has agreed to sponsor this outrageous motion that will set in train a system for the Privileges Committee on the very last day of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the urgency? Nobody can tell us. What is the urgency to put this in the standing orders to give the Greens a permanent position on the Privileges Committee? There is no answer other than that it is the basis of a dirty sleazy deal. So on the very last day of this parliament there are the Australian Labor Party and the Greens: they may have publicly ripped up the marriage certificate, but they are still co-habiting and behaving exactly as they want. It is a raw abuse of the power of this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are debating a tax bill and the whole Senate is given less than 20 minutes to discuss its provisions. Then, after that, we will have another 11-plus bills—guillotine, guillotine, guillotine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I say to the empty press gallery: it is a disgrace. But I will give one compliment to the ABC, because we are being broadcast courtesy of the ABC, and so some people in Australia will get to understand the gross hypocrisy of some of the scribes in the press gallery who wrote column after column after column condemning the Liberal and National Party majority in the Senate for the outrage against democracy for forcing 32 bills through the Senate. Where are their fingers on the keyboards when this disgraceful Greens-Labor alliance guillotines not 32, not 64, not 96 but 216 bills, and then rorts the Privileges Committee to boot on the very last day of the parliament? They are trying to future-proof the position of the Greens and the Labor Party in the event that the Australian people decide to change the government. This is raw abuse. The Australian people need to understand that the so-called country Independents in the other place did nothing against this raw abuse and nor did the Greens. Indeed, the Greens were active participants.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question for the Australian people at the next election will be a very simple one: whom do you trust to safeguard the role of the Senate as a house of review, to have the checks and balances in place on its powerful Privileges Committee and to respect the role of the Senate? The Liberal and National parties are clearly the best custodians of the role of the Senate. The Greens and the ALP have been shown to be the exact opposite. An unprecedented number of bills have been guillotined throughout this parliament—over 200. This week alone there were 55 bills—in one week, one and a half times the number of bills that the Howard government did in three years. Am I saying that the guillotine should never be used? Of course not. All this argument is about is a sense of proportion, a sense of decorum and a sense of decency. What we know about those opposite is that those qualities mean nothing to them. They are completely foreign to them. If you have the numbers you use them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What better example do we have other than your newly elected leader, who said to the people only months ago: 'I am a man of integrity and of my word. I will not challenge for the leadership.' You know why he was a man of integrity at that time? It was because he did not have the numbers. But as soon as he had the numbers: 'The Australian people demand it of me.' And so he breaks his solemn promise to the Australian people. What is more with those opposite, we have now seen the faceless man Bill Shorten becoming the two-faced man, with blood on both hands. This is the morality of the government. This is the standard of the government. Well may they change their leader, because they have not changed their morality, they have not changed their decency and they have not changed their respect, or disrespect I should say, for this place. It is situation normal, just with a different face: a bloke wearing a blue tie—whatever that might mean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of the Senate is vital in our federal system of government; it is one of the vital checks and balances. One of the good-news stories is that, if the Liberal and National parties were to one day gain a majority in the Senate, we would actually allow our members to cross the floor and represent their states. In this parliament have you ever seen the Greens, who claim to be quasi-Independents, split? Have they ever crossed the floor?</span>

Of course not, because they are corralled by their socialist dogma that everybody has to give in to the majority, irrespective of the issue of the day. We, in the Liberal and National parties, believe in the individual right of people to cross the floor. We believe in the role of the Senate. We see the importance of the role of the Senate as a house of review, as a states' house, and that is why we are so angry today at the way this important institution has been so willingly abused by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens. It beggars belief when you hear the commentary from Senator Christine Milne, the Leader of the Australian Greens, when she condemned the Howard government, and the comments of Senator Conroy and others.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that is before us will allow individuals to withdraw excess contributions above the concessional contribution cap. It will apply an interest charge to individuals who exceed the cap, to account for the income tax that would have been paid if the amounts had been taken as wages or salary. And so the list goes on. The question is: if this is such good legislation, why is it that the Labor Party and the Australian Greens do not want to ventilate the provisions of this legislation and all the other legislation? If you are so proud of your legislative agenda and if you are so proud of the things you are trying to ram through the parliament, wouldn't you be saying, 'Let's have an extra week or two of sittings so that all of these wonderful policies of ours can be fully ventilated, and so that the Australian people can see what a great government we really are—how we really are serving the welfare of the people of Australia'? But they know that they are not. They are ramming through legislation after legislation that is not within the best interests of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night we saw the ramming through of extra provisions in relation to the right of entry laws, giving union bosses—believe it or not—even more power. Having made a solemn promise that the right of entry rules would remain, in 2007, they gave union bosses an extra 157 powers in the Fair Work Act—a complete breach of promise—and then last night they gave them an extra power to invade every lunch room in this country. They are so proud of it that they wanted to guillotine it and restrict debate, because they do not want the Australian people to know about it. My friend and colleague Senator George Brandis reminded me just before we came into the chamber that, in the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, there was a matter of such importance that those opposite wanted to ventilate before the public that they called for public submissions. Great! The only problem: 40 hours to get your submissions in—not even two days. Not only do they rort the legislative agenda with their raw abuse of the guillotine, not only do they rort the Privileges Committee—they rort the committee system as a whole. If you have the numbers, according to the Green-Labor alliance, you use them, you abuse them and you achieve whatever end you want irrespective of how unprincipled or how unprecedented it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That should not surprise anybody, because we have seen it from the very top of this government with Mr Rudd, who made a solemn promise that he would never challenge while he did not have the numbers, but he never told us that that was the caveat so here he is challenging and getting the leadership in complete breach of that solemn promise. Should that surprise us? His predecessor got into power saying there will be no carbon tax and then she implemented one. Mr Rudd said he would not challenge and then did challenge, and now he is Prime Minister. Their two top people have got into their position through deceit. The honour of an individual, the strength of character of an individual, is that if you have made a promise you stick by it no matter how it hurts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best example of that was the former Prime Minister John Howard, who genuinely changed his mind on the goods and services tax. He had made a solemn promise to the Australian people, so what did he do? He went back to the Australian people and said, 'I am not going to abuse my position of Prime Minister and implement a GST; I am going back to you with a promise that, should you re-elect me, I will implement a GST.' That is a stark example of the difference in character, in integrity and honesty, between leadership of the coalition and leadership of the ALP. When we come to the next election I would call upon the Australian people to consider who they trust. Do they trust a man who deceives his own leader and says 'I will not challenge, I am a man of honour', and then does challenge, or, if they get rid of him again and reinstall Ms Gillard, a lady who said there will be no carbon tax and then implemented one? Or do they trust a coalition that when it did have the numbers in this place used them in a measured manner to ensure that the institution of the Senate and the parliament was protected, a party that has in its makeup, in its DNA, a respect for the Australian electorate so that when you make a solemn promise like 'no GST' you do not implement one without first getting a separate deliberate mandate from the Australian people, without being open and honest and upfront with them?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my area of workplace relations, the Labor Party demanded at the last election that there should be no changes to the Fair Work Act; they had the balance absolutely right—they had negotiated with employers and employees; they said they had the balance right. They got back in, with the connivance of the Australian Greens and the country Independents, and 400 pages of amendments to the Fair Work Act have been passed by the 43rd parliament—in complete breach of their promise and their assertion to the Australian people that the Fair Work Act was perfect and did not need amending. Here we are, 400 pages later. Having got the balance right between employers and employees in the original Fair Work Bill that was not to be touched, we now have 400 pages oozing with deals and privileges for the trade union bosses—no balance anymore; a complete breach of promise to the Australian electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we get into the dying hours of this parliament and of this sitting week, the Australian people have a stark contrast between an opposition that has a real solutions plan that has been put out to the Australian people for them to consider in detail, and a government that is riven and driven by revenge, personality and hostilities, without an agenda for the nation other than two items on Mr Rudd's agenda: revenge within and attack on Tony Abbott without. If he were to be Prime Minister after the next election, he would sit back and say, 'My great achievement is to deny Mr Abbott the prime ministership.' That sort of relentless negativity is not acceptable.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013, which is yet another bill which is going to be guillotined in the dying hours of this parliament, to add to the other 55 bills that will be guillotined and the 216 bills that this government, with their Green alliance partners, are guillotining in this place. It is absolutely outrageous, but I am not surprised that this bill has been shuffled in. It has been on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> about five or six times, but it is little wonder that we are seeing it now in the dying hours, because this is a bill that is intended to clean up another major stuff-up by this Rudd-Gillard government. This one is sheeted home to Mr Rudd, because when the stuff-up occurred he was at the helm. Here we are, in the dying hours, trying to retrospectively fix a major problem that this government has created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill contains a number of non-contentious issues. It deals with various changes in relation to food standards, medical training and industrial chemicals. I will not dwell on those. The contentious issue of this bill surrounds Medicare. Medicare is a brand, as we all know, that belongs to the Australian people. As the law currently stands, the use of the word 'Medicare' is protected by section 41C of the Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973. This provision creates an offence of the use of the name 'Medicare' in connection with a business, trade, profession or occupation. Where the name 'Medicare' or a prescribed symbol is used as part of the name or emblem of an association, or in connection with any activity of the association, the association, if it is a body corporate, is guilty of an offence. If the association is not a body corporate, every member of the committee of management is guilty of an offence. Section 41C(6) does state:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Proceedings under this section shall not be instituted without the consent in writing of the Attorney<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:MS Mincho;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‑</span>General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so we have, in 2010, then Prime Minister Rudd announcing his grand health reform agenda, which included replacement of divisions of general practices with new primary healthcare organisations to be known as 'Medicare Locals'. Of course, at the time they initiated this so-called health reform agenda, the member for Griffith was Prime Minister and former Attorney-General Roxon was the Minister for Health and Ageing. It is a matter of public record that their working relationship was, suffice it to say, less than ideal. It is very clear from comments that have been made recently how Ms Roxon actually feels about Mr Rudd. Having trawled through the innards of that so-called health reform, it is very clear why their relationship was such a negative one. One can only imagine the conversations when Prime Minister Rudd and then Minister Roxon trawled through those hundred hospital visits in their white coats—Doctor Rudd and Nurse Roxon trailing around the countryside, basically photoshoots. The photoshoots were really what it was all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that Prime Minister Rudd is back, no doubt it will all be about photoshoots and spin, because that is all the so-called health reform was about—that and the billions of dollars that have been wasted on all those new bureaucracies which are doing very little and not serving patients. All this money has been wasted on bureaucracies, and not one patient has been assisted. But let me return to the bill at hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nineteen Medicare Locals were established in July 2011, and the full 61 were operational in July 2012. They have been established as companies and receive funding from the Department of Health and Ageing. According to the act, those entities may be guilty of an offence for use of the name Medicare. Clause 22 of the bill repeals section 41C(6) and replaces it with an exemption to offence provisions for activities authorised by the secretary or a prescribed delegate. What does that basically mean? The clear purpose of this legislation is to retrospectively legalise the government's franchising of the Medicare brand to Medicare Locals and also give the government greater scope for similar future activities—as I said, nothing more than retrospectively fixing a bungle that this government created. Now they are doing it in the dying days of this parliament in the hope that it will all be shuffled under the carpet and nobody will notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Ms Roxon, the then Minister for Health and Ageing who set up these entities called Medicare Locals, it is very clear that all Labor were trying to do was look for the headline. That is why they chose to use the name Medicare; it was to dupe people into thinking they were going to receive some sort of medical service. You would think that, when a member of the Australian public enters a Medicare local, they would have some very reasonable expectations of some form of medical service, but under this government nothing can be assumed. You cannot enter a Medicare local office and receive any form of Medicare assistance. You cannot enter a Medicare local office and have a Medicare claim processed. You cannot enter a Medicare local and see a doctor. You cannot enter a Medicare local and see a nurse or receive any form of medical attention. In fact, Medicare Locals have absolutely nothing to do with Medicare or with any form of medical assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first heard the name 'Medicare local', I thought it was a place to get a refund and a beer! Indeed, over estimates I have actually asked what bright spark in the Department of Health and Ageing came up with the name. I asked back in 2010. Now I understand why the bureaucrats gave me a weasel-word answer. I never got a straight answer to my question. I asked again in 2011 and again I did not get a proper answer. On 6 June this year I again trawled through, and it was very clear by the gobbledegook that I was given—the bureau babble speak—that this was nothing more than a massive stuff-up that the government is now trying desperately to rectify, because all Medicare Locals, as the law stands at the moment, are in breach of the law. It is another monumental display of incompetence from a desperate and dysfunctional government in a blatant attempt to fool the Australian people into thinking that they are getting some form of health benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to know from the minister how much money has actually been wasted by this government on building the brand name 'Medicare Locals'. I would like to know from the minister when this government was first advised that using the name 'Medicare Locals' was a clear breach of Commonwealth legislation. I would like to know what exactly a Medicare Local is—what do they actually do? We have trawled through hours and hours of estimates, hours and hours of discussions in relation to—</span>

                    </a>  Minister Plibersek has sought to indicate that the findings in a report released by the National Health Performance Authority, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australians</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> experience</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> with primary</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> health</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> care in 2010-11</span>, are not what they seem. In her press release, 'Report highlights the importance of Medicare Locals', she makes the following two inconsistent statements: 'The National Health Performance Authority report reinforced the importance of Medicare Locals.' She also states: 'while the data in this report predates the establishment of Medicare Locals'. So, in one quote the minister pretends that a report justifies 3,000 staff that have grown from a couple of hundred in 12 months when the report, by her own admission, was compiled under data predating the establishment of Medicare Locals. This is the first time that we have seen Minister Plibersek confirming that there are over 3,000 people, mostly staff, who do not see any patients and are employed across the Medicare Local network. Now this government is spending over a billion dollars on its dozens of new bureaucracies, new structures, and it wonders why it has no money left for patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From a coalition perspective, we have consistently said that we support a role for the coordination of primary care, but we do not support money being prioritised away from patients into vast bureaucratic structures. It is also worth noting that the Department of Health and Ageing and its existing agencies already employ over 6,000 people. According to the minister, this number has effectively increased by 50 per cent. When the sad and sorry saga of the Rudd-Gillard government comes to an end, Minister Plibersek will be remembered for pouring taxpayers' money into bureaucratic positions and not pouring money into more doctors, nurses or beds. For this reason the coalition has indicated that we will be formally reviewing the structure of Medicare Locals if we are elected in September.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this debate it is worth pondering on some of Labor's health record during its time over both the Rudd and the Gillard governments: $1.6 billion ripped out of public hospitals; $4 billion ripped out of private health insurance; and $1 billion ripped out of dental health through the closure of the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. There was the promise of 16 early psychosis prevention and intervention centres, EPPICs, which were supposedly to be in partnership with the state governments. Whilst the agreements were about to be signed with some of those governments, all of a sudden Minister Butler changed his mind, ripped all that up, and decided to change his tack on the centres, and all we have is a one-page press release with very, very little detail as to how all of this is actually going to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am conscious of the time, so I will make some general closing comments, because I do know that Senator Back wants to make a contribution in this space as well. The coalition, as I said, continues to support a role for coordination of primary health services. However, it is very, very clear that there remains a considerable lack of detail and conflicting information regarding the objectives of Medicare Locals. In relation to the current level of practical assistance provided to general practice there is a lack of detail about allied health professionals and patients and about how funding is being administered. We know that there is a lot of money being channelled through Medicare Locals, but we do not know how that money is being administered. More importantly, is it being administered effectively and is the Commonwealth getting value for money for these so-called 'services'? Are they effective in regard to their cooperation with the local hospital networks to keep people out of hospitals? We keep hearing that the lists in our hospitals are growing, and supposedly Medicare Locals are assisting with those lists, but the lists are increasing. We know that there is a duplication of function with existing state health programs, but we do not know how Medicare Locals determine market failure in their area and intervene without disrupting existing services. It is very important that, given the significant investment the Commonwealth is making, the coalition ensures that that funding is being spent as effectively as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by saying that this bill is mostly uncontentious, barring the issue surrounding Medicare Locals. It is nothing more than a blatant attempt to fix up what has been a massive stuff-up by the government by trying to pass off a name, which is well known to the Australian people as an office that delivers a particular service, to somehow buy themselves goodwill with yet another bureaucracy that we now know employs 3,000 people. We do not really know what they do and they certainly do not provide any services to Australians. It is an absolute disgrace. It is so typical of not only the dysfunction but the waste of these governments under Mr Rudd then Ms Gillard and now under Mr Rudd again. Of course, it will not be finishing there because, now that the ego has landed, I am sure we are going to see so much more spin and many more photo shoots that were so characteristic of his previous time as Prime Minister. As I said, the coalition will be moving an amendment to this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  With regret I reflect on the gross embarrassment that has been visited upon this government when, on the last day that the 43rd parliament is sitting, we have to rush in through the back door and try to undo a gross level of incompetence that started with this Prime Minister, who was 'that Prime Minister Rudd', and is now the recycled Prime Minister Rudd, along with his then health minister Ms Roxon. What a shame <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes Minister</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Prime Minister</span> are not still alive, because there would be richness in the incompetence of this government should the writers of those series ever want to pick the pen up and have another go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They, of course, reflected on the hospital with no patients. Here we have something far worse: the action of a government led by an incompetent minister with oversight from a grossly incompetent Prime Minister. They managed to establish a scenario in which the name Medicare, a prescribed symbol, should be used only in relation to Medicare itself. They found themselves in a circumstance where, by using the term Medicare Local, they made the body corporate of any association using the term guilty of an offence. If an association that used the term Medicare Local, as approved illegally by this government, was not a body corporate, then every member of the committee of management of that association was guilty of an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a scandalous situation—a Prime Minister who by that stage was totally out of control, a cabinet who could not in any way bring the man back to focus on good policy. The most endangered thing at that time was anyone who got between Mr Rudd and a camera or between Mr Rudd and a member of the media, who had been duped by the plethora and the football team of spin doctors. A health minister found herself in a scenario in which she was oversighting a circumstance where, under the Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973, section 41C, entities would be guilty of an offence if they used the name Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to look to the future because the present and the past, unfortunately, are littered with failure by a man whose own side had to remove him as Prime Minister simply because in their minds he was so incompetent that he could not govern the country. We then had transparency, we then had the light being let in for three years and—almost to the day—Ms Gillard, who replaced Mr Rudd herself, was then deposed only this week. I do not know if the young people in the gallery were here earlier in the week but, if you were, you were actually part of history when the second Prime Minister unelected in this circumstance was replaced by the first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should the coalition be privileged with government after the election—whenever that is held; it was to be 14 September and, if it comes forward from that, that is the end of the local government referendum, and if it is after that, who knows what will go on?—there is one thing that the Australian people have to know. The country will be led by a man who was an outstandingly successful health minister—Tony Abbott, a person who during his ministry significantly increased medical research funding in this country, a person who was able to extend the benefits of Medicare to allied health services including diabetes treatment, a person who singularly and spectacularly was able to significantly decrease the incidence of smoking by young people with the introduction of graphic health warnings. Contrast that with the efforts of this government recently with the new world-first legislation that has completely and utterly removed the names on packages to no effect. In fact, we do not know the reason and we are going to try to examine it. A large retailer in Perth recently told me there has been an increase of 25 per cent in the purchase of cigarettes through his retail operations since that came in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the excellence of Mr Abbott as health minister and the introduction of the Gardasil vaccine against human papillomavirus for young girls and women in this country, a world first. We have heard from the other side again—we hear it quite often from the person who is now the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Ms Wong—about the fact that Mr Abbott seemed to rip $1 billion out of the health budget. Let us actually examine what happened in that case, because in their last days the Labor government might learn something. Mr Abbott sat down as the minister and consulted widely with the health industry, with his own leaders and with state leaders. And you would not believe what they did: they set a budget to achieve clear guidelines and clear objectives—and they achieved those objectives and those key performance indicators. Like a good steward of good government showing good use of Australian taxpayers' money, they came in at $1 billion under what was budgeted. Was that a waste of taxpayers' money? If people think so, let them make that decision on the day the election is held.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I go on further, if I may, because I understand from my leader in this area, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, that in government the coalition will commission a formal review and it will look at those key elements upon which this government, the Labor government of Mr Rudd, has been a failure. I have already been part of that review process, when we brought the now shadow health minister, Mr Dutton, to the town of Narrogin in the Great Southern of WA some weeks ago. Nine or 10 shire representatives, aged-care providers, doctors, nurses and others came in and Mr Dutton sat down and did something this crowd would not know about: he actually listened. And I am very proud to say: in the aged-care area, Senator Fierravanti-Wells will be doing exactly the same thing in my home state of Western Australia in the near future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time left available to me, I want to reflect on the terms of reference for the review that will be undertaken by the coalition. It is to evaluate the practical interaction with local hospital networks, including their boundaries. It is to examine tendering and contracting arrangements. It is to look at general practice and the capacity, as Mr Dutton so eloquently said in Narrogin recently, to actually recognise general practice as the cornerstone of primary care, which, of course, this government has removed. It is to ensure Commonwealth funding supports clinical services—clinical services rather than administration. I hope the young people up there in the gallery are feeling healthy and well and I hope they are attending to their studies, because what they need to know is that, under this government, under the leadership commenced by Mr Rudd, now having picked up that mantle again, this country today is paying $1,000 million a month interest on the debt that the Labor government has run up. That is $1 billion a month in interest—not in repayment of the debt; just in paying the interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Eggleston is himself an eminent doctor. How many hospitals around Australia, Senator Eggleston, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, could be built in this country for the $1 billion that we are now spending a month on interest? How many nursing posts around Australia could be established? How many medical practices could be supported? What medical and related research could be undertaken? What dental activity can be undertaken for low-socioeconomic members of our community just with the money that would be saved if this government had not squandered your money? I say I hope you are all in good form because it will be you, and even your children, who will be paying back that debt over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the tragedy in rural and regional Western Australia now. Provision of medical services in many areas is now broken. It is a joint responsibility between federal and state governments. But as Senator Eggleston and I know in WA, local governments themselves are paying money that they really do not have, up to a quarter of a million dollars a year, just to provide doctors in those small communities. If there are no doctors, you cannot expect families to stay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So therefore we have a circumstance, unfortunately, where local government is having to stump up its own money. Why in heaven's name local governments in rural Western Australia would be supporting a referendum to give the federal government some control over their affairs where they currently have none I cannot possibly conceive. All I can do, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells has said, is to hope this crowd do not do more damage before they are kicked out.</span>

This is another important piece of legislation that is being guillotined through this place, with less than 25 minutes for debate. That means that only two people will get the opportunity to speak on this piece of legislation that is one of the 55 that is being guillotined through this place just in this week. There are 55 pieces of legislation; yet the previous Howard government was criticised up hill and down dale for guillotining 32 pieces of legislation in an entire term of parliament. Yet this bill is one of 55 guillotined in just one week and one of more than 216 in this term of parliament.</span>

They ignore the calls of industry to reduce the cost of government to business. They have a history of adding government cost to business.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot believe a word this Prime Minister says, just as you could not believe a word the previous Prime Minister said. The previous Prime Minister told us, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' then proceeded to introduce one. The new Prime Minister said, 'We will take a new approach to business,' then proceeded to continue with the old approach to business: add cost of government to business. The government talk about Australia being the food bowl of Asia. All they do is make us less competitive and make it more difficult to get product out of the country. Export fees and charges under this government have risen by up to 1,600 per cent for a small operator. We cannot afford to get our product out of the country, let alone be the food bowl of Asia. The government with this piece of legislation is doing more of the same, joined happily, I must say, by the Greens.</span>

                    </a>  It might be disorderly to interject, but it is within my right to acknowledge the interjection, and I do so because it makes the point that I want to make. This government, in conjunction with the Greens, has devastated Australian industry and business around this country—those two together, and particularly the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Mr Tony Burke, who set this process in train and who did a deal with environmental groups to set this process up. They wanted to get at agricultural chemicals that were available for industry. How do I know? They have told me that this has been a four-year campaign. They want to get rid of agricultural chemicals that are important to industry here in Australia. The Greens also want to get rid of agricultural chemicals that are important to industry here in Australia. That is why they have teamed up with the government. Senator Milne trots around the countryside saying the Greens are friends of the farmer. The farmers know who their friends and their enemies are, I can tell you quite clearly, Mr Acting Deputy President. They know and they tell me who their friends and enemies are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have another bill being guillotined through this place, another bill that will add red tape and cost to industry—an estimated $2 to $8 million a year. What do we hear from industry? What are industry crying out for at the moment? They are saying to us, 'We need you to reduce the cost of government to business.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We sat down in my office and we started doing a reconnoitre and looking over the dopey things that this government has done to agriculture. We came up with 13 pages of notes on additional costs from bad things that this government has done in respect of agriculture in this country. Firstly, there is the carbon tax. The government tried to tell agriculture that the carbon tax would not apply to them, but we know they all use energy. You talk to any dairy farmer—up to $15,000 in additional direct costs on farm from the carbon tax. Then there are the costs pushed back down the supply chain from the processors, because processing dairy products is an energy-intensive business—30 per cent of the cost of dried milk powder is energy. That cost cannot be passed back to the consumer, as some Labor members have tried to tell us industry could do, because product is sold on the global market. So the cost is passed back to the dairy farmer, and the dairy farmer wears that cost. We have Minister Burke, the culprit again, who said that dairy farmers would benefit from Coles selling milk for a dollar. That is how out of touch this government is. That is how out of touch with agriculture this government is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just imagine a small cherry exporter, like the one in my home state of Tasmania, who are looking to get cherries into the lucrative Asian market and are paying $500 a year for the registration of their shed. Those fees are to go to $8,500. They cannot afford to get the cherries out of the country; their total sales are $36,000 a year—a quarter of that just to register their shed for export. These are the absurdities that this government has come to with this through the last six years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And here, on the last day, guillotined with less than 25 minutes to speak in this place, we have another piece of legislation that adds millions of dollars a year to the cost of doing business for agriculture in this country. Agriculture came and told us that; the National Farmers Federation came and told us that. How are we to remain competitive in the global market—the global market that this government says is going to be an important part of the future for agriculture—if it is too expensive to get our product to market? Because the government has gone to sleep on free trade agreements we are at a tariff disadvantage getting into those markets, and then the government takes away access to the agricultural and veterinary chemicals that are important to the agricultural industry and animal husbandry to grow and produce that product that they are supposed to send. It is because Tony Burke did a deal with the environment groups before the 2010 election. That is the genesis of this. We know because they told us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the damage that this government has done to our markets by banning the live export trade to Indonesia. That did damage not only to our relationship but also to our markets. Then there was the flow-on damage, the absolute animal disaster that is occurring in the north at the moment, as a result of the fact that the stations up there are overstocked. This government has no affinity with the agricultural community. It has no understanding of the agricultural community. It is understandable that agriculture is so frustrated with the relationship and with the way that they have been treated, when the government continues to add the cost and red and green tape to their businesses, making them less competitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that here we have another piece of legislation that continues to add cost, that continues to add red tape. And it is no wonder that the opposition continues to express its dissatisfaction with the way that this government is treating it, as it has done with so many other elements. Minister Burke—I am not sure what he is minister for at the moment, but I understand that he is going to remain a minister even though he was a supporter of the previous Prime Minister—</span>

                    </a>  Or, more preferably, resigned from parliament. There would be a lot of people happy about that, Senator Smith—I think you are right. This is a man who has done so much damage to the agricultural sector. I am really disappointed that the minister who had the courage to resign over the recent change in leadership and stick to it was pushed aside so many times by the government and was not able to deal with some of the impositions of Minister Burke into the agricultural portfolio. Minister Burke set a whole heap of this up when he was minister between 2007 and 2010. He is the minister who did not even leave a policy for agriculture at the 2010 election. He is the minister who set up the harvest strategy in the small pelagic fishery, inviting companies to bring vessels into that fishery and then, when there was a ruckus kicked up, changed the law to send them away—that is now in court. The judge has described that legislation as poorly drafted. That is the record of Minister Burke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is Minister Burke who has driven the destruction of the forest industry in my home state of Tasmania. He is one of the early architects of this legislation. In Tasmania this government is spending $100 million at the moment on a slush fund for the next election to shut down an industry. This government talks about jobs. It is spending taxpayers' money to shut industry down, and that is also the effect of this sort of legislation, which adds red tape, green tape and cost. It is expending, in this case, industry funds to make them less competitive, and that is why we object to this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation went through two inquiries, one in the House of Representatives and one in the Senate, something that does not often happen, I have to say. In both houses there was concern about particularly the reregistration process in this piece of legislation. That is where the additional cost comes. That is where the attack on the availability of agricultural and veterinary chemicals comes as part of this bill. And that is what concerns the opposition about this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also why we are disappointed that only 25 minutes has been given to the debate on this. There are a number of people with particular expertise on this piece of legislation. Senator Back in particular, an experienced veterinarian with real concerns around the design of this piece of legislation, will not get the opportunity to speak on this piece of legislation because of the gag—the gag that has put 55 pieces of legislation through this house in just a week. And yet it does not seem to be too much of a problem for this government, which complained bitterly about 32 gags in the entire Howard government of 2004 to 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation adds over 200 new pages of regulation and removes none. When you look at the approach that the coalition is taking versus the approach that the government is taking to regulation and red tape in this country, it exposes quite clearly the difference between the two. Over 20,000 new regulations have been imposed by this government. The opposition has a commitment to reduce red tape and regulation by a billion dollars a year. Yet this government still does not get the message. It still does not have the connection that people in the community and business are crying out for government to get out of their way and reduce the regulatory burden. I am not sure how many regulations the government has actually reduced or has actually taken away, but I reckon you could probably count them on one hand, and yet it has put 20,000-plus in place. Our commitment is to remove the regulatory burden, and our commitment is to make it easier for business and less costly for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of this bill, one other thing that really concerns us is the capacity of campaigns to add cost. We have seen how, particularly in the case of the live export debacle that the government created, when a few emails start rolling in the door, they react. They do not sit down and assess. They closed the live export trade to Indonesia. We know that the new Prime Minister, Prime Minister Rudd, was then foreign minister and was telling the Indonesian foreign minister that everything was okay: 'It'll be okay. It'll be all right. We'll negotiate with you. We'll sort something out.' The cabinet back here in Australia were of a different mind. They made a decision to ban the trade the following day. Prime Minister Rudd, then foreign minister, was not aware of it. The Indonesians heard about it on the radio. So we know what the potential effect of campaigns can be, particularly with the Labor Party dependent on the Greens in power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The capacity under this piece of legislation for campaigns to escalate from what the government tries to assure us is going to be a low-level cost for the re-registration cycle of chemicals to become something that is much, much more expensive, and that requires full documentation, is of real concern to the coalition. It is of real concern to industry because they have seen the effect of GetUp! style campaigns, particularly on the Labor Party, and being driven by the Greens—the Labor Party's coalition partner that has been so destructive for this country and particularly for my and Senator Bushby's home state of Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The negative impact on Tasmania of the Labor-Green accords at a state and federal level has been absolutely devastating. Our economy is going backwards. Our unemployment is way above the national average. Why would we not be concerned about the potential for more of the destructive type campaign that we have seen impact on our home state to be embedded into the process with another piece of legislation such as this? Because we know how the Labor Party is prepared to succumb. And so we oppose that approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are more than happy and, in fact, we are determined that agricultural and veterinary chemicals that are utilised in this country be safe. We are determined that there be a strong regulatory regime, but we do not want to overdo it. We do not want to hand it to the GetUp! style campaigns so that all you have to do is press a button, perhaps not even knowing that you are sending an email to a campaign type set-up and adding to a perceived level of concern to the community over that process. These processes need to be rigorous. They need to look at all of the data, but we do not need to overdo the process. We do not need to bring in additional regulations because a small group decide that that is what we ought to do. We have a strong record in this country and we need to ensure that our regulators do the work that is required of them. It is important for the efficacy of agriculture that we have a strong regime of agricultural and veterinary chemical registration in this country. I do not think that there is anybody who would disagree with that. But we do not need to overburden industry in this country with costs. We are already—and it is widely acknowledged—high-cost producers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why continue to add and layer additional costs where it is not necessary? Why continue to put in place the capacity for campaign type systems when we know that is the way that the Labor Party and the Greens react? Let us have a sensible and strong regulatory regime, but let us not overdo it. Let us not put in place processes and regulations that add millions of dollars a year to the cost, but require, in the case of the campaign, to go back and to go back and to go back.

                    </a>  The Greens believe that Australians should have access to the safest and smartest methods and chemicals available for pest management in their homes and gardens and, in particular, for the production of the nation's food. However, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority has never had the proper legislative triggers it needs to systematically review and quickly remove highly hazardous and unmanageable pesticides from the market, making way for safer pesticides.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia still allows highly hazardous pesticides banned in other countries. It permits pesticides to be used in our food that are known to cause cancer and mutations. It allows pesticides that cause reproductive damage and long-living pesticides that build up in the environment and in wildlife, where they cause damage. The APVMA is one of the last regulators in the world to recognise that, for example, the insecticide Endosulfan was unmanageable, despite all of the scientific evidence clearly labelled for it. Endosulfan is now listed on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and is banned globally. It will take years before its residues disappear from our bodies and the environment. The authority to date has taken an ad hoc approach to chemical review. There is no rationale for what ends up on the chemical review list. We believe these changes are necessary. You should not continue to have on the list a pesticide that is a known carcinogen.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SINODINOS:</span>
                    </a>  The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Bill 2013 proposes to replace the existing model for Commonwealth financial management established through the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1987—the FMA Act—and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997—the CAC Act. It would consolidate under one piece of legislation the governance, performance and accountability requirements for the Commonwealth and relevant entities, which are covered currently under both the FMA and CAC acts. The bill would introduce a new framework for the finances of the Commonwealth, impacting on some 195 entities and around 300,000 individuals who work with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is not a reform to be taken lightly or a reform to be driven by undue haste. Yet, in the dying days of this parliament—for the benefit of those in the gallery—we are being asked to approve a complex bill on which we are provided with a framework but no rules as to how the bill will actually impact, in practice, on the operation of Commonwealth entities. We are talking about entities that cover the management and accountability for revenue and expenses of over $350 billion—that is your money, taxpayers' money—as well as assets of over $390 billion, which are your assets, and liabilities of over $640 billion—liabilities that we have rung up in your name. This type of reform is precisely the sort of reform that should be covered by a new parliament regardless of its colour or stripe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most appropriately, this bill has been subject to an inquiry by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. Two fundamental concerns have been identified: the lack of detail as to how the new financial framework would actually be applied, and the unnecessary haste with which it is being brought before this parliament and the need for additional consultation. One of the great problems that this government has had and one of the reasons their governance and their policy process has been so fraught and so mistaken is that they have not consulted properly with stakeholders, business, the private sector, non-profit groups and the community on important pieces of reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The major issues the bill largely represents are the direction and principles of reform, with much of the detail to be set out in future rules tailored for individual entities. We agree with the broad principles behind the bill; they are not objectionable. The Commonwealth should operate as a coherent whole. These are public resources, and a common set of duties should apply to all resources handled by Commonwealth entities. Performance of the public sector is about more than the finances. And engaging responsibly with risk and managing risk is a necessary step in improving performance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that the current framework is pretty complex and fragmented, so reform is needed. A single act would, as far as practicable, apply a consistent set of principles based on a framework for all Commonwealth entities. It should also be compatible with specific enabling legislation which mandates the establishment and functions of public entities. There is greater emphasis, appropriately, on risk management, something that is said to be deficient in the existing framework. This should be applied in a way that accommodates both autonomy and personal responsibility, and that would be welcomed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill seeks to bring about cultural change by placing a duty on entities to establish their own appropriate systems of risk oversight and management and by introducing the principle of earned autonomy. You can earn lesser oversight if you have a track record of dealing well with risk. This would draw on the better-practice principles for regulators identified by the Productivity Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing framework—the one that we are seeking to replace—is also described as very linear and focused on straight lines of vertical authority, which create hurdles to what we call citizen-centric service delivery. In other words, there are too many silos in government dealing with services that go to you as a whole person. This is something that is important for policy in the future to recognise so that it is less fragmented and less complex for Australian citizens to navigate in getting services out of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this is objectionable. But what is objectionable is not knowing how, or if, these principles will in fact be satisfactorily applied. This detail will only be revealed in a specific set of rules, the legislative implements, which is yet to be drafted let alone sighted. The general consensus is that this will be developed over 12 months. What the bill does afford is quite substantial power and discretion for the finance minister, under sections 101 to 105, to make rules necessary or convenient to be prescribed in carrying out, or giving effect to, this act. And the government has agreed to subject these future instruments to the scrutiny of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as it should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe the draft rules should have been prepared for public exposure so that there would be consultation. We have until 1 July 2014. There is time to do this properly. There is no need to rush the process. The Auditor-General, Ian McPhee, told the recent Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit inquiry that he would be more comfortable with this legislation if the bill had been subject to a more open exposure process given the number of entities and officials affected by it and because of the fundamental importance of the legislation, as indicated earlier. He said: 'We also have no visibility of the complementary rules which, together with the legislation, will establish the Commonwealth's financial management framework and contribute significantly to it. So our support for the legislation is more measured than it may have been under different circumstances and with more time.' That is the Auditor-General, the chief auditor to the Commonwealth, putting up not an amber light or a green light but a red light and saying let us consider this further, let us consider this properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His views were supported by the Australian Public Service Commissioner and even the Chief Operating Officer of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation—no friend of some on this side of the House—who said: 'I guess the reservation we have about the haste is around clarity on the rules that sit underneath the legislation and the detail that flows with them. That would be our one caution around the timing and haste of this.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a series of people, not necessarily partisan individuals—I do not know how some of them vote but in a couple of cases they are statutory officers—and they are saying we need more time. In conclusion, delay seems prudent given the lack of imperative for this bill to be passed by this parliament. If it is not passed, nothing will change. It will be business as usual and the entities covered under the existing framework will continue to function without any negative impact on taxpayers and the broader community. It is for these reasons that the coalition stands opposed to the Public Governance Performance and Accountability Bill 2013 in its current form.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I am sure that people in the gallery this morning and those who are listening to the broadcast would agree that there is nothing more important in the management of our political affairs than how we look after taxpayers' money. In the current context people might want to add to that calling an election and defending the Constitution, but broadly speaking no-one would argue that there is a task more important in government than that of protecting taxpayers' money. So it is worth reflecting briefly on why it is that the Australian Greens are going to support the government, not the coalition, when it comes to the prudent financial management of taxpayers' money. That is worth reflecting on. The Australian Greens talk about transparency and open democracy but when the rubber hits the ground they vote with Labor. They do not vote with the prudent financial managers, the coalition; they vote with Labor. So there is a lot of talk but very little action from the Australian Greens when it comes to the proper management of taxpayers' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is worth reflecting on two critical points. What Senator Sinodinos says is right: the two most trusted people in the Australian bureaucracy—the Public Service Commissioner and the Auditor-General—have said stop, do not proceed any further with this reform. Instead, the government in its wisdom, supported by the Australian Greens, is going full steam ahead. It is worth reflecting on what the Auditor-General said. He said, 'We would feel more comfortable with this legislation if the bill had been subject to a more open process given the number of entities and officials affected by it and because of the fundamental importance of this legislation.' It is worth reflecting on what the Auditor-General said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say during the Senate estimates process:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some more time for consultation in respect of the draft bill would have been, I think, helpful to increase the awareness of the proposals within it and to bring everyone on board with the new approach. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HDA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  Another day and another three Labor Party taxation bills which this arrogant government wants to arrogantly push through the Senate with just half an hour of debate. Normally each one of these bills—the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 1) Bill 2013, the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 and the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 3) Bill 2013—would have a substantial debate in its own right, each one of these bills would be subject to the proper scrutiny of the Senate and each one of these bills would be properly fleshed out so that all of us could be in a position to make a considered and well-informed judgement about whether proceeding with it was in our national interest or not. But, while this government may have changed its leader, it is still the same old dysfunctional, divided, chaotic, incompetent and arrogant government as it was before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our new Prime Minister has a very bad track record when it comes to tax, because the reckless, wasteful spending and the massive debt and deficits started under the former Prime Minister, now the new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. I think it is worth the Senate's remembering what Prime Minister Rudd was like in his first iteration as Prime Minister of Australia. He promised the Australian people back in 2007 that he would be an economic conservative, that he would be a mini John Howard. He was trying to tell people that it would be safe for them to change from John Howard to him because essentially he would just continue the sensible, sound fiscal management that had occurred for 12 years under the previous government with Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello. But, of course, the wasteful spending got underway immediately. The new taxes got underway immediately. The massive new debt and deficits got underway immediately. That was one of the immediate broken promises from this government in its original iteration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to remember that the Labor Party in 2007 inherited a very strong budget position. They inherited a budget with no government net debt. They inherited a budget with a $20 billion surplus. They inherited a budget with $70 billion worth of Commonwealth net assets. Prime Minister Rudd, in his first iteration as Prime Minister, immediately turned that situation around, delivering $129 billion worth of accumulated deficits on his watch. On Prime Minister Rudd's first watch as Prime Minister, he spent $129 billion more than he raised in revenue. That was despite the best terms of trade in 140 years. That was despite 12 new or increased Labor Party taxes, on Kevin Rudd's first watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember his first tax grab—the alcopops tax? The alcopops tax was a 70 per cent increase in tax on ready-to-drink beverages that was going to stop binge drinking by young girls, we were told. But that was just the spin. That is the spin we were getting from Prime Minister Rudd then because, while he was telling people that the 70 per cent increase from the alcopops tax was going to stop binge drinking, Treasury on the quiet was assuming that the consumption of alcopops would go up, but all of the revenue estimates from the increase in the alcopops tax were based on an expectation that consumption would actually go up and not down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the increase in the luxury car tax. I well remember listening to then Prime Minister Rudd, the now recycled Prime Minister Rudd, saying that this would be a tax which would hit Maserati drivers, Porsche drivers and Rolls-Royce drivers. He was making the argument, 'Why shouldn't the Rolls-Royce drivers across Australia pay more tax?' But when you look beyond the spin, when you look at the detail, when you look at the facts, what you realise very quickly is that overwhelmingly the increased revenue was expected to come from families across Australia that were buying a new family station wagon. Their rhetoric never reflects what they do in practice, and Prime Minister Rudd has that sort of track record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the massive increases in taxes on superannuation which started under Prime Minister Rudd in his first iteration, after he promised in the lead-up to the 2007 election that there would be no changes to superannuation. In his own peculiar language, he put some colour around the promise when he made it. He said they would not make any changes to superannuation—'not one jot, not one tittle.' That was the language used by the then Prime Minister Rudd and the now recycled Prime Minister Rudd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had increased tax targeting people who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance. Again, in the lead-up to the 2007 election, the then leader of the parliamentary Labor Party in opposition, Mr Rudd, promised not to make any changes to private health insurance arrangements. He was not going to make any change to the tax rebate that was a valued incentive for those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance, but on coming into government he broke that promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Prime Minister Rudd in his original iteration who initiated Labor's failed mining tax. Yes, he had a then trusted sidekick by his side, former Treasurer Swan. But it was then Prime Minister Rudd in his first iteration who went out with a tax which was so bad that he lost his job over it. Here we go again: the Labor Party is now recycling it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that under then Prime Minister Rudd there were so many new taxes? Why is it that under then Prime Minister Rudd the government were not able to balance the books even though they had the best terms of trade in 140 years, even though they inherited a very strong budget position from the previous government and even though they had introduced 12 new or increased taxes? The reason they could not balance the books was that they wasted too much money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember Mr Rudd's efforts in his first iteration as Prime Minister when he sought to stimulate the economy by sending $900 cheques to dead people? He sought to stimulate the economy by forcing people to put pink batts into their roofs and, after 50 per cent of the money had been allocated, he spent the next 50 per cent of the money taking the batts out of roofs because houses started burning down. Remember all of the waste and mismanagement with all of the money that was thrown at the overpriced school halls under Mr Rudd, the now recycled Labor Prime Minister, in his first iteration as Labor Prime Minister—waste and mismanagement everywhere?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course that is why the Labor government, whether under Mr Rudd, Ms Gillard or the recycled Mr Rudd, are not able to live within their means. They have to come up with one new tax grab after the other. They have to ram them through with their partners in crime, the Australian Greens political party, in order to create some sort of semblance that they are trying to get back onto a proper, more responsible track. Of course, in every budget they promise that they are on their way back to a surplus. They promise that the surplus is there in the distance somewhere and say, 'We've got our pathway to get there,' but, as you get closer to it, the budget position keeps on deteriorating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to some comments yesterday where Prime Minister Rudd was trying to perpetuate the dishonest myth of a $70 billion black hole in the coalition's budget figures. Let me just say: there is no $70 billion coalition black hole, but there is a $220 billion black hole that we can all see in the budget papers under the Rudd-Gillard governments. After six years of Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, there is a $220 billion budget black hole and it is growing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at every budget from budget to budget, you can see that whatever we are promised at budget time is thrown overboard by Christmas. Whatever numbers we are promised at budget time are no longer worth the paper they are written on, probably before Christmas, and usually just before Christmas is when they fess up to it, when they think nobody is watching and everybody is focused on other things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just look at Labor's track record since the last election. In the lead-up to the last election, the former Treasurer quite dishonestly sought to make people believe that in 2011-12 the budget deficit would be just $10 billion. He provided this economic update to pre-empt the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which is released by the secretaries of Treasury and Finance once the election has been called. So he promised that the deficit in 2011-12 would be just $10 billion. Guess what: 2011-12 is the final year for which we have a final budget outcome. I am sure, Madam Acting Deputy President, that you would be as astonished as I was to realise that the actual deficit for 2011-12 was $43.7 billion in the final budget outcome. That is a budget deterioration in just one financial year of more than $30 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, in 2012-13 we are on track for a budget deterioration from what was promised at budget time to what is emerging at the end of the financial year of $20 billion. We have had a budget deterioration from what was promised to what is being delivered of more than $50 billion under Labor for just two years. This is a situation which started under Prime Minister Rudd in his original iteration, which continued and accelerated under Prime Minister Gillard and which will only get worse under Prime Minister Rudd recycled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way we are going to get our finances back under control, the only way we are going to get our budget back under control, is by achieving a change of government at election time, whenever that might be. Let me just note here that there was much wrong with government under Prime Minister Gillard. There was much uncertainty, much chaos, much dysfunction, much division and much incompetence. But at least the Australian people had some certainty about when the election would be. Now Prime Minister Rudd, recycled, has even taken that certainty away from the Australian people. He did not even want people to have any certainty in relation to the election date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are: another day, another three Labor Party tax bills which the government wants to ram through the parliament. These are not insignificant issues. In fact, on one of the bills, the government has now totally rolled over to the coalition perspective on it. It is in relation to the changes to the Tax Agent Services Act, where the government wants to bring financial advisers into the framework of the Tax Agent Services Act. The government wanted to ram this through the House of Representatives a couple of weeks ago. It wanted to ram it through the House of Representatives without even having an inquiry. Only because the Independents on this occasion agreed with our view that that was completely inappropriate, completely outrageous, were we able to enforce an inquiry. There would not have been an inquiry and there would not have been any amendments if we had not been able to convince the Independents in the House of Representatives to do the right thing on this occasion. And what has happened since? The government totally rolled over—totally, 100 per cent, rolled over—by adopting our position when it comes to the changes to the Tax Agent Services Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said that it was unreasonable to impose a massive change in regulatory arrangements on financial advisers by putting them into the tax agent services regime from 1 July 2013 with less than a week—with just two or three days to go now—before that would have come into effect. We said that there should be an extension in the implementation date to 1 July 2014. We said that there should be an extension to the current exemption for financial advisers from the Tax Agent Services Act. We said that there needed to be some clarification around the scope of financial tax advice in the legislation. We said a whole range of other things. The government adopted, holus-bolus, all of our recommendations, but it would never have come to this. This bill would never have been improved if the government had got its way in ramming things through the House of Representatives the way it is trying to ram things through the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that that is okay for schedules 3 and 4 of the original Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013, but there was no proper inquiry in relation to schedule 5. Schedule 5 is an extraordinary schedule. It essentially seeks to increase the level of disclosure of tax arrangements in relation to individual corporate taxpayers. The genesis of this is politics. The genesis of this is that former Treasurer Wayne Swan was so embarrassed about the failure of his complex and bad mining tax, which everybody knew had not raised any meaningful revenue, and he was so desperate to keep the revenue figure in relation to the mining tax secret that he tried to hide behind the confidentiality provisions of our tax laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the matter—and everybody in the Treasurer's office knows that this is true—is that there was nothing and there is nothing in the tax laws now that prevented the Treasurer from releasing information about mining tax revenue collections in aggregate at that time. Indeed, the Senate passed an order of the Senate ordering the Commissioner of Taxation to release that information, and the tax commissioner was about to provide that information to the Senate and indeed eventually did provide that information to the Senate. The only reason Wayne Swan eventually went public was to fess up that the mining tax, which he had predicted would raise $4 billion this financial year in net revenue, had raised just $126 million in gross revenue over its first two quarters. He went out because he could. When he was trying to run this line that somehow he was stopped by confidentiality provisions in our tax laws, that was just an excuse. He wanted people to believe that he could come up with a new tax, he could make predictions on how much it could raise and he could spend all of the money that he thought it would raise. But then, when the tax had actually come into effect, he was not able to tell people whether it had, in fact, raised what he had predicted it would raise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was always a ridiculous proposition. This suggestion, that he would go to jail if somebody told him what the information was, was just completely ludicrous. But this bill—the changes in schedule 5 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013—is essentially his effort to keep that illusion of that excuse alive, by going completely overboard in terms of making changes that are not required for taxpayer confidentiality arrangements or tax disclosure arrangements in relation to individual corporate taxpayers, because he wanted to continue to keep that illusion of his excuse alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, if Mr Rudd and Mr Bowen wanted to demonstrate that there had been any change in direction under the current government, they should have immediately pulled this very bad, very outrageous, inadequately scrutinised and inadequately thought-through tax bill—which imposes excessive and inappropriate disclosure arrangements on individual taxpayers in relation to individual taxpayer information. But I suspect that they are so distracted with all of the other Labor Party shenanigans and so focused on trying to stay on top of the civil war that rages inside the Labor Party that they probably have not had time to turn their minds to Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 in the Senate—which is a real shame, because this is bad legislation. It is against our national interests. It is ill thought out. It was 100 per cent political. It was all about a bad Treasurer trying to cover his backside. Our economy is going to be worse off for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that this debate is now about to come to a close and we have only 10 minutes left to talk about all of the measures in these bills is just completely inappropriate. But it just shows that the Labor Party may change their leader but they have not changed direction. They are still the same chaotic, dysfunctional, divided, incompetent and arrogant Labor Party that they were before. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I say this more in sorrow than in anger, but—yet again—we have another bill that is going to be rammed through without adequate scrutiny. We had amendments last night to the Fair Work legislation, which one of the architects of the Fair Work legislation—Professor Andrew Stewart, from the University of Adelaide—expressed serious concerns about. There was no committee stage for that bill. There was no appropriate scrutiny. Who knows what chaos will ensue from the provisions of that bill for both employees and employers alike around the country?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have a bill that is being rammed through. My contribution will be less than five minutes, because we only have another 11 minutes for the entire debate, to allow other senators to contribute. What has happened here this week is a disgrace. It is absolutely appalling that the house of review has been reduced to a rubber stamp. We have a situation where we cannot have any amendments being passed by this place, because—if we do—the House of Representatives has got up for the winter session.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator XENOPHON:</span>
                  </a>  Senator Cormann says that we should. I take that interjection, because we should. We are meant to be a house of review. We will not have any committee stage to go through these issues. What beggars belief and what I cannot get my head around is that my colleagues the Australian Greens—who I have had a good and respectful working relationship with for a number of years now—have voted for this. I do not get it. I just do not get why they have gone down this path. It completely contradicts what Senator Bob Brown said back in 2005, during the Howard government, when they used the guillotine. But the Howard government, when they used the guillotine, were amateurs compared to what we have seen right here this week. This is disgusting. It is nothing short of disgusting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let me go to this bill. I would like to indicate my support for measures in this bill; however, I believe they need to go further. I have circulated an amendment to this bill in response to concerns from Australian subcontractors. I am grateful to the member for New England, Tony Windsor MP, whose office approached me in relation to this, because it is a legitimate concern about contractors being left in the lurch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen examples in recent times where companies that have won government tenders have left smaller subcontractors high and dry. These small Australian businesses deserve to know that companies that are awarded contracts are financially sound and able to meet their commitments. The amendment that I have moved would allow the minister to request certain tax information regarding a company, for the purpose of determining its financial situation. The minister will be able to release this information for the purpose of demonstrating the financial stability or otherwise of the company in question. I acknowledge that the government and the member for New England, Tony Windsor MP, have had extensive discussions about this issue. I was very pleased to take up Mr Windsor's concerns in relation to this, and I am grateful that he entrusted me with this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has had extensive discussions with the Assistant Treasurer's office, who expressed their support for this issue, if not for my amendment. I now have a letter, which I have shown to the whips of the parties present in the chamber, that I seek leave to table. It is from the Hon. David Bradbury MP, Assistant Treasurer. It is undated but it has just been provided to my office. I seek leave to table a true copy of this letter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8IV" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator XENOPHON:</span>
                  </a>  I indicate that the Assistant Treasurer makes the point that the House of Representatives has concluded for this winter sitting. He says, 'This means it would not be feasible for any parliamentary amendments made in the Senate to be considered by the House of Representatives'—the point that Senator Cormann made earlier, in that very helpful interjection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the best I can do, short of an amendment, is to get the undertakings from the Assistant Treasurer in relation to this. So I will not be proceeding with my amendment as a result of the undertakings given by the Assistant Treasurer, for which I am grateful. The Assistant Treasurer has stated that this issue—the disclosure of information—will be on the agenda for a meeting between the ATO, ASIC and APRA as part of a series of meetings, and that this matter needs to be resolved. The Assistant Treasurer has also indicated the government's broad support for a Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into further support for subcontractors in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once we are back after the election—my hot tip is that it will be on 21 September, but as you know I do not gamble so I will not be taking any bets—it is important that the Senate economics committee look at this issue so that we can deal with it comprehensively. I am grateful for the undertaking by the Assistant Treasurer, which has now been tabled, so I will not be proceeding with my amendments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I say again: for goodness sake, let's never, ever do this again. Let's never, ever see a situation where 55 bills have been rammed through and where decent scrutiny has been completely abrogated. It has made a travesty of the parliamentary process. This is appalling. Every Australian should be concerned about this. If I am ever in a position where my vote would count on this—if I am re-elected in a few weeks time; if the people of South Australia entrust me with being in the Senate again—I tell both sides and my friends on the crossbenches that I will never be party to something like this ever again. What we have seen this week is completely and utterly disgusting.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I, too, rise to speak to these tax bills. As Senator Xenophon has very clearly articulated, the people of Australia should be deeply concerned by the process, the substance and the promise of what these bills mean for Australia. Senator Xenophon and my colleagues have highlighted the process. We have seen, this week, 55 bills rammed through by the Greens-Labor alliance. In the whole three years when the Howard government controlled the Senate there were 32. In the time that the Greens-Labor alliance has controlled this place there have been well over 200. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who are listening to this broadcast, the consequence of this process being applied is that due diligence is not performed </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee stage, which is the stage where—unlike in second reading debates both in the House and here—senators can go through legislation line by line and question the minister time and again to expose unintended consequences, is absent. So this house of review, which is meant to ensure states' rights and to make sure that legislation has due diligence applied, has been cut out of the process by this government in its dying days. The substance of the bills is broad, and it should be deeply concerning to people that there is no due diligence being applied.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill, which appears to be a minor issue in terms of the monthly PAYG instalments, that was not introduced for any good policy reason. That was not introduced to try and support small business or make things more effective. That was introduced because the government hoped to claw back money over the forward estimates in their failed attempt to deliver a budget surplus. So pure politics drove that. Pure politics has made life harder for small business. Small business is what generates jobs in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen that approach by the government—driven by short-term, poll-driven politics—not only result in them changing prime ministers twice but impact on small business, jobs and things like defence. We have seen exactly the same approach in the Department of Defence at estimates. The department have admitted on the public record that the government's drive for a budget surplus has caused them to make decisions that are not in the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a government that can be trusted for Australia's future, either for our children in terms of jobs, for the economy, for national security or even for things like the incentives—things that theoretically should be good. Here one of the schedules is 'Incentives for designated infrastructure projects' to try and encourage private investment. In principle that sounds like a good thing, but the coalition has concerns about the extent of the discretion that is being given to the coordinator of infrastructure. We only have to look at the 'Bob Brown memorial trust' that was set up by this government—where they make arbitrary, ideological decisions as to where taxpayers' money will be allocated as opposed to scientifically based decisions with a good business case—for us to say, 'We have concerns.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the process that has been adopted by this Labor-Green alliance has cut out the opportunity for us to take the government to task on this line by line and to move amendments, as Senator Xenophon has highlighted. The fact that they are putting this through on the very last day of the sitting of this parliament, when the House of Representatives have already risen and gone, means that, even if we were given the opportunity to do due diligence and have a committee stage, there would be no point because no amendments would get up. So the Australian public will have to wear more wasted taxpayers' money, more bureaucracy and more things that will threaten equity and fairness in this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are coming into a period where the Australian people need to make a choice. There are lots of other measures here I could talk about in the bills, but in the one minute and 50 seconds I have remaining to talk about this it is important to talk about the impact of taxation. Taxation is about the government saying, 'We need a revenue base and we need to have spending for the public,' and we all understand that. But the thing that the public must choose when they choose a future government is who will spend that money wisely. They only have to look back over the last two groups of governments to understand the choice they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the Howard government, in 2007-08 there was a $19.8 billion surplus. In this year's budget there is an $18 billion deficit. Under the Howard government, in 2007-08 there was $44.8 billion in the bank. That is savings. That is what we teach our children to try to do. Under this government, there is $178 billion in debt, and they are on their way to $340 billion of national debt. Under the Howard government the banks and others were paying us interest—$1 billion a year in earnings. Under this government, there is $7.8 billion in interest payments alone. Imagine what that could do for building infrastructure, for giving incentives for jobs, for building a future for our children. When the people of Australia decide on the next government, remember these figures because they are the true indication of who you can trust with Australia's economy; who you can trust to set fair, equitable and effective tax rules; but, most importantly, who you can trust to be the adults who will spend your hard-earned taxpayer dollars wisely and effectively. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Asian Century) Bill 2013 is to expand the eligibility criteria for the OS-HELP Loan Scheme and to provide further incentives for students to pursue a course of study in Asia from 1 January 2014. In introducing the bill, the government has purported to implement the recommendations of the Asian century white paper, which was released, of course, in October 2012, to encourage closer ties between Australia and our Asia-Pacific neighbours—specifically, by providing incentives for Australian university students to complete part of their degrees overseas, particularly in our Asian region. According to the white paper this will enable more Australians to study overseas—it is a 'high priority', because Australians abroad are important conduits for building capabilities and exchanging ideas. Indeed, by pursuing overseas study our university students will continue to build the skills overseas that they will need to succeed in an increasingly competitive, knowledge-driven global economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am often reminded that when I was an undergraduate student—more than 30 years ago now—my competition for work really was those who lived in the same city as I did, and perhaps in the next city. That is where the competition for work would come from. But for today's young people—those undergraduates in our universities today—increasingly their competition comes from Berlin, Washington, London and Paris, and now of course from Beijing and Madras and cities in other developing countries. So the world has changed enormously in the last 30 years. That capacity to understand Asia—that Asia literacy—is very important not only for the capacity of our students but also for our nation as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expansion of OS-HELP eligibility criteria was recently endorsed in the International Education Advisory Council's report that is known as the Chaney report, as part of the promotion of student mobility in the Asia-Pacific. Additionally, in his address to the Asia Society in March of this year, James Packer made the following important observations:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The best way to build our relationship with China and for that matter Asia is through exchanges of people at every level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… exchanges build trust, understanding and long term friendships; they also help to break down ignorance and stereotypes that exist between our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are few better ways to forge Australia into China and the Asian Century than through student exchanges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a country we need to dramatically increase the number of Chinese and Asian students studying in Australian universities, the economic benefits are immense and so are the person to person contacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, while there are significant economic benefits to increased student mobility in the Asia-Pacific region—particularly when one considers that in the last financial year Australia's international education industry was worth almost $15 billion—our students cannot be viewed as just commodities or just statistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that regard, the tertiary sector is now pushing for the continuation of the third wave of international education, whereby countries are being encouraged to build a broader, more meaningful and longer-term conception of international education. This eventually may lead to greater integration of universities in our region, the growth of offshore campuses and ultimately the cross-accreditation of courses throughout Asia. The promotion of greater student mobility through the expansion of OS-HELP under the bill, aside from any increase in the value of our international education industry, is likely to, among other things, promote closer trade, diplomatic and cultural ties in our region; build a diverse and expansive network of people-to-people connections; and lead to the development of stronger, more collaborative international research and science linkages that will foster improved productivity and innovation here in Australia. These are important outcomes to the future of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment for inquiry. The committee reported in May this year and recommended the passage of this bill. The committee's report noted that the bill received strong support from stakeholders; none of the stakeholders objected to the measures. It also noted the view of some stakeholders, principally private education providers, that access to OS-HELP should be further extended to include students who are not in Commonwealth supported places—in other words, students attending private universities or other higher education establishments and fee-paying postgraduate students. The committee noted the submissions from Bond University and the Council of Private Higher Education and was of the view that consideration be given to extending the eligibility for OS-HELP assistance to non-Commonwealth-supported-place students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the committee did not look at the budgetary implications of such a measure or the technicalities involved in the change of policy. The Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education strongly reiterated the view that the primary purpose of OS-HELP is the support of students in Commonwealth supported places, not all students, and that OS-HELP should not be considered separately from the overall HECS-HELP student loan scheme, its policy intent and, indeed, its operation. At this point, however, the coalition believes that it is better to adopt a wait-and-see approach to OS-HELP—that is, to monitor the impact of the changes made by the bill, including any increased demand for overseas study opportunities, as a result of the exchanges and the associated costing implications, and to examine the further extension of OS-HELP to private students in the future, based on a considered assessment of the relevant policy issues. This approach was endorsed in the Chaney report that I referred to earlier. If the coalition is fortunate enough to form a government, it is already committed to revisiting the issue of student support and assistance through a thorough review of student payments and loans to ensure a fair, equitable and open system that is free of anomalies—for currently there are anomalies. Another look at OS-HELP could well form part of that review.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Encouraging the outward mobility of Australian university students, particularly to Asian countries, has been a key feature of the coalition's higher education policy since the last election. It is an important priority of a shadow minister for foreign affairs—Ms Julie Bishop. I must say, at a personal level, I believe one of the greatest experiences a young person can ever have is to study overseas. I was fortunate; I did, and it changed my life—indeed, it was probably the most enjoyable 18 months of my life. I worked occasionally but had a very good time and learnt a lot, not so much from the course I studied as from the peers I had. For any young Australian who is considering studying in Asia—or indeed anywhere overseas—I commend the experience. They may well see it, looking back 25 years later, as one of the greatest experiences of their life. So I commend that to any young Australian now listening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year the coalition held a policy development round table in conjunction with the Menzies Research Centre to develop further details of its New Colombo Plan initiative. This initiative is designed to provide government grants to students so they can access study and internship opportunities in the Asia-Pacific. As Ms Julie Bishop has said, it is anticipated that the New Colombo Plan will enable students to develop strong alumni networks with universities and industries in our region which they will be able to use in their ongoing careers; provide students with the skills and the diversity of experience and the cultural understanding they need to succeed in this the Asian century; and help our universities to strengthen their international research partnerships and better develop linkages with industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expansion of OS-HELP eligibility criteria aligns with the coalition's proposed New Colombo Plan policy agenda, and it does that by providing loan assistance to supplement planned government grants under the New Colombo Plan. The coalition announced the New Colombo Plan initiative well before the government's own somewhat ad hoc AsiaBound Grants Program that commenced operation in April of this year. To date stakeholders have raised a number of concerns about the AsiaBound program, including the exclusion from the program of university consortia and other private mobility firms that could make use of their extensive overseas contacts to arrange the very student study and internship opportunities that the AsiaBound program is intended to promote. Significantly, the coalition, unlike the government, recognises the broader implications, and indeed the opportunities, that an Asia-focused grant scheme will have by opening the door for a mutual quality based accreditation scheme in the future that may ultimately—I concede ultimately, certainly not for a little while yet—serve as an Asia-Pacific replication of the successful European Bologna Process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is significant legislation. It is a crucial component of Australia's future global integrated higher education framework, as well as Australia's broader social, trade and diplomatic relations with our Asia-Pacific neighbours. In light of the bill's strong synergies with the coalition's existing higher education and foreign affairs policy agenda, which is focused increasingly on encouraging growth and opportunity in the Asia-Pacific and fostering closer ties in our region, the coalition of course does not oppose it. But it is a great pity that there was not more time to discuss this bill. The government is quite right: we have to look at our engagement with Asia, and it is a very important debate—one that will shape the destiny of our country over the next few years in this the Asian century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my 14 years here in the Senate I have never seen the guillotine adopted with such rapaciousness as it has been in the last couple of weeks. I am informed that this week alone there have been 55 bills rushed through—1½ times more than under the coalition in its time with a majority in the chamber. It is a ruthless and arrogant use of political power. Already during the 43rd parliament—it has been a destructive and perhaps not edifying parliament—the guillotine motion has been used to push 216 bills through the Senate. I was here in those heady days when the coalition briefly, for three years, had control of the Senate. How many bills did the coalition push through when it had control of the Senate? It pushed through 32 bills—less than one-sixth of the number of bills pushed through by the Labor-Greens alliance. Even when we did guillotine, the debate was always much longer—often the debate would be for a full half a day, and in some cases a day and a half. The government's action has not helped the role of the Senate—in fact, it has undermined it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference between this place and the House of Representatives is stark. It is stark for this reason: this is not an executive rubber stamp. This chamber does not rubber stamp the executive. It never has and it never will, for two main reasons. Let me give you two great examples. Even when the coalition had a majority in the Senate, the committee system of this place, with chairmen from the coalition, on several occasions—because I was one of them—knocked back bills put forward by the House of Representatives, by the government. I am not suggesting we should do this all the time, but the point is that it is not unusual for coalition chairmen of Senate committees to knock back legislation from the House of Representatives put forward by their own executive. I did that in 2007 on privacy legislation, you may remember, Senator Sinodinos. I did it and, quite frankly, I have no regrets. Senator Payne, I remember, was Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee at the time; she chaired that committee brilliantly for years. I have got to say I did not always agree with her chairmanship, but I always, always respected the fact that she was prepared to stand up to the executive—of her own party!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When was the last time we saw anyone from this side ever chairing a committee in this place and going against the executive of their own party, going against the Prime Minister? When have we seen that in the last six years—ever? It is a pathetic performance. They never cross the floor because they cannot. There is this Stalinist, statist mindset where they have not even got the independence of thought, independence of succour, to actually say to the executive: 'We don't support this bill.' We did it so many times when we had a Senate majority. Senator Sinodinos will recall it. He may not have been very happy about it, but we did it, and I am pleased we did it. Otherwise, the executive, which runs the House of Representatives, will seek to run the Senate, and they should not be allowed to do that, even if it is our executive. The point is a very simple one. This chamber is different. It is not simply an extension of the House of Representatives and it is not a rubber stamp for the executive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another point. We are constantly lectured by the other side about how uncaring we are, that we do not care, that somehow we lack ethical sustenance. I am getting very tired of the moral vanity of Labor and the Greens. You imagine the moral vanity oozing from the Left in Australian politics, and yet subjecting this parliament—subjecting this Senate—to, what, 216 bills in the life of the 43rd Parliament, and having the hide to preach to us about ethical and parliamentary behaviour. Could you imagine that? We never did this in the Howard government when we had a majority. We never behaved like this at all. Not only can this lot never ever, ever have a chairman of a committee that will stand up to the executive—what a pathetic crowd!—they cannot have a chairman of a Senate committee that will stand up to the executive down the road here in the House of Representatives. We did it time and time and time again when we were in government and when we had a Senate majority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is worse than that. Not only do their Senate chairmen not have any guts, they have no courage. It is worse than that. This lot cannot cross the floor in any case. They never have been able to. There is this statist mindset where they have all got to vote as one. Then they come into this chamber and preach to us about fairness and about justice. It is absolutely pathetic and it is absolutely hypocritical. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me finish on this point. I would not mind a fair debate; I do not mind a fair debate on any issue, including this issue of the Asian century. But what I really object to is being lectured to by people who have no understanding of independence of mind—a party that has never had a committee chair oppose the executive and do the right thing and that has never had the guts to cross the floor.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  I very strongly support the Higher Education Support Amendment (Asian Century) Bill 2013 because I believe in the value of education exchanges with Asia—in bringing foreign students to Australia and helping our students go to Asian universities. Such interchanges, it is said, foster better relationships between people and countries, and I believe that is very true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My home capital city of Perth has long had educational links with the countries to our north—with Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong—and with countries as far away as the Middle East. From the 1930s and into the fifties and sixties, a couple of ships, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gorgon</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Charon</span>, used to sail between Singapore and Fremantle twice a year bringing students to Perth from what is now Malaysia and taking them back at Christmas. That is why, among other reasons, Perth has such a close connection with South-East Asia. Since the 1930s, people have gone to school with Chinese and Malay students and have developed strong links which have continued after school as business and professional links.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In modern times, I have seen this from the other side. In 2003, as part of a delegation to Indonesia, I attended a meeting in Surabaya of the Australian alumni association, which included people who had come to Australia under the Colombo Plan in the 1950s all the way up to recent graduates from universities in Australia. The value of this kind of exchange was shown by the depth of knowledge they had about Australia and Australian affairs. The impressions of Australia they had were good and this helps to build good relationships. I was told at that meeting in Surabaya that at that time there were four graduates of Australian universities in the Indonesian cabinet. That is a marvellous outcome from the perspective of building understanding and helping Australia to be accepted as part of the Asian region.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Mason alluded to, the coalition, in its policies for this election, does have a program of proposed student exchanges with various Asian universities. I think that will go a long way towards building very important bridges between students at our universities and young people in Asia. Over the time ahead, I believe that will pay marvellous dividends in international cooperation.</span>

Again, what a shame it is that the debate is being truncated, but we have come to expect that in the last fortnight. I will focus for a few moments on the benefits to Australia—and, indeed, to the region—of a program such as this one. It is an excellent program, which I support, noting that it was copied from the coalition. I compliment our deputy leader, Ms Bishop, for her activity in this area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are tremendous benefits from this program, not the least of which are, as Senator Eggleston has mentioned, closer trade, diplomatic and cultural ties. But the other big benefit, which is often overlooked, is the enormous boost to tourism that occurs as a result of overseas students coming here. It is the catalyst for their family members, extended families and friends to come and visit Australia. Should those people be young, they themselves, in their turn, encourage others to come. I have employed many young Asians in businesses that I have run in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, and the fact that they have studied at Curtin University in Western Australia, the University of Western Australia or Edith Cowan University forges great links for the future between our state, our country and the countries in that region.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Supporting More Australians into Work) Bill 2013. This bill seeks to amend the Social Security Act 1991 to provide additional support to single parents who are transitioning to work or undertaking study to improve their opportunities for employment. The bill also seeks to provide unemployed Australians with the opportunity to earn more before their income support payment is affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments represent the government's response to ongoing criticism in relation to its decision to change the eligibility requirements for grandfathered recipients of the parenting payment, which affected the household budgets of 80,000 single parents by moving them on to the lower paying Newstart payment. Those grandfathered recipients under the former arrangements existed as a result of the coalition's reforms to social security in 2005-06. Under the coalition's changes, to qualify for the parenting payment a recipient's youngest child had to be under the age of eight, which was lowered from the previous age of 16. The previous coalition government introduced this reform in a fair and I think responsible manner. Under the coalition, recipients of the parenting payment were left in the system on the understanding that, over time, when their youngest child turned 16 they would naturally move out of the system. For people who had not had a child at that stage but who were coming into the system the changes were made that when their youngest child turned eight they would move from the parenting payment to Newstart. The coalition's approach provided notice and certainty to all parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That approach is in contrast to the changes made by the current government to the parenting payment, which, as I mentioned, affected the budgets of 80,000 single parents and saw uncertainty. It is always a problem when a government has mismanaged their budget and is desperate to look for savings. It prevents the government of the day from providing the usual period of notice to enable recipients to make adjustments over time. It is never good when a government is forced to act in order to seek desperately to balance a budget or to return a budget to surplus. That did not actually end up happening, but it is never good when a government is forced to act rather than plan carefully and thoughtfully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is before us is in effect the government's solution, or response, to the criticism that it has received. The bill has three measures. The first measure increases the income-free area that applies for recipients of Newstart allowance, widow allowance, partner allowance, parenting payment partnered and sickness allowance from 20 March 2014. The income-free area is the amount of ordinary income that an income-support recipient is able to earn in a fortnight before their payment rate is increased. The income-free area for these payments will increase from $62 to $100 per fortnight. The income-free area will also be indexed to the CPI from 1 July 2015, and this measure will give recipients the opportunity to earn more money before their payment rate is affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure of this bill extends the eligibility for the pensioner education supplement to single principal carer parents receiving Newstart allowance payments. This extension will begin on 1 January 2014 and will be available to eligible single principal carer parents undertaking approved education and training courses. The pensioner education supplement is paid at the current full rate of $62.40 per fortnight or the current concessional rate of $31.20 per fortnight depending on a person's study load.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third measure, commencing from 1 January next year, extends the eligibility for the pensioner concession card by 12 weeks to single parents who no longer qualify for the parenting payment single because their youngest child has turned eight years of age and they do not qualify for another income support payment due to earnings from employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concession cards provide a range of concessions to holders for services at the Commonwealth, state and local government levels including medical services, transport, telephone, utilities and rates. Consistent with current arrangements, a person would remain qualified for the concession card until the extension period of 12 weeks expired, the person died, moved permanently overseas or they started to receive an income support payment for which a concession card is eligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These proposed measures, as I said, are intended to address some of the criticisms that the government has received in relation to the decisions that they have taken. We know that when a government does not follow good process and when a government does not take the time to plan, the public are not provided with the opportunity to adjust and plan themselves. What the public look for in a government is predictability and some certainty. The public, quite naturally, do not like a government that is forever chopping and changing policy, where the people do not know from one day to the next whether the arrangements which they currently assume will continue into the future will in fact continue. We have seen this in any number of areas, whether they be superannuation, social security policy, taxation in relation to the mining industry or taxation of carbon, for instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is very little certainly under this government. That means that businesses have difficulty planning for the future; they will put hiring decisions on hold—and are putting hiring decisions on hold—and will put investment decisions on hold—and are, because they are waiting for what they hope will be the certainty provided after the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same is true for individual households, which have no sense of confidence that government policies which are in place will continue in the form that they are currently in. Households are worried about cost-of-living pressures and are putting spending decisions on hold because they want to conserve their resources for fear that this current government will unexpectedly change policy in some way that will affect their household budgets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation that is before us today is an attempt to address an example of that: single parent families who were operating on one set of assumptions and the government unexpectedly changed those assumptions. That is not the way to govern a nation, Mr Deputy President, and I think you know that one of the things that this side of the chamber will be offering at the next election is a 'no surprises' approach. If we are to be successful at the next election, we will offer the Australian public and business a 'no surprises' approach. We want there to be a degree of certainty. We want the public to have a sense of the arc in which a coalition government would operate. That allows businesses to plan for the future and it allows householders to plan for their futures without the zigzag and abrupt changes in policy which we have seen all too often under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, I should indicate that the opposition will not be opposing this legislation. So often, this side of the chamber has found itself in a position where there are decisions that we might not have made had we been in government because we would have had a different starting point. We would have handled the nation's budget very differently over the last six years had we been in office. But we do find ourselves, time and again, having to accept the facts as they are even though we wish they were otherwise and would have handled things differently and taken different decisions ourselves. So, with those remarks, I indicate that the opposition will not be opposing this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Supporting More Australians into Work) Bill 2013. The Greens will be supporting this legislation. However, we are deeply disappointed that this legislation does not go further. The individual measures in this bill have been welcomed by the community and the Australian Greens. However, as I said, it remains a disappointing demonstration of the government's failure to fully grasp the real needs of people trying to survive on Newstart or Youth Allowance. They just fail to understand that people are struggling to survive on Newstart, and this government is the one that dumped the next lot of single parents onto Newstart. And, listening to the coalition just then, you would think they were the nice, gentle, loving, kind people who liked single parents! They started this—you started it in 2005 when you started talking about Welfare to Work, and 2006 was when those changes came in that dumped single parents onto Newstart. Those single parents are the very ones who are already having to go to emergency relief organisations because they are trying to survive on Newstart. Of course, it is not only the single parents; people talk about single parents, but you have to remember it is their families, hundreds of thousands of people, living in poverty. So do not come in here and pretend that you despise the government for moving the next lot of single parents onto Newstart; they are just continuing the job you started. Both the old parties voted to dump the next lot of single parents onto Newstart in January. They combined against the Greens to dump them onto it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All these measures in the bills had their genesis in recommendations that have been generated by and result from inquiries that have been undertaken—for example, by the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee. But these measures are too little in their response to those recommendations, and they are too little in their response to the challenges that are facing Australians who are struggling to survive on income support payments such as Newstart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation has been subject to a short inquiry and a short period of public consultation. In that time, over 500 individuals wrote to me about this legislation and the need for stronger action, and I will be seeking leave to table these letters that they wrote which I have previously circulated to the whips.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to share just a few of the stories and accounts that are contained in those letters. Karen writes: 'I do not buy anything anymore. My son even had shoes that were a size too small and he refused to tell me as he knew I had no money to buy new shoes.' And Katrina wrote: 'On Parenting Payment I was able to get by as long as I was creatively frugal. Now all I can do is pay the rent and decide each week if we are going to eat or if I should make a part payment on my electricity bill. I do not have money for extras my son needs for school.' These are heart-wrenching accounts of the reality of life on Newstart. That is what this government joined with the coalition on and with the coalition's support has condemned hundreds and hundreds of single parents and their children to. These letters demonstrate to the Australian Greens that there is significant ongoing community support for the solutions proposed by us during the earlier inquiries and also support for the Australian Greens private senators' bills. These bills both increase Newstart and provide extra supplement supports for single parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the government's bill, contains three distinct measures that are intended to improve income management, but the Australian Greens note that each of these measures will only benefit some of those struggling to keep a roof over their heads and pay the bills on an income support payment that is more than $130 below the poverty line. Two of these measures, the pensioner education supplement and the retention of the pensioner card for those who are moved off parenting payment single but are now ineligible for Newstart, are restricted to single principal carers only. The other measure will benefit those who are already earning a small amount through casual work. Full-time students, older Australians, those with a partial disability, those living with episodic mental illness, those who lack work experience and those who have multiple barriers to employment will all be left behind by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extension of eligibility for the pensioner education supplement and the pensioner concession card will offset some of the impacts of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) legislation, which was examined by the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee in August 2012, but we must note that they actually returned the education supplement to those who lost it under that regime. In other words, under that previous bill, the government took it away and now is kindly restoring it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, because of this inappropriate measure being put in place in the first place, and a failure by the government to understand what impact this legislation would have on single parents, this measure comes too late for many, many single parents: those who have had to drop their study because they were not able to access this and those who have had to drop their study because they were put onto Newstart and no longer could afford to make ends meet. It does not help those people and it does not come in until March next year. So much for the government caring for those parents that they know us struggling to make ends meet on Newstart. So much for their care for those parents they are encouraging to get more work and improve their skills and qualifications. What do the government care? They callously took away access to that supplement from those parents who are trying to improve their qualifications and get an education so they can better support their family and find work into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Australian Greens consider that introducing these measures is still better, of course, than nothing, and better late than never, there is no doubt that the implementation of the Fair Incentives to Work legislation was devastating and is devastating to those who are affected. The impact of the $60-a-week drop in the base rate of income in the shift from parenting payment single to Newstart was compounded by the loss of the pensioner education supplement and also the pensioner concession cards for those who are dumped off income support altogether. The government claims this was to increase the number of people in work, but single parents have the highest rate of engagement with employment. In fact, we all know this was about the government saving a few dollars off the backs of single parents and their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has not been monitoring this impact, so it does not know what impact this appalling policy has had. We know, the Greens know, from the letters, the emails, the phone calls and text messages about this policy that we receive. We know the terrible human toll this has taken. Unfortunately, the Australian Greens are aware of a number of individuals who were studying and have had to leave those studies because they cannot afford the course fees or because they need to take on extra work to support their families. This measure restores a measure, as I said, that was previously in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rationale for improving the income-free area seems to rely on the assumption that most individuals have access to short-term work but refuse to take it up without better financial incentives. Does this government think that a whole $19 a week, or one extra hour of work a week, will do that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have rocks in their heads if they think that is the only thing stopping single parents and those on Newstart from being able to access work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Newstart inquiry into the adequacy of the payment demonstrated that those who are worst off under the current income management system are those who face multiple barriers to work and who need assistance to become work-ready. Budget estimates demonstrated that only 43 per cent of all clients were adequately helped into ongoing work for the year ending 12 September. This result dropped to an alarming 25 per cent for stream 4 jobseekers—the most disadvantaged clients. In other words, these job service support programs are not helping the most disadvantage and the people who face the most barriers to work. Why are we not fixing that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision of effective services to help jobseekers across the workforce is critical because the ability to work an extra hour a week will benefit only those who are able to access paid work. Yet the higher income-free area has not been accompanied by concrete improvements to jobseeker services. We are having to rely on the review, and on changes maybe coming in in 2015. This bill will provide no direct assistance to the majority of income recipients who have not been able to find work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Security Amendment (Supporting More Australians into Work) Bill 2013 has been presented as a response to the recommendations of the adequacy inquiry, but this decision to adjust the income-free area implements only one of the recommendations of that report. The Australian Greens believe there is clear evidence, as set out in our additional comments to this inquiry, that focusing on other aspects of the problem without addressing the basic inadequacy of the payments will simply fail jobseekers. In other words, this measure will not address the root problem, which is the inadequacy of the payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the government has chosen to tackle only one of the aspects of that report. It has ignored yet again the need to increase the base rate of these payments. Former OECD economist Peter Whiteford demonstrated to the adequacy inquiry that after paying rent a single person living on Newstart is likely to be left with less than $17 a day from which to cover all other expenses such as their utility, transport, personal care, clothes and, of course, food. We know from a number of recent inquiries that food is what people go without. People frequently go without meals because they cannot afford it, and parents go without meals so that they can feed their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With soaring rents in many capital cities and very low availability rates of affordable housing, the reality is that most people survive on even less than $17 per day, and simply cannot make ends meet. It is clear that many face hard choices, as is demonstrated in these letters. They face these hard choices every single day and make significant personal sacrifices of skipping meals, of going without. One long-term jobseeker and work for the dole participant summed this up in his letter: 'You get a break for lunch. I don't know why, because nobody eats. Nobody can afford to.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens have already tabled in this place two private senator's bills, which I referred to earlier, which would better deliver immediate and lasting relief for all those who are affected by these policies. These bills provide a comprehensive and immediate solution to the pressure that those surviving on Newstart, including single parents, are experiencing. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Caring for People on Newstart) Bill 2013 increases the basic rate of Newstart by $50 a week and introduces appropriate indexation that is linked to wages as well as to CPI.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Caring for Single Parents) Bill 2013 would further improve the situation for single parents by returning their income and the income test to a rate that is comparable to the parenting payment single, thereby undoing the income impacts of the fair incentives to work legislation—in other words, the legislation that dumped them onto Newstart. The important point there is that it would return the income-free area to what it was on parenting payment single, not the measly $17 a week that is contained in this bill. That is because it does not address the fundamental problems that are facing those trying to survive on Newstart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government may try to hoodwink the community that this will address the situation; it simply does not. They have report after report and they have no excuse to think that this is going to address the situation. As I said, report after report—reports from emergency relief organisations—all clearly demonstrate that the base rate of Newstart is inadequate, that those single parents who have been dumped across the board from January this year and those who have been dumped since 2006 onto Newstart are living in poverty. That is a whole next generation of children living in poverty. They are going without enough to eat and without the basic requirements. They are being forced out of their accommodation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Salvation Army report that was released not long ago as part of their Red Shield appeal clearly demonstrated the increase in the number of people accessing emergency relief. That clearly indicates that people are not able to find accommodation; they are homeless, they are couch surfing. That is what we are condemning these single parents to—those single parents who are trying to bring up our next generation. All the research shows that those children who are growing up in poverty and disadvantage are going to suffer, and that potentially has implications for their whole lives. That is what this policy fosters and that is what this bill fails to address. It does not address the basic issue, which is the inadequacy of the payments. We know that children are going to school hungry. We know that parents are going hungry. Why are we condemning those parents and those children to poverty?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that by increasing their base rate of income that we will help overcome one of the many barriers to work. And also, as I articulated earlier, we know that single parents are the cohort of people on income support who in fact have the highest work participation rates. This puts the complete lie to the fact that the government says that this is about encouraging people into work. It is not. It is about the government trying to save a penny or two on the backs of single parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though the measures contained in this bill do not form an adequate response to the challenges that Newstart participants face, the Australian Greens will support the package of these measures because, as I said, something is better than nothing. However, the Australian Greens remain committed to continuing to work towards the most comprehensive solutions that will lift people out of poverty and into secure, appropriate work. This does not do it. I have been campaigning on this since the day the Howard government announced that it would bring in welfare to work. And I will not cease campaigning on this until we have an increase in Newstart, until we have reversed those appalling, despicable cuts to single parents and until we can assure those single parents and their children that they will not be condemned to living in poverty in one of the wealthiest nations in on this planet. We will campaign on this to ensure that we achieve better outcomes for our most vulnerable Australians. It is simply inexcusable that in this country we are forcing the most vulnerable and the most disadvantaged people into living in unending poverty.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the Greens will be supporting these measures because every little bit will help. But it is not nearly enough, and our support does not indicate that we are complacent about the fact that we need to keep striving to ensure that our fellow Australians are able to live in dignity, able to have a satisfactory quality of life and not to condemn generations of children to live in poverty.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I certainly acknowledge the passion and the long-term interest of the previous speaker, Senator Siewert, and I join Senator Fifield in the comment that the coalition will not be opposing this legislation. Isn't it a shame that it has had to come into the chamber at all? What it does is try to undo some of the damage that Labor wreaked in what was a very, very callous attack on single parents in the latter part of last year. In so doing, Labor attacked vehemently the household budgets, as they are, of single parents. Senator Siewert has correctly and eloquently identified what those hardships have been as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here, today, engaged in this activity, because of the overwhelming outcry that occurred throughout many, many sectors of the community, such as the not-for-profit sector, the charity sector and the business sector, along with those others who were directly affected by this action. The matter was not helped when Minister Macklin made her intemperate comments about people being able to live on Newstart from the day that these changes would come into effect. I know that Senator Siewert and others made the attempt to live on Newstart and reported their inability to do so. I have participated in several inquiries by the Standing Committees on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations on this particular subject and it has, of course, been a harrowing experience to listen to the stories that are told. I have also had some association over time with bodies such as St Vincent de Paul and have visited and seen on the ground the damage that is wreaked upon these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have a circumstance whereby some 80,000 of Australia's most vulnerable families, generally single parent families, have been rushed into the position where they are to be moved off the parenting payment onto Newstart. Last year, when this measure was being proposed for a start date of 1 January 2013, I recall the impassioned pleas to the government to at least have some heart and delay or defer the commencement until March. Why?—for a number of reasons. Firstly, all families have increased costs leading up to Christmas. Secondly, straight after Christmas casual employment usually ceases or drops off and it is much more difficult for single parents, particularly single mothers, to find employment. Thirdly, the costs associated with the return to school is difficult. As usual, of course, this government was not in the least bit interested in that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Fifield correctly put his finger on it and noted that now the piggy bank is empty. This government has spent all of the funds that were available to it after the prudence of the previous Howard-Costello government. The $40 billion that was in the bank went very, very quickly. Perhaps one of the most disappointing and telling factors of this proposed legislation, which we are not opposing and which Senator Siewert has concurred the Greens will not be opposing, is the financial impact. The financial impact over the five years, the so-called out years, of taking people off the parenting payment and moving them to Newstart, and the difficulties associated with this, leads to an expense of $300 million. That $300 million sounds like an enormous amount of money, but do you know how much $300 million accounts for in actual interest on the debt we have in this country? It is 10 days. The $300 million over five years accounts for a mere 10 days interest on the billions of dollars of debt that this Labor government has run up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People can put it into their household accounts and relate the $300 billion perhaps to $300,000 of debt, or they can see what the impact would be on their business. But it is when you end up spending the surplus you have, when you end up wasting vast amounts of what, at the end of the day, are taxpayer dollars, that the chickens come home to roost, and the chickens are now well and truly back in the roost. The money saved from this situation––the situation correctly outlined by the previous speakers––and the impact it is having on those single parents equates to a mere 10 days interest—not the repayment of the principal, just the interest on the debt. As Senator Sinodinos said to me as he left the chamber when I drew his attention to the fact: 'Don't forget, Senator Back, that globally interest rates are now going up, so the 10 days of interest will probably be about eight days of interest.' Therein lies the tragedy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our committee hearings—and Senator Siewert was a member—we saw what has now become the first measure in this bill. The measure originally was that a recipient of the Newstart allowance, widow allowance, partner allowance, parenting payment and sickness allowance could earn $62 a fortnight before that had any impact on payments to which they were eligible. We all know that the minimum wage for an adult is now $16 an hour and in most circumstances you have to employ someone for at least three hours. Three 16s are 48, double that is 96—so anybody who was only getting $62 per fortnight was either working for less than they were entitled to or they were doing fewer hours. This is acknowledged, and it was the work of the committee that pushed towards elevating that $62 to $100 per fortnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure relates to eligibility for the pensioner education supplement for a single principal carer parent receiving Newstart. That is no doubt a benefit, but I hasten to the obvious fact that it does not help any single parent who is not studying. The third measure provides a 12-week extension of eligibility for the pensioner concession card to single parents who no longer qualify for the single parenting payment. I cannot help but reflect—and Madam Deputy President Stephens, I know you have a keen interest in the welfare of the wider community, as we all do—that we have to do this measure, and 10 days interest on the debt would have obviated or removed the need for that action to take place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the hearings that we had into these matters last year—the move from the single parenting payment back to Newstart, the adequacy of Newstart—to which we all contributed, there were several interesting points that came up. One of them was that one-third of this nation's expenditure budget, 33 per cent of the overall budget, is expended on social security and welfare. Senator Siewert is quite right: we are a wealthy country and we have a very small population on a very large landmass. Although it is not relevant to this discussion, I would always plead that we got there because of cheap energy, and one of the direct and indirect effects of the six years of this government has been to remove cheap energy and at the same time attack individual wealth. Nevertheless, I go back to that statistic: 33 per cent of our expenditure budget is on social security and welfare and, for your interest, 16 per cent is on health, eight per cent is on education. I asked several witnesses as they said they needed more: do you want to see a reduction in commitment to health? Of course, everyone does not. Do you want to see a reduction in commitment to education? No-one does. The obvious answer is to have a look at that 33 per cent, to have a look at the expenditure within social security and welfare, accounting for one dollar in three of this nation's expenditure, and start to target it at the higher priority areas. I would defy anyone to be able to mount an argument to any of us in this chamber that the people about whom we are speaking would not be right up at the top of that priority order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should the people of Australia honour the coalition with government later this year, whenever that is, I would ask all sides of politics to have a good, long, hard look at where those priority orders are. I want to give you an example if I may. Only three weeks ago the member for Murray and I visited a meatworks in the Goulburn Valley of Victoria, the highest youth unemployment area in Victoria, according to Dr Stone. That particular abattoir was seeking to employ 50 unskilled workers. They wanted no skills, because they would train them on the job for long-term, secure employment. But nevertheless, as senators would understand, the nature of employment in abattoirs requires a high degree of occupational health and safety. So it was critical, according to the manager of the meatworks, that each person being considered for employment would have to satisfy a no-drugs policy. Of the first 30 single, unemployed young people who came forward, 26 said 'We can't meet your drugs policy,' so they went back to being on Newstart. I find that to be unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think the Australian taxpayer, a generous taxpayer, would willingly see a third of the nation's expenditure budget going on a person or people who, for their own decision making, for their own recreational satisfaction, choose not to work in a job in which they would be trained and there would be secure employment in a region of one of our states, and not have to work because they do not want to be involved in a process in which they are drug free. As I sat in the general manager's office, I could not help but think of the sort of people who came before us in our inquiries on the matter to do with the movement of people from the paid parental program down to Newstart. I thought to myself: what has gone wrong in this country when fit, able, single young people do not have to work? You would say, 'Well, if a country is so wealthy that you can accommodate these things, everybody is okay.' Well, they are not okay. As Senator Fifield and Senator Siewert have said—and as Senator Siewert has tabled—it is not okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is okay is that those who need it most—those single parents who are struggling and making decisions between putting shoes on their children's feet or feeding their children or themselves or paying their electricity and other utility bills—should be at the top of the priority order. We saw the circumstance during 'Rudd 1' as opposed to 'Rudd 2' when he as Prime Minister ran around the countryside in December 2009 throwing out $900 cheques for the specific purpose of avoiding Australia being in a recession. You will recall he ran around in March 2010 doing the same thing with $1,200 cheques at a time when we should have been putting in place expenditures and allocations that would have ensured we would have maintained into the future the living standards and lifestyles to which we are accustomed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on other committees we sat on and, when we asked people what they did with the $900 cheques, they fell broadly into four categories. Some people saved the money, so therefore it did not help with the economic stimulus. When I sat on the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform—Mr Wilkie's committee—and went to Tasmania, I sat there and listened to witnesses. This was in the gambling reform hearings associated with poker machines. This fellow said to me, 'If you want to know where all our money went, Senator, you just have to go to the casinos, the pubs and the clubs, because whatever $900 cheques we got go straight into the pokies.' That was the second of the two. The third was Chinese television sets, as Harvey Norman and others all told us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth is this: Senator Birmingham—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—if you want to go back and review the Friday night those payments were made and the Friday night when the $1,200 cheques were paid in March 2010, you will see an incredible spike in attendances at the accident and emergency centres of the major hospitals around Australia—an unexpected spike the first time around. They were totally and utterly caught unawares, as I was told by a nursing sister who attended the Royal Perth Hospital. They had to bring staff in urgently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the four categories of spending those payments went to—the $900 cheques. When you have a look now at the fact that we have gone from a $40 billion surplus to a $300 billion debt and at the fact that we are paying $1,000 million a month interest on that debt at the moment, it causes one to weep when you see that the saving over five years from this measure—and Senator Siewert has quite correctly identified the harshness of this measure—equates to 10 days of interest on the debt as a result of the waste of this government, which commenced under now Prime Minister Rudd.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need to see a realignment. I return to the electorate of Murray, to again tell a story. I am by no means demeaning those who have come into this country, but I simply use this as an illustration of where we have got it wrong. There was a very proud African community in that particular electorate. They were all large families getting jobs and keeping jobs—everything was fine. The member for Murray became aware that a lot of these people, in fact, were stopping working. So she inquired as to why they might have stopped working. It was because another group had come into that community and were making no attempt to actually get employment and, with large families, they were enjoying significant income from the government. We have to have a scenario in place in this country again where we encourage employment, particularly when you look at agriculture throughout Australia, where we now have to rely on backpackers not just to attend to fruit picking but to work on farms—harvesting crops et cetera. You say to yourself, 'How is it in this country that people who are able to work, where there are jobs available for them, do not take those jobs?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my remarks, if I may, on the circumstance now confronting us with refugees, who themselves are not allowed to work. The policy of this coalition is, firstly, to have a circumstance in which those people remain safely in their own countries but, secondly, if they are here, to process them quickly and, thirdly, to allow them to do some work. This is the community of people who, as yet, have not been processed and are not allowed to work. It was on 14 August last year that the government brought in its so-called no-advantage test over those people who are in refugee camps—rotting, as many of them have been, sometimes for up to two generations. The solution was to bring in the no-advantage test. Senator Cash, the shadow parliamentary secretary in this area, tells me that there are now some 19,000 people who have not yet had the opportunity to lodge a claim to be processed. So therefore they cannot work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the concluding comments, if I may, I agree with and support Senator Fifield. We will not oppose this legislation. Should we be honoured with government, I appeal to all sides of the chamber to work towards a scenario in which that social security and welfare budget is allocated where the priority is highest. I have no doubt it is the community of people about whom we are speaking at the moment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  As we come to the fag end of the 43rd Parliament, it is a good time to assess the government's failures. Many of my colleagues have mentioned some of the failures. None of us are sure whether it is Mr Rudd or Ms Gillard—the Rudd or Gillard government—but it does not make a lot of difference: same policies, same failures; same horse, different jockey.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few weeks my colleagues have spoken a lot about the mining tax—a tax that very strangely raises no money. Imagine the Labor Party doing that. They actually have a tax that raises no money, the mining tax—one of the gross policy failures. Another great policy failure is the world's largest carbon tax, which will have no impact on the climate. What an appalling policy failure—another one. </span>

                    </a>  I apologise. When Mr Rudd was Prime Minister he thought it would be a good idea to soften John Howard's successful boats policy. Why did he do it? Because he thought we were heartless, that we had no ethics. It is this pathetic moral vanity that has undermined Australia's borders. It was the greatest policy failure of the Rudd and Gillard governments, an appalling policy failure, to expose our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to speak about something you cannot always see, that Labor and the Greens want to forget, that is sometimes a little bit harder to touch. My colleagues today have spoken a lot about the fiscal failure of the Labor government. They have spoken about the enormous debt—$178 billion—and the enormous fiscal failure. They have mentioned that the interest on the debt alone would pay for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We have heard about the great cash-splash, in which people bought flat screen colour televisions. We have heard so much about the overpriced school halls over the years and also the pink batts fiasco. We have done that to death. My colleagues have done a superb job of holding the government to account on the fiscal failure of public debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to speak about the moral failure of the government and public debt. We on this side have always known that social democracy is a bit of a con. Essentially, social democracy is a pyramid scheme not only sanctioned by the state but eulogised by it. Social democracy is premised on the assumption that the number of taxpayers and national productivity will continue to grow at a sufficient rate to support growing social welfare. Social democracy is premised on the notion that the number of taxpayers and national productivity will continue to grow at a sufficient rate to support the growing impost on the Treasury of growing social welfare. The government's underlying economic assumptions are based on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But social democracy will break down if the number of taxpayers or the productive output of a nation are insufficient to meet the obligations made by government or where the obligations keep increasing because of, for example, increased life expectancy, something states cannot always predict. What has been happening in the West, in the developed world, for at least the past 20 years is that both of these scenarios are happening: there are not enough taxpayers left in the developed world and we are not sufficiently productive to meet our ever-expanding welfare demands. The economy is not sufficiently productive and there are not sufficient taxpayers to meet the increasing imposts on the government of social welfare and recurrent expenditure. And this lot, the government, has to believe that, because that is what they premise their entire political beliefs on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has the developed world been doing to meet these growing welfare demands? They can meet them by borrowing money to pay for them. They can borrow money to pay a welfare bill. You borrow it on the credit card to pay for a welfare bill and to pay for current expenditure. If you do that, you go into debt and you also shift the obligation from the generation that receives the benefits to those who will not. Let me explain what I mean. You are asking, in effect, future generations—your children and your grandchildren—to pay the public debt that our generation is now racking up. Let me just quote from Professor Niall Ferguson, whose <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Degeneration: How</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Institutions Decay and Economies Die</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>is based on the BBC Radio 4 Reith lectures for 2012. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The heart of the matter is the way public debt allows the current generation of voters—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that is us—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">to live at the expense of those as yet too young to vote or as yet unborn. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We spend their money, we spend their inheritance. He goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These mind-boggling numbers represent nothing less than a vast claim by the generation currently retired or about to retire on their children and their grandchildren, who are obliged by current law to find the money in the future …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have to find the money in the future by submitting either to substantial increases in taxation or to drastic cuts in other forms of public expenditure—that is, in welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we rack up on the credit card, your children and your grandchildren will have to repay. We are living at their expense throughout the developed world. This is not just a fiscal failure, it is a moral failure. Ferguson goes on to cite the great conservative Edmund Burke. Acting Deputy President Bernardi, I know you are a great devotee of Edmund Burke. Ferguson says: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In enormous intergenerational transfers implied by current fiscal policies, we see a shocking and perhaps unparalleled breach of … partnership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He says that society is more than just us, the voters. Society includes those who cannot yet vote and those yet unborn. Edmund Burke recognised that all those years ago in the 18th century. Burke recognised that we govern not just for ourselves and not just for our current generation but also for our kids, our grandchildren and those yet unborn. This is not just a fiscal test. It is a moral test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very easy for us to rack up debt. This lot has done it better than anyone else in the history of this country. The Labor and Green alliance has had the five largest budget deficits in Australian history. It is not just a fiscal failure; it is a moral failure. We have to understand that any government governs not just for today but for the future and the future of our children and our grandchildren and those yet unborn. That connection between the generations is the heartbeat of our country. We are responsible not just for the next rent seeker wanting more welfare and not just for another industry asking for protection. Every time we decide to spend more money, we have to decide whether that debt is worth putting on the loan book of our kids and our grandkids. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wish western Europe and the United States had thought about that. I know even in my area of universities and research I would love to be able to spend more money. In a way universities and research create much of the productivity and innovation for our country </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But every time a government makes a decision about expending more money it must ask this question: does this assist our kids and our grandkids? We cannot allow ourselves to wallow in the financial profligacy that has totally undermined the capacity of Western Europe and the United States. I hear the argument from the other side of the chamber, from the Labor Party and the Greens, that 'it doesn't matter, you've got to spend a bit to get a bit'. That is exactly the argument that has been used throughout Western Europe and the United States since World War 2. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second that taxpayers cannot raise sufficient tax and productivity starts to fall, guess what happens? Debt starts to rise. Despite the fact that this government has raised debts that have never been seen before in this country, there is no argument that it was all done for our kids or our grandkids—no argument at all. Does anyone actually believe that this government would ever return our budget to surplus? Does anyone believe that? Even more so, does anyone actually believe that the Australian Labor Party and their Greens allies would ever start paying back public debt? They do not even believe it themselves. They would never pay back public debt because they think it is not a bad idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference between Australia and the rest of the developed world is not the Labor Party, it is the coalition. If the coalition had not won two out of every three federal elections since the end of the Second World War, I can say with absolute certainty: this country would be in systemic debt, just like every other social democratic country on earth. We would have a debt level not of eight or nine per cent but of 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 per cent of GDP, without any doubt. The fact that our country overall has a low public debt is no thanks to them. It is because of the fact that the coalition has won two out of every three elections since World War 2. We are the only reason that Australia is not like the rest of the world with very high public debt. If you do not believe me, just look at the history, ladies and gentlemen. Since 1901, when our nation came into being, every time Labor has left office it has left us further in debt. There is not one exception since the first Labor government, of John Christian Watson, in 1904. I hear the other side going: 'Well, you know, sometimes you've got to fight a world war, Brett, so you go into debt.' Sure, if you have to fight a world war you go into debt. But what never changes, whether Labor governs in good times or bad times, during peace or war, is that always there is more and more public debt. As I said, there has never been an exception in 110 years since the first Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is their greatest disgrace. Sure, they failed miserably with asylum seeker policy. We all accept that. The moral vanity of Mr Rudd is absolutely appalling. And, sure, their carbon tax is absolutely pathetic. I can see some friends of mine here this afternoon who fought against the carbon tax. The only way we will ever cut emissions worldwide is through multilateral action if the G20 decides to do something. To act unilaterally like the Labor Party did is ridiculous. There is no way Australia acting by itself and having the world's largest carbon tax will have any impact on climate at all. Zip, as Mr Rudd would say. The asylum seeker policy, the carbon tax and, of course, the mining tax that raised no money are all appalling, shocking failures. But the greatest failure, the moral failure, is the public debt. That side, the Labor Party and the Greens, always talk about social justice, and everyone on this side is sick to death of hearing about how they believe in fairness, equity and justice and that the coalition does not give a damn about fairness, equity and justice. That is what they always argue. The greatest moral failure of the Labor Party and the Greens, I swear to you, Acting Deputy President Bernardi, will be the debt that this lot impose on your children and your grandchildren—and they will do it, because they have done it since Federation and they have never, ever changed their spots.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a new Treasurer, Mr Bowen, and Mr Rudd is again casting himself as an economic conservative. Remember, he was a social democrat; when he ran for office in 2007, you will recall, he became an economic conservative; and then he abandoned economic conservatism because of the global financial crisis and became a born-again Keynesian, a born-again social democrat. Then he realised one very important thing. He realised that his entire political belief system was wrong. He argued his economic belief that only social democracy—only Mr Rudd, really—could save capitalism, could save liberal democracy. And what have we learnt in the last six years of a Labor government about the world economy? We have learnt that the only people that can save social democracy, the only people that can pay for their spending, are liberal democrats—those who believe in entrepreneurial activity, entrepreneurship, business and capitalism. In the end, in the Western world, capitalism and entrepreneurial activity will have to save social democracy. That is the change. This lot, under Mr Rudd, argued that the only thing that would save the United States and Western Europe was social democracy. Now we know that is wrong. The only thing that will save social democracy is liberal democracy. He even got that wrong. Not only has Mr Rudd abandoned his economic theories yet again, for the third time—he has changed his economic clothing three times; worse than that is the shocking moral failure of Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I believed even for a second that this lot would start paying back public debt, would force my generation to live within its means, just like householders have to live within their means, I would give them some credit. But I know they have absolutely no intention of living within their means. They will throw around largesse to try to win votes, they will promise the world and they will put our kids and grandchildren in debt. That is the great economic, social and moral failure of the Left not only in Australia but also in the Western world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the next election, our party is seeking to govern not just for our generation, for you ladies and gentlemen in the public gallery; we are seeking to govern for your kids, your grandkids and all children yet unborn.</span>

                    </a>  Well, Senator Polley, you have a crack. But I tell you: your party is now like an AFL football team—through you, Acting Deputy President Bernardi—that has no back line. Its entire back line has been carted off on a stretcher, and the only problem for Senator Polley and the rest of Labor is that it is their captain that has been running around the back like a sniper and taking out the entire back line. They are now sitting on the stretcher in the dugout on the side. That is the situation the Labor Party find themselves in. It is the same crazy mob, with the same policies. The Prime Minister told us yesterday things were going to change, but he is the one that took out the back line of the Labor Party who are now sitting on the backbench because they cannot serve as part of the team. He is the one that took out these senior members of the Labor Party.</span>

And that is the sort of thing that they have done to agencies within the government. What they have done to agriculture and to fisheries and forestry in the last six years has been an absolute disgrace. Let us hope that the people of rural Australia show them the message when it comes to the election.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:01</span>):  The sugar industry has been a very significant contributor to the economy of Queensland and Australia almost since the first Europeans landed on this shore. The first stick of sugarcane came into Australia with the First Fleet, and since then the industry has grown to be a major contributor to the economy and, I might say, culture of Queensland and that part of northern New South Wales that supports a sugar industry. I proudly come from a sugar town, the town of Ayr, in the Burdekin region, and somewhat parochially I say that the Burdekin region is without doubt the best sugar-growing area in the world. We have sunshine and not a lot of rain but plenty of underground water. We have a significant growing industry, with farmers who are very skilled, innovative and forward looking and mills that are fairly well up to date and amongst some of the best organised around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sugar industry in Queensland and indeed Australia really owes a lot to Pacific islanders, who were first brought to Queensland to do the work that it was thought that white men could not do in the tropics. In the time when the blackbirders were rife—not quite slavery traders but almost—some 62,500 Pacific islanders are thought to have been brought to Queensland to engage in the sugar industry. Most of them were from Melanesia—Vanuatu, the Solomons—and some were Polynesians. Many of those families never returned to their homeland, or, having returned, some of them came back to Australia, and of course the descendants of Pacific islanders now form a very significant part of many of the communities along the coast of North Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is such a significant industry. It has had its ups and downs, but by and large it has been a very big contributor to the wealth of Queensland and Australia. It goes in cycles. In my time of living in Ayr and working around the sugar industry, there have been cycles of good times and bad times. Back in the early 2000s, the industry was in some difficulty. The Howard government provided some $400 million in assistance to help the industry through that difficult time because the Howard government recognised just what an important factor the industry was to many coastal towns and cities along the coast of North Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the early days of the Federation of Australia, the influx of Pacific islanders was stopped. You might recall that the Labor Party in those days were very keen on a White Australia policy—something that, of course, they like to airbrush out of history these days. But it was good for the sugar industry. Many of the islanders who played such a big part in the sugar industry remain. But what it meant was that European migrants came in to take over the hard, backbreaking work in the tropics that was previously done by the Pacific islanders. We had in those early days a lot of people from Italy, and later from Greece and Spain, and even later from central Europe. These people entering Australia—often as very poor, almost penniless immigrants—worked very hard in the hot tropical sun cutting cane by hand and made some money. Over the history of the sugar industry, those early European immigrants doing the hard work have saved their money and bought farms or invested wisely, and now most of the sugar industry growers and many of the milling people are descendants of those early Europeans. They have done particularly well along the coast of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only have they brought economic value to North Queensland, north Australia and Australia as a whole, but also it has been a big part in the multicultural development of Australia. If you go anywhere in the North, you will find very multicultural communities that still recognise and celebrate their connection with their homeland. Indeed, the Australian Italian Festival that is held in Ingham every May Day is a great event that really highlights the influence of Italian immigrants on the Australian way of life and particularly on the sugar industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that have kept the sugar industry going so well is that it has always been an industry which is keen on innovation, development and research into new ideas. These days, of course, competing with cheap-labour countries overseas, the industry could not continue to exist if it did not have that innovation, that research and the cutting edge in industry innovation and development. That is why the Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013 is so important and that is why I am delighted that the coalition will be supporting the government's initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this stage I express my thanks both to the former agriculture minister Senator Ludwig and to the Greens political party, particularly Senator Siewert, for facilitating this bill on the program today. Unfortunately, when the first list of the bills that were going to be guillotined through this place before parliament rose came out, this bill was not on the list. When I approached Senator Ludwig he said: 'Yes, it should be, but I don't know what's been happening with those who make these decisions. It's disappeared from the list.' Because I know the industry is so keen to have this bill passed and because I know it is essential for the continuing development of the industry, it was necessary to encourage the Labor Party and the Greens to ensure that this bill was dealt with today, and I express—not only personally but on behalf of the sugar industry as a whole—my thanks, particularly to Senator Ludwig and Senator Siewert, for facilitating the passage of this bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the thirties and fifties, there was a lot of innovation. Indeed, because Australia could not compete with cheap labour overseas, a lot of work went into mechanical harvesting and mechanical transporting of the cut sugar cane. A lot of innovation has gone into mills and the way sugar is extracted. In more recent times, a lot of innovation and research has gone into the energy uses of sugar cane and its by-products. That is why the industry was so keen to have this new arrangement put in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who understand that R&amp;D companies are supported by the Commonwealth government would be surprised at the universal support for the new research and development program that is set up in this bill. Indeed, millers and growers in the sugar industry in Queensland—not always the best of friends, I might say—have got together and formed the Australian Sugar Industry Alliance Limited to make sure that the industry moves forward as a whole. The alliance was very keen to see that this new research facility—involving both the growing and the milling—did enable the Australian industry to keep ahead of the pack in research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These new R&amp;D corporations always come at a cost and in this instance the cost per tonne of cane that will support the new research body is 70c per tonne of sugar cane, paid equally by the growers and millers. This 70c a tonne, though, replaces other levies that used to be imposed on the industry for research and development: 14c a tonne for the Sugar Research and Development Corporation; 55c a tonne for the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations, a Queensland based research organisation which, I might add, has done a magnificent job over the years that it was in operation; and a further 5c a tonne for SRL activity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the industry is paying less in total than it was before and that is why 77 per cent of canegrowing businesses—some 3,440—returned their voting papers on the ballot to determine whether this new industry body would operate and whether the new levies would apply. Of those 77 per cent of growers who returned their voting papers, a massive number of 84.3 per cent approved the proposal and supported the new arrangement. Only 15.7 per cent voted no. Those people who understand how these ballots usually occur in rural industries would understand that that is a massively significant positive result. All seven milling companies voted yes, so this new arrangement of research and development has universal support within the sugar growing industry, both in Queensland and in New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some 4,400 individual growing entities within the sugar industry, which has a total employment of some 16,000 people. They form the mainstay of many communities, like my own in Northern Queensland, and in the north of New South Wales. Some 360,000 hectares are harvested annually and the cane crushed in 2012 was some 30,000 megatonnes. The amount of sugar produced was 4,250 of a unit of quantity that I am not familiar with. A significant amount of that sugar is exported overseas. The industry's revenue in 2012 was $2,000 million and the value of sugar for export was $1,500 million. Clearly, this is a very significant industry for Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pause here to recognise the significant role that the former President of Canegrowers Queensland Mr Alf Cristaudo contributed to the industry. Alf has been leading the industry over very difficult times for a very long period and he has been a magnificent leader. He has retired as chairman of the Canegrowers organisation, although I know he will still be around, making a contribution to his community and the cane industry in the years ahead. I welcome the election of Mr Paul Schembri, from Mackay, who is the new Canegrowers supremo, if I can call him that. I know Paul will continue to lead the industry in the very adult and sensible way that it has been led to the benefit of the canegrowers, the millers and, indeed, the wider community over many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I briefly mentioned before, this industry is not just about producing its main product of raw sugar; it has also, in more recent times, gone into the green energy area. There is a huge potential for greater use of sugar cane for energy. Some sugar cane is used for ethanol, and that is an area where there is a big future. But all of this requires proper research—clever, well-funded research—and dedicated and focused development and research issues. That is why this bill today and this new organisation that is being set up to do the research and development for the whole industry are so absolutely important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The process has been going for some years now. If I were critical of Senator Ludwig, I would say in passing that it has taken a long time to get to this particular point, but we are at least here, so I think that is tremendous. It is important this bill go through. I see my colleague Senator Joyce is in the chamber, and I know Senator Joyce's significant support for the industry over many years. I might curtail my remarks there so that Senator Joyce can have a couple of words on this significant industry research and development and extension program that is being supported by this bill. As I mentioned, the coalition will be supporting this, and good luck to the industry in the future. I know they will go on from strength to strength.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:17</span>):  I thank Senator Macdonald and concur with his remarks. If we are truly going to live in the Asian century, if we hope to be a powerhouse in agriculture, then we have to facilitate all the facets that bring that about. We note that the interest in the Australian sugar industry is intense. This industry can be a champion of the future, especially of North Queensland, and a champion of areas of new development, especially in areas such as the Ord. But if we are going to take the industry forward then we have to take it forward in a clever way. The world is not foolish in agricultural production; it is quite wise. When we hear that India can be a net food exporter, your general belief that, because there are a great number of people, therefore they are all hungry is not necessarily correct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what does happen is, as the world's middle class grows, they look for a higher quality of food, and a higher capacity for the attainment of a quality product. Therefore, we have every interest, for our own self-interest, in making sure that we are at the forefront of research and development in our key agricultural export commodities. So, in places such as sugar, beef and wheat, we need to have a real footprint, and we need to have the intellectual property that takes our nation to a position where, as the commodity booms in other areas—such as mining—start to taper off somewhat, that space can be filled by the increase in production in agricultural sectors and service sectors. So, as a smart economy and as a smart opposition that hopes that, if it places itself right, it might get the honour of leading the nation, we want to make sure that we do everything in our power to conduct the research in sugar as a key example of a key Australian crop. I thank the Senate for the capacity to give me some consideration on this matter, and I commend the Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013.</span>

                    </a>  For the purposes of the debate, I would like to indicate that the motion seeks for standing order 18, establishing the Committee of Privileges, to be amended so that the committee would consist of eight senators—four nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, three nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and one nominated by a minority party and Independent senators. There is a very good reason for moving this amendment today, and that is to represent the democratic wishes of the Australian people and in particular in terms of the representation here in the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current membership of the Privileges Committee is under a temporary order of the Senate that was passed in October 2011 without any opposition from any party or Independent in the chamber, and it has been working well ever since. It is an accepted practice with Senate committees that they should be reflective of the composition of the chamber. Every other substantive Senate committee has got crossbench representation. For example, if you consider the legislation committees or the references committees, the Procedure Committee or the Standing Committee of Senators' Interests, all have crossbench representation—minor party and/or Independent representation. The Privileges Committee is the odd one out. As I indicated, that was changed by temporary order in 2011 and it has worked extremely well. There can be no argument in democratic representation. The Senate committee system is indeed one of its great strengths. I think all of us in here who have served—and everybody does from time to time—on the various committees will recognise that the strength of the Senate is having all the views in this Senate represented and given voice on those committees. The committee system has worked well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some of us who were here in the Senate when the Howard government had control of both houses of the federal parliament. We saw then a change to the committee system for the worst. I remember that, when I was first elected here and took my seat in 2005, Senator Siewert and I moved for references on a number of occasions. One in particular was the impact of climate change on Australia's agricultural industries. It took us years before the Senate would finally agree to that, because it was blocked as a result of the majority that the Howard government had in both houses of parliament and they did not want to have the views of the alternative voices in the parliament considered, and yet now everybody across Australia's rural and regional communities understands the impacts of climate change that they are already suffering, and we could have been dealing with that years earlier if we had not been blocked from doing so. No-one will forget that the change to the committee system that occurred then gave the government control of all Senate committees. That has fortunately changed back, and I would hate to think that there were any prospects in the future, after such a bad experiment, that Senate committees would not reflect the make-up of the Senate. It is on that basis that I argue strongly that the Privileges Committee does need to represent—</span>

                    </a>  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Before we vote on this, I think it is very important that, when Senator Milne talks about minor parties, she points out whether she is referring to the Greens—or does that include the National Party?</span>

                    </a>  It certainly is true that the National Party is a minor party. If that is how they wish to describe themselves, well and good—and the Australian Greens outpoll them all over the country—but I do not think that is relevant to the point I make in terms of representation on Senate committees. In fact, the opposition parties are represented on all Senate committees, as they should be, but the minor parties and Independents are not represented on the Privileges Committee. That is why I am arguing that the Privileges Committee ought to come into line with all the other Senate committees and have representation from the crossbenches. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is particularly important that we have this matter settled, because it would not be appropriate that we go to an election with a temporary order in place with a view to it lapsing without making a decision about permanency. I would like to hear from anyone who says that democracy is not well served by having representation from the crossbenches on the Privileges Committee. It would be grossly unfair if it were deemed that the Privileges Committee were the plaything of the two old parties. </span>

Having said that, I think it is important that we settle this matter, that we change the membership of the Privileges Committee on a permanent basis so that we end up with a fair representation which shows that the crossbench has a percentage of members in this place and that that percentage of members needs to be represented in all of the Senate committees.</span>

I simply ask: are we really to believe that the deals that have been done today will stop the longstanding precedent and principle that all proposed changes to standing orders go to the Procedures Committee? That has been the practice each and every time there has been a change to standing orders in this place. This proposal has not been to the Procedures Committee, and I simply say to those opposite, especially the ALP: be exceptionally careful. I am just asking for your guidance, Mr President, as to whether this motion will allow that strong principle, that strong precedent that has been followed by everybody, to just be tossed out the window like a soiled tissue, discarded without any thought.</span>

In fact, some may say, in relation to those people who speak with forked tongue and stand up in this place and say one thing and then do another, that those actions are grubby little actions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in relation to this particular bill, which the Greens are joining with Labor today to support, this is probably one of the greatest travesties of justice that is ever to go through this place. By this bill, Labor and their little friends the Greens are throwing a few crumbs at the lowest-paid workers in Australia and they are acting as if those few crumbs are gold. When you read the details of this legislation, it becomes apparent that the Early Years Quality Fund Special Account Bill is nothing more and nothing less than a con.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Voice union was having trouble signing up members, so what did it do? It went to its union mates in the government and said, 'We need some money', and a deal was done to give United Voice what is in effect $300 million, which they will have access to through this fund. And then what did United Voice do? They went on a membership drive, and do you know what they said? They blatantly misled the lowest-paid workers in Australia—those who work in the child-care industry—and they sent out the following propaganda. They sent out a document that stated: 'How does my centre qualify for the money that they can get under the fund? This is how you qualify: you join United Voice.' Well, no, actually—you do not need to join United Voice to get access to this fund. United Voice then negotiates a new EBA, because—guess what? One of the conditions of this fund is that the childcare centre has to have an EBA. And guess what? Only 20 per cent of childcare centres in Australia have an EBA—knocking out, overnight, 80 per cent of childcare centres in Australia. They automatically do not qualify for this fund unless United Voice negotiates an EBA on their behalf. They then say the owner-operator signs an agreement with the government. And guess what the end process is? You get a raise. That is blatantly misleading the lowest-paid workers in Australia. The Labor Party and their little friends in the Green movement know full well that less than 40 per cent of those in the childcare sector will get any share of these funds—less than 40 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So when they stand up in this place and they say that they are getting a raise for the lowest-paid workers in Australia and they have the audacity to then send out propaganda to those workers indicating that they will all get a raise, that is an absolute disgrace. It shows just how low those on the other side will go to blatantly mislead those vulnerable people in the childcare sector who actually believed that this legislation was going to give them a pay rise. That is completely, totally and utterly incorrect. There is only $300 million going into this fund. There are exceptionally strict guidelines under which a childcare centre in Australia can apply for the funds—which automatically, in relation to the EBA, knocks out over 80 per cent of childcare centres in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But worse than that even the former minister—the minister had to resign because he could not serve under the current Prime Minister, Mr Rudd—Minister Garrett claimed that 68,000 people may or may not be entitled to the pay rise. Media reports say that it is closer to a workforce of 78,000. But guess what? When at estimates we asked the department how many childcare workers in Australia would potentially qualify for these funds, do you know what the department said? They said, 'We actually don't know.' But they could confirm one thing: they could confirm that 40 per cent or fewer of the childcare sector will qualify for the funds. Do you know what is even worse?</span>

You are creating a two-tiered system within child care in Australia.' But why does that surprise me? Those on the other side play elitist politics every day of the week. Those on the other side love class warfare. This is exactly what this bill does. They throw $300 million at United Voice. United Voice can then run around on a membership drive and sign up a few extra people. And they will be telling them that they are going to get a pay rise, and that is blatantly misrepresenting what this legislation does. But at least the childcare sector knows that this legislation is nothing more and nothing less than confirmation of what we already knew about the former Gillard government—and quite frankly the current Rudd government. And we all know that Senator Wong voted for Rudd, the sisterhood stabbing one of their own in the back. You always have to like it, don't you, when the sisterhood stab one of their own in the back? Stabbing people in the back is exactly what this legislation does.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is worse than the fact that this is merely for a union membership drive and worse than the fact that 40 per cent or fewer of the sector will qualify is that the fund runs out after two years and then there is no money; no money at all. The Labor Party, the party of the workers, throw a bit of money at a few people in the sector and pretend that they are saving the world and giving them a huge pay rise—and they pretend that they are the party of the workers—when in reality this is nothing more and nothing less than one of the worst con jobs that has ever come before this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you have the childcare centres, who have said to the government in submission after submission: 'We are concerned. What happens if we apply for these funds and are not successful? What do we then go back and say to our workers? Our union, United Voice, told the workers they're getting a pay rise. But under the guidelines, they're not getting a pay rise. What do we say to the workers?' I can tell you what United Voice are going to be saying: they are going to be saying, 'That bad employer refused to pass that pay rise on.' But there will be no pay rise; there never was a pay rise. This legislation is just smoke and mirrors, nothing more and nothing less.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is worse is that a lot of the childcare centres have said that, as a result of this grubby little piece of legislation, they are going to have to raise the wages that they pay to compete with those who may get a wage rise courtesy of the government. But they cannot afford to. All this government is doing is creating a two-tiered system in Australia. But you would expect nothing more and nothing less from those elitists on the other side.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this Bill is to propose a package of integrity measures that seek to enhance the government's ability to deter sponsor behaviour which is inconsistent with the policy intent of the Subclass 457 visa program and other temporary employer sponsored visa programs.  Together with proposed amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994, this Bill presents a comprehensive package of reforms which would balance the interests of Australian workers with the need to strengthen protection for overseas workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the Bill gives powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman (and Fair Work Inspectors) to monitor and investigate compliance with sponsorship obligations, to ensure workers are working in their nominated occupation and being paid market salary rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will require Subclass 457 sponsors to undertake Labour Market Testing in relation to a nominated occupation, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations, to ensure that Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible temporary visa holders are given first opportunity to apply for skilled vacancies in the domestic labour market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government has always said that the Subclass 457 visa plays an important role in allowing employers to address skilled shortages when skilled local labour is unavailable.  It is intended as a vehicle to allow employers to quickly supplement the Australian labour market, including the use of Enterprise Migration Agreements and Regional Migration Agreements, where a genuine skill shortage exists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is an important component of our overall non-discriminatory migration program, which is roughly comprised of one third families and two thirds skilled migration. Just over half of the current holders of Subclass 457 visas go on to apply for permanent residence and we think that's appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Usage of the Subclass 457 visa program has been growing strongly in recent years.   The number of primary Subclass 457 visa holders in Australia has risen from 68 400 in June 2010 to 106 680 as at 31 May 2013, an increase of 56 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many growing industries including those connected with the resources boom, such as mining, as well as non-resource sector users of the program, such as health care and information and communications technology (ICT), accounted for a large portion of all Subclass 457 visa grants in 2011-12.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, strong growth has also been recorded in industries in which employment has fallen recently, such as accommodation and food service, and retail trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It concerns the government that, at a time when the labour market has been flattening and some sectors and regions have experienced lay-offs and increased unemployment, the Subclass 457 program has continued to grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Coupled with this strong growth is a tendency for some employers to source foreign labour through the Subclass 457 program without regard to the Australian domestic labour force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These trends highlight that current requirements do not commit sponsors to using the Subclass 457 program as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, the domestic labour force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the recently released report of the Migration Council Australia, survey data of Subclass 457 employer sponsors revealed that 15% of employers say that they have no difficulty finding suitable labour locally and yet they sponsor employees from overseas under this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, 7% of primary visa holders surveyed said that they were remunerated differently to their Australian counterparts doing the same work, while 2% stated they were paid well under the minimum salary for a 457 employee which is currently $51,400.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Indeed, the reforms at the heart of this Bill are not unique to the Australian context. As recently as the 7th of May this year, the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Stephen Harper – a conservative – stated in relation to his country's equivalent of the Subclass 457 scheme:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Not only has the government indicated for some time that it would be reforming the temporary foreign workers program, but in the budget last year specifically we brought in measures to better match job vacancies with people who are seeking work or in the employment insurance system. We have been very clear. We need to do a better job of matching the demand for employment insurance and the demand for temporary foreign workers. That is precisely what the government has been doing for a year and a half … The minister brought in changes last year to make sure people who are on employment insurance get first crack at jobs rather than temporary foreign workers."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Canadian Government is taking steps to tighten the provisions of their program to ensure that only genuine skill shortages are being filled by temporary overseas labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Likewise, academics from the Law School of The University of Adelaide recently submitted to a Senate enquiry that the 457 scheme had shifted in focus since its introduction in 1996 from a focus on filling high skill jobs in areas of skill shortage to satisfying broader employer demand for labour. It is worth noting that back in 1996, Labour Market Testing was a requirement of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Hotels Association underlines this shift in recently arguing for a lowering of the minimum salary threshold of $51,400, such that employers in their industry could use the scheme more extensively. I remind the Chamber that in the past 12 months the use of 457s in the hospitality industry has doubled – yes, it has doubled in the past year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill, together with the package of reforms announced in February 2013, seeks to realign the program to ensure a balance between job opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents, enabling employers to fill skills shortages, while protecting overseas workers.  The measures will be implemented in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the Subclass 457 visa program is to address genuine shortages without displacing employment and training opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents and without serving as the mainstay of the skilled migration program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government has concerns that some employers are turning to overseas workers first, rather than investing in local training and recruitment.  There has also been evidence of some sponsors paying overseas workers below the market rate, failing to commit to the training requirements of the program, and using the visa fraudulently to help family and friends migrate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In February, the Government announced a package of reforms to the Subclass 457 visa program to strengthen its capacity to identify and prevent employer practices that are not in keeping with the intent of the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms will build on the Worker Protection reforms of 2009 that introduced a sponsorship framework designed to ensure that the working conditions of sponsored visa holders meet Australian standards and provided certain cost incentives to encourage employers to seek to recruit Australians before looking to sponsor overseas skilled workers.  The 2009 reforms also introduced a civil penalty regime, including infringement notices to enhance the powers of the Department to take action against sponsors who fail to meet their sponsorship obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed changes to the Migration Regulations will seek to reduce the risk of nominations for non-genuine positions; strengthen the market salary rate requirement; align the English language requirement with that of the permanent Employer Nomination Scheme; introduce an obligation that sponsors meet the training requirement for the term of sponsorship approval; remove potential for the exploitation of temporary overseas skilled workers; and restore public confidence in the program.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendment will also allow the Minister to publish enforceable undertakings on the Department's website.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A key objective of this Bill is to strengthen the government's capacity to manage the Temporary Sponsored Work visa program (in particular, the Subclass 457 visa program).  It will seek assurance from employers that they are only utilising the 457 visa program in circumstances where there is a genuine skills shortage in Australia.  To enable this outcome, the Bill introduces a requirement that sponsors must undertake Labour Market Testing in relation to nominated occupations, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition that the Subclass 457 visa is the primary visa that delivers our World Trade Organization and Free Trade Agreement obligations for the Movement of Natural Persons, the Bill ensures that Australia continues to meet our obligations not to Labour Market Test certain categories of persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill allows the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to determine by legislative instrument how to give effect to relevant categories of persons for whom international obligations are owed.  The legislative instrument will reflect the relevant commitments with respect to Labour Market Testing under Australia's international trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The labour market testing requirement will be met if the Minister is satisfied that a suitably qualified Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or eligible temporary visa holder is not readily available to fill the nominated position.  An eligible temporary visa holder is defined as a person who, at the time the application for the nomination is made, holds a Work and Holiday (462) visa or a Working Holiday (417) visa and who is lawfully employed in the agricultural sector by the sponsor (or an associated entity of the sponsor).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is proposed that the Labour Market Testing requirement will initially require a sponsor to demonstrate that they have sought to find a suitably qualified Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident anytime within the four months prior to submission of an application for nomination approval.  There has been some misinformation regarding the time period; so I reiterate, labour market testing can be undertaken anytime within the four months prior to application for nomination approval, it is not required to be undertaken for four months.   This will provide a balance between giving Australians the opportunity to apply for jobs, and ensuring that Australian businesses do not experience undue delays in filling skilled labour shortages which would negatively impact on their businesses.  As part of the evidentiary requirement, a sponsor may include research on labour market trends generally and in relation to relevant occupations that was released in the four months prior to a sponsor lodging a nomination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Bill proposes a mandatory requirement for sponsors to provide information if one or more Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents were made redundant or retrenched from positions in the nominated occupation in a sponsor's business or associated entity in the four months prior to lodging a nomination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If there have been redundancies or retrenchments, labour market testing must be undertaken by the sponsor after those redundancies and retrenchments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the evidentiary requirements for sponsors, the Bill proposes that it be mandatory for a sponsor to provide information about their attempts to recruit suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents to the position and any similar positions.  Sponsors must also provide details of any advertising (paid or unpaid) of the position, and any similar positions, commissioned or authorised by the approved sponsor, and fees and other expenses paid (or payable) for that advertising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the approved sponsor elects to provide evidence and information other than evidence of advertising and fees, or payment of fees, to support their claim to have tested the labour market, the Minister may take that evidence into account.  The nomination will not, however, be treated less favourably if the approved sponsor elects not to provide such additional evidence or information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill proposes a delayed commencement for the Labour Market Testing requirement to allow sufficient time for the implementation of Labour Market Testing and ensure that sponsors are given a period of time to undertake Labour Market Testing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Bill includes an exemption to the Labour Market Testing requirement in the event of a major disaster, natural or otherwise, in order to assist disaster relief or recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This exemption will give the government flexibility to respond to situations of national or state emergency and would facilitate the speedy entry of overseas skilled workers without the delay caused by requiring a sponsor to undertake labour market testing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill allows for skill and occupational exemptions to the labour market testing requirement to apply to specific occupations, by legislative instrument, within Skill Levels 1 or 2 as currently described in the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations.  The legislation will however, require that nominations made by approved sponsors requiring either or both experience or a qualification in engineering (including shipping engineering) or nursing cannot be exempt from labour market testing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At present all primary Subclass 457 visa holders are subject to visa condition 8107 which provides the visa holder must not cease employment for 28 consecutive days.  If a visa holder does not comply with this condition there are grounds to cancel their visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill amends the Migration Regulations 1994 to extend the period from 28 days to 90 consecutive days, enabling a more socially just outcome for visa holders as they will have more time find an alternative job with an employer sponsor or to arrange their personal affairs at the conclusion of sponsored employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment is in line with recommendations of the 2008 Deegan review of the Subclass 457 visa program and the Migration Council Australia in its report of 11 May 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, to ensure that the views of relevant stakeholders are considered in any regulatory changes to the Subclass 457 visa program, and in recognition of the advisory function of the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, the Bill proposes the inclusion of the requirement that the Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure that, at all times, there is in existence the Migration Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, a body which includes representatives of unions, industry and State and Territory governments and other members if any nominated by the Minister, and that meets at least on a quarterly basis.  Without limiting the functions, the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration is to provide advice to the Minister in relation to the temporary sponsored work visa program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government intends to review the efficacy of these reforms within three years of their implementation to ascertain whether further refinements are required. We have some major changes in our labour market over recent years and it is appropriate that we re-examine these policy settings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The totality of the Government's reforms will close loopholes in the current legislative and policy settings to ensure that the program can only be used by appropriately skilled persons and to fill genuine skills shortages as was intended.  Put another way, they aim to ensure the program better meets its overarching intent of acting as a supplement to rather than a substitute for the Australian labour market, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government is confident that the revised legislative and policy settings for the Subclass 457 program will achieve this balance, and will further enhance an already successful program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</span>

The sisterhood may have taken out one of their own the other night; the Labor leadership may have changed and you may now have Prime Minister Rudd; but, within the first 24 hours of Prime Minister Rudd reassuming the leadership, there is one thing that the Australian public have learnt and that is: they may have changed the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, but they have not changed their direction.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an example. If Mr Rudd had really meant it the other night when he said, 'I want to do a deal with business; I want to work with business,' this is the first piece of legislation he would have pulled. This legislation is nothing more and nothing less than the CFMEU, Minister O'Connor and former Prime Minister Gillard getting together without any consultation whatsoever with industry and without any regard for their own Office of Best Practice Regulation, which said, 'You have to assess regulatory impact in relation to this legislation.' No way—why do that when you can come to this place, stitch up a deal with your little mates in the Greens, the green doormat, and slam this legislation through the Senate with 3½ minutes of debate?</span>

There goes EMILY's List now, walking up to the table. This is what the sisterhood in the Labor Party do.

This is the bill that says to the Australian people: nothing has changed at the top. You can take the photograph away and put up another photograph, but guess what? Unless you change the direction of your policy, unless you realise that you have made mistakes, the Australian people will judge you. When you have a piece of legislation as important as this being slammed through the Senate with 3½ minutes of debate, if that does not say the union movement controls the ALP, I do not know what does.</span>

This part amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to establish a selection committee to select and nominate to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry possible members of the board of the Authority.

Government support developed in an ad hoc manner until, in 1989, John Kerin and the Hawke Government had the foresight to establish the research and development corporation model. The research and development corporations, or 'RDCs', were established under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989</span> (the Act). For 24 years, our investment in the RDCs has boosted the productivity and sustainability of rural industries. This bill will make improvements to the existing RDC model and ensure it remains responsive and adapted to our needs. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are 15 RDCs providing services to a diverse range of rural industries. RDCs provide the mechanism for industry to invest collectively in research, development and extension. Government assists by establishing and collecting a levy if an industry requests this. After recovering costs, the government returns levy funds to the relevant RDC. To encourage this investment, the government matches the RDC's eligible research and development (R&amp;D) spending up to legislated limits. In the next financial year almost $250 million will be invested by the government in rural innovation in this way. Our collaborative model is unique, viewed with envy overseas and benefits all Australians by encouraging profitable and sustainable rural industries.</span>

There are also opportunities such as increasing exports of Australian agricultural products, particularly to Asia. To ensure our own food security, economic stability and the health of our agricultural resources, the RDC model needs to be updated in line with our changing needs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our rural research and development model has proven results, with Australian rural productivity increasing at more than double the rate of other Australian industries over recent decades. The high level of industry engagement and the strong support the RDC model enjoys from all sectors make it unique among research funding models around the world. Research, development and extension have a vital role in preparing Australian rural industries for the future challenges and opportunities we face together.</span>

If an industry wishes to increase its levy rate above the legislated maximum, it is currently a time consuming and costly process. This will often result in levy increases taking effect much later than is desirable, given the circumstances to which they respond.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill draws national attention to the experience of homelessness, and voices the aspiration that all Australians have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing. This is in line with the objective expressed within the National Affordable Housing Agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories, and local government.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill acknowledges the direct relationship between addressing homelessness and social inclusion. It sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed, and the strategies we see as necessary to reduce homelessness.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation that is introduced today has been strengthened through a two month public exposure period in mid-2012 – and we express our gratitude to those many people who lodged written submissions on the exposure draft of the Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All suggestions made have been carefully considered, and the Bill has been refined as a result. In particular, the definition of homelessness has been improved in light of comments from stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have now clarified that people staying in crisis accommodation (such as a refuge or shelter) cannot be ruled out of the definition through any concept of 'choice' – we know all too well that people do not choose homelessness by living in crisis accommodation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The definition of homelessness now also recognises that safety must be recognised as a vital element in a person's living circumstances. Some people may be homeless because they have no safe place to live, even if they have a usual address. for example, a person who is living temporarily with friends or relatives and cannot return home safely because of domestic violence will now be recognised by the legislation as experiencing homelessness. this preserves an element of the previous legislative definition particularly valued by stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Stakeholder feedback has also been reflected in the bill in important matters such as the range of factors recognised as contributing to homelessness, and in the commonwealth's aspiration for all Australians to have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This new legislation will replace the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994, which set out important principles and guided the Commonwealth's response to homelessness in Australia for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That Act recognised people who are homeless as one of the most powerless and marginalised groups in society. It made clear the Parliament's view that support should be provided in a way that respects people's dignity as individuals, enhances their self-esteem, is sensitive to their social and economic circumstances, and respects their cultural backgrounds and beliefs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new legislation preserves the best features of the 1994 Act. The Homelessness Bill 2013 gives us the opportunity to retain in law the important statements about homelessness, the partnerships, effort and strategies that are needed to tackle it, and the treatment and support that vulnerable Australians deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 1994 Act was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to administer the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. However, new arrangements were introduced in 2009 under the federal financial relations framework, superseding the funding mechanism under the 1994 Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This current funding framework for Commonwealth, state and territory efforts to reduce homelessness – with funding provided through Commonwealth state mechanisms such as the National Partnership on Homelessness and the National Affordable Housing Specific Purpose Payment – will continue. That funding framework is the vehicle for the practical steps Australia is taking in support of its international obligation to realise progressively the right to adequate housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is therefore complementary to the comprehensive funding arrangements already in place, and is not a funding instrument in itself. The Gillard Government continues to work with states and territories on the best possible funding outcomes under the existing framework and the substantial measures that flow from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, the Bill is just one part of a bigger policy program of support to people who are homeless or at risk of it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The issue of service quality is being pursued by working with states and territories to develop a non-legislative Homelessness National Quality Framework. This framework is being developed with the benefit of consultations and workshop sessions with service providers and stakeholders and individual interviews with homeless people. The framework will be the primary strategy for the White Paper goal of ensuring quality services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has committed around $5 billion in new funding since 2008 to provide support services and programs to help people who are homeless or at risk.</span>
                </p>

If we are going to be on the other side of the table from each other, then I had probably better deliver on that deal.

I really appreciate what she has done for me in that regard. I also knowledge her enormous contribution and knowledge when it comes to Indigenous affairs. Senator Humphries's sometimes quiet manner belied the rapier-like nature of his questioning. He was a worthy opponent, and I wish him well. Senator Joyce and I have had one of the more interesting relationships in this place, and I have to say that it is with mixed views that I regard his leaving the chamber. I wish him all the very best.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Senate's indulgence, I will make a couple of very brief comments about Senator Conroy and Senator Ludwig. As I said before, Senator Conroy is a man of great Labor heart and a very worthy leader of the government in the Senate, and I wish him well. I am pleased that he is continuing to serve. Senator Ludwig is a friend who has always been fantastic. He is someone who has given me great advice. He is a very honourable man, and I acknowledge his service on the frontbench. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I rise to speak on adjournment for the last time in this 43rd session of parliament. I think I am the last speaker to speak in this 43rd session of parliament, a parliament that has been one of the most constructive in the nation's history. Among the many achievements of this parliament have been its victories for the environment, from putting a price on carbon pollution to the declaration of the world's largest network of marine parks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the processes initiated in this term of parliament and government reached its culmination only this week. On Monday, 24 June, UNESCO recognised over 170,000 hectares of Tasmania's old growth forest as among the world's most special places. In supporting the Labor government's nomination of these forests for world heritage status, UNESCO has declared that they are the common estate of humanity and deserving of the highest protection. These forests are the legacy of the ancient landforms of Gondwana, and hundreds of thousands of years of nature uninterrupted. They include the Styx Valley, only 70 kilometres from Hobart and home to some of the tallest hardwood trees in the world, stretching over 25 storeys into the air and five metres wide at their bases. The Styx-Tyenna area contains the greatest concentration of these trees in the world. It includes the unique biodiversity in the Upper Florentine, Huon and Picton, and includes areas from Cockle Creek in the far south of Tasmania to Cradle Mountain in the north-west. Habitats for rare and threatened species, such as the endangered wedge-tailed eagle, the white form of the grey goshawk, and the Tasmanian devil are also included in the new boundaries for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Geology that tells the history of our world is also included—places that exhibit evidence of glacial movement along the Walls of Jerusalem and Central Plateau millions of years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have walked along these rock faces and among these giants, and they are some of the most beautiful and moving places on earth. There is no doubt in my mind that they are worthy of protection. But declaring these sites of shared significance is no simple decision. Common human heritage requires common human understanding about the meaning of these places, and for at least the last 30 years Tasmania's forests have been the subject of bitter community conflict. This declaration has been made possible by traditional protagonists from the conservation movement and the forestry industry being willing to sit down together and negotiate together. Through the community-driven process concluding in the Tasmanian forests agreement, both parties were able to focus on the best results for the future. And when they had reached that agreement, they were supported by the federal Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are not only conservation gains in this agreement, though. The agreement is underwritten by an understanding of the value of Tasmania's forests to industry and to families that depend on forestry jobs. Importantly, the Tasmanian forests agreement provides greater certainty for Tasmanians working in the forestry industry, giving industry players certainty and providing space and resources to restructure in a way that can build a better future and assure jobs. One of our most important job providers in the state, Ta Ann, whose capacity underpins the success of many operators, will be able to access $26 million to restructure their business in response to market changes and the changing face of Tasmanian forestry. Economic diversification projects, new and innovative developments in affected parts of the state, and structural adjustment programs to allow people to transition or exit out of the industry are just some of the outcomes of this agreement which will benefit workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, what will be facilitated by this agreement, including the World Heritage Committee's decision this week, is the end of community division over Tasmania's forests. Tasmania's forests have always been important to Tasmanians—to those who were awed by their transcendent beauty and to those families who were sustained by their bounty. Preserving the precious value of our forests is a joint aim now. Now, with the extension of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, it is the aim of our nation and our world as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn my attention now to the new National Asbestos Exposure Register. Firstly, I want to commend Minister Bill Shorten, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, for setting up the register in the wake of community concerns after asbestos was found in Telstra pits during the rollout of the National Broadband Network. Residents near some of these pits have expressed fears that they might have been exposed to potentially deadly asbestos fibres, and at least one family in Sydney moved to a hotel after asbestos was found on their front lawn after it was removed incorrectly from a Telstra pit. The parents feared that their children might have brought the asbestos into the house on their shoes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are around two million pits across Australia; they are in almost every footpath. It is estimated that asbestos is in around 10 per cent of these pits. Telstra owns these pits and has accepted responsibility for pit remediation work. Telstra is also working with NBN contractors to ensure that all workers are trained in the removal and handling of asbestos in pits and pipes—trained adequately and properly. In this aim, they are providing 200 experts to oversee the work across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that Minister Shorten moved so quickly to address community concerns regarding asbestos removal from the underground pits and to set up the National Asbestos Exposure Register. The minister convened an urgent meeting of Telstra, union representatives, contractors and asbestos support groups and created a task force to develop a new training standard for asbestos removal. Telstra and NBN Co. have confirmed that they are working with the unions and Comcare to ensure that all Telstra and NBN employees and contractors are trained in the safe removal and handling of asbestos from Telstra pits. With this National Asbestos Exposure Register, anyone who is exposed can register where and when it occurred. We know that it can be up to 20 years before any asbestos related disease comes to light, so it is essential that anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to asbestos puts their name on the register.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The register has been established by the government's Office of Asbestos Safety, with assistance from the Chief Medical Officer. In Australia we have a national approach to asbestos, including establishing the national Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency and the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Council. This historic legislation passed the Senate last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the day the legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives a truck driver in Sydney was caught on CCTV dumping asbestos outside a childcare centre. This illegal dumping of waste carries fines of between $750 and $1 million and up to seven years imprisonment. The local Sydney council spent $13,000 cleaning up the area after the alarm was raised, but the council says finding the person who dumped the asbestos is like 'trying to find a needle in a haystack'. Dumping of asbestos continues to happen and is putting people at risk. It highlights why we need a national approach to dealing with asbestos and its safe removal. After the media coverage of the asbestos in the Telstra pits, my office in Hobart had a call from a man who was worried about dumping of asbestos in the Hobart Domain. However, incidents of dumping near childcare centres and the concern with Telstra pits again highlight just why we need a national approach and a national agency and council to try to eradicate asbestos from workplaces and public buildings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, unfortunately, has one of the highest rates of asbestos related deaths in the world and this will continue to rise if we do not safeguard our community from asbestos. Removal of asbestos should be above politics—the health and safety of Australians are too important to see it politicised. Therefore, I commend the government for establishing the first National Asbestos Exposure Register as well as the national asbestos agency.</span>
