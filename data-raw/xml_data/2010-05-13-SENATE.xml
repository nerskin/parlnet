<para>—I am speaking to a motion. In doing so I recognise that the three signatures on the motion mean that we would not have a majority in the chamber. We would then waste time by going through a procedural motion which the government would lose. The government does not support the reference of these matters to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the reference appear to be a direct investigation into a state election, without any reference to the Commonwealth Electoral Act or the Australian Electoral Commission. As such, this inquiry should be undertaken by the South Australian parliament. If not rejected, this would indicate to all state and territory parliaments that they have the right to investigate Commonwealth elections for partisan political purposes. This matter is a reference to a Commonwealth body and it should relate to Commonwealth matters.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Shortly after the first four paragraphs of the reference were reported to the media I asked the AEC for a briefing on these allegations and whether similar alleged conduct would be in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC advised that these alleged activities would more likely than not be in breach of the act. However, in order to remove all doubt and to ensure that electors are made aware of on whose behalf how-to-vote cards are distributed, I requested the AEC to prepare possible amendments to the act. These amendments, which I table now, improve the authorisation requirements under the act so that it is made clear at the top of how-to-vote cards whether or not the card is being distributed on behalf of a political party or candidate. I will be seeking support for the amendments when further electoral legislation is debated in June and, of course, I look forward to the support of the movers of this reference for those amendments which make this inquiry unnecessary.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, I had very little time to be able to address the reference or hold consultations on it. Had I been afforded that opportunity I would have advised those supporting the motion that paragraphs (e) and (f) seem to be matters that should be dealt with by the relevant state authority and not matters that the Commonwealth should inquire into. Paragraphs (a) to (d) are clearly matters that raise concern. I expect Senator Fielding, having looked at that issue in detail, would acknowledge that the government has looked at acting to ensure that how-to-vote cards are dealt with in an appropriate manner and that the matter will be dealt with during the June sitting. If those amendments were to be a standalone bill, I would ask the opposition to indicate that they would not oppose any cut-off motion so that we can also deal with them.</para>

<para>—We will look at any amendments that the Special Minister of State wants to bring forward to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. From what he has said to me, I do not think this addresses in any way the matter that was the concern of Senator Xenophon, Senator Fielding and me and which led to this reference. Unless my colleagues tell me otherwise in light of these amendments, in my view we should continue to pursue this matter through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It was disgraceful, inexcusable behaviour in the South Australian election. We think it is intolerable and we think the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is the body that should fully investigate the matter in the terms of the motion.</para>

<para>—This is a very serious issue, and we hear the Labor Party trying to weasel out of it. They ran around impersonating Family First in South Australia, and the Prime Minister has not got the guts to rule it out at the federal election. He should have come out the same day and ruled out doing these dirty tricks at this upcoming federal election. It was wrong. I am not just upset with the fact that they looked better than our people did! That was crazy. Maybe they got a discount on the shirts.

<para>—As a co-sponsor of this motion, I think what occurred in the South Australian election is something that needs to be looked at at a federal level. These terms of reference will deal with that. I note that the South Australian premier has indicated concerns and that there may well be changes to the South Australian Electoral Act so that this sort of thing does not occur again. Obviously Senator Brown is in a much better position to discuss this, but in previous years there was misleading conduct in relation to people saying they were Greens or associated with the Greens. I have heard stories about that occurring in years gone by. One of the problems that we have in relation to section 329 of the Electoral Act at the moment is that it deals with the issue of printed material. T-shirts are not included as printed material. I have drafted an amendment to the Electoral Act to include the issue of conduct and have forwarded copies of that to my colleagues. I would like to think it is something that will have bipartisan support, because clearly what occurred in South Australia indicates a problem: the possibility of abuse. I do not think anyone in this chamber would want to go down that path. For the next federal election I think it is important. We have been alerted to it; now we need to deal with it. That is why I support and have, in fact, co-sponsored these terms of reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.</para>

<para>—The Greens likewise will support any motion to clean up the rampant misrepresentation which goes on in the run to both state and federal elections and which is engaged in by the major political parties on both sides. We have seen from the Liberal Party in the past the electoral how-to-vote cards handed out that can confuse the voters into thinking they are coming from the Greens. But what is not covered in this motion is the deception of people in the run to elections through specifically targeted negative advertising. The Labor Party has become the doyenne of this deceptive activity. We saw it in the Tasmanian elections. We saw it in the South Australian elections. We saw it in the seat of Mitchell in South Australia, where arguably it changed the outcome of that election. On all occasions the Labor Party labelled its opponents—Liberal, Green or Independent—as wanting to promote illegal drugs and/or relationships with prisoners who had committed heinous crimes and who were in jail. We can expect more of it because it seems that it works, and it is not until we get truth in advertising and an end to the deliberate setting up of opponents, which seems to be coordinated and rampant in the Labor Party nationally, that we will get some protection for voters from this highly planned, misleading advertising.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senator Fielding himself came in in an election in which his party is alleged to have spent a million dollars repeatedly advertising in my home state that I wanted to give drugs to children. So Family First is not clean from this tendency to want to besmirch untruthfully opponents in the run to elections. We should stop it. There is not in this proposal a motion for truth in advertising in the run to elections. There should be, and it is something the Greens—apparently alone, though perhaps with Senator Xenophon—will be campaigning for in the run to this election and consequently.</para>

<para class="italic">The speech read as follows—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australia has a binge drinking problem which is killing Australians, particularly young Australians. and compromising the safety of our streets.</para>
<para class="block">Every week we read about another case of alcohol fuelled violence or of another tragic death on our roads from drink driving.</para>
<para class="block">Our binge drinking culture is a major social and health issue and Australians are beginning to wake up and say enough already.</para>
<para class="block">The extent of this problem goes further than people think and the statistics to back it up are simply horrifying.</para>
<para class="block">Alcohol causes almost 4,300 deaths each year and costs almost 400,000 hospital bed days per year. It accounts for around 40 per cent of police work and is the cause of one in five deaths on our roads.</para>
<para class="block">Binge drinking robs our society to the tune of $16 billion a year, and also inflicts an enormous emotional cost—splitting families apart and destroying relationships.</para>
<para class="block">In a survey released last year, the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation revealed that more than 80 per cent of Australians recognise that as a society we have a drinking problem and that 85 per cent of Australians want more done to fix that problem.</para>
<para class="block">In April last year, the Brumby Labor Government was forced to hold an emergency summit because the alcohol-fuelled violence in Melbourne was spiralling out of control.</para>
<para class="block">Since then, things have only gotten worse.</para>
<para class="block">One of the factors which is making this problem worse are the 24 hour takeaway alcohol stores operating around Melbourne which let younger people load up on cheap alcohol around the clock and then spill out onto the streets.</para>
<para class="block">It’s no wonder there is so much violence on our streets when you don’t have proper regulations controlling these outlets selling packaged liquor.</para>
<para class="block">In my home state of Victoria there are 144 licensees allowed to serve alcohol around the clock and 37 such outlets sell packaged liquor.</para>
<para class="block">This is outrageous and should not be allowed to continue to exist.</para>
<para class="block">The Responsible Takeaway Alcohol Hours Bill is a major piece of legislation and will go a long way to curbing the alcohol fuelled violence which has taken over our streets.</para>
<para class="block">Under this legislation, it will be prohibited to sell takeaway alcohol after midnight and before 7am in the morning.</para>
<para class="block">Any business caught doing this will be up for a fine of $10,000.</para>
<para class="block">Stopping the sale of takeaway alcohol at all hours of the night is long overdue and it’s crazy that it has taken so long to address this issue.</para>
<para class="block">This policy has the support of numerous public health groups and no doubt many parents too.</para>
<para class="block">Geoff Munro from the Community Alcohol Action Network has said previously,</para>
<para class="block">“In the interests of reducing the mayhem on the streets, assaults, the glassings, people suffering brain damage and even dying after being king hit on the street, it doesn’t seem an unreasonable limitation that people should not be able to buy alcohol right through the night”.</para>
<para class="block">There’s no silver bullet solution to our alcohol-related violence, but this bill is certainly a very important first step.</para>
<para class="block">Last year we saw the ridiculous situation where the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal gave the green light to the Exford Hotel to continue selling packaged liquor all night.</para>
<para class="block">This was despite the fact that the tribunal was referred to 30 examples of public drunkenness and disorderly and drunken behaviour outside or around the hotel.</para>
<para class="block">Clearly the laws in place at the moment are not strong enough to deal with the problems facing our streets and the Responsible Takeaway Alcohol Hours Bill will help address this issue.</para>
<para class="block">This bill makes it perfectly clear that if you are a business that sells takeaway alcohol, then after midnight it’s time to shut up shop.</para>
<para class="block">People who are loading themselves up on alcohol at two, three or four in the morning are people who are more likely to get into trouble and cause problems on our streets.</para>
<para class="block">Allowing the sale of takeaway alcohol at all hours of the night only undoes a lot of the hard work done by our brave police force to keep our streets safe and free of violence.</para>
<para class="block">As a father of three children, I know that I worry about their safety when they are out late at night, because of the surging violence on our streets.</para>
<para class="block">Restricting the hours of sale of takeaway alcohol is a move that will bring a sigh of relief to thousands of mums and dads across the country and is a policy that should be supported by both sides of Parliament.</para>

<para class="block">There is no denying that this organisation’s tax-exempt status needs to be examined. If the stories I have heard are true, and I believe they are, then the Church of Scientology does not deserve the tax-payer support it receives.</para>
<para class="block">Scientology needs to be open and transparent, and to prove that the good they do in the community outweighs the harm.</para>
<para class="block">But the public benefit test is not limited to the Church of Scientology. Under this legislation, all religious or charitable organisations will have to come clean about what they do—both the good and the bad.</para>
<para class="block">After all, daylight is the best disinfectant.</para>
<para class="block">Previously, the Government has responded to calls for a public benefit test with the line that they did not want to pre-empt any recommendations that may have been made in the Henry Tax Review.</para>
<para class="block">Well, the Henry Review is out and, in line with a Productivity Commission report earlier this year, it calls for a National Charities Commission to monitor, regulate and streamline tax concessions for not-for-profit organisations.</para>
<para class="block">But the Government has chosen to ignore this recommendation, and similar recommendations from previous reports saying the same thing.</para>
<para class="block">In the United Kingdom, a Charity Commission has been in place since 2006. Part of this organisation’s role is to administer the public benefit test.</para>
<para class="block">I quote from the Commission’s website:</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-style="italic">To be a charity an organisation must have purposes or (‘aims’) all of which are exclusively charitable; a charity cannot have some purposes which are charitable and others which are not.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">In a foreword on the Charity Commission’s website, the Chief Executive writes:</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-style="italic">Perhaps more than any other sector of society, charities can command public trust. Charities are fortunate to be in this position and we, as their regulator, have a responsibility to ensure that this trust is maintained and even, if possible, increased. It is important for civil society that this trust is not taken for granted, but is actively valued, earned and continually renewed.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Part of being a charity, or not-for-profit organisation, relies on public trust.</para>
<para class="block">The Commission goes on to outline the purpose of the test, which it says is to:</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-style="italic">explain the requirement that, to be a charity in England and Wales, an organisation must have charitable aims that are for the public benefit;</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-style="italic">raise awareness and understanding of that public benefit requirement amongst the public and the charitable sector;</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-style="italic">explain how the public benefit requirement operates in practice; and</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-style="italic">explain the new requirement for charity trustees to report on public benefit.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Offering tax exemptions says, on the part of the Government and on behalf of taxpayers, ‘we acknowledge the work you do, and support you in your aims’.</para>
<para class="block">But the way things stand right now, we don’t know what those aims are, other than what websites and glossy brochures tell us.</para>
<para class="block">When we’re dealing with our own money, we can look at those websites and brochures, look at annual reports and talk to people face to face before we decide to make a donation.</para>
<para class="block">And if something doesn’t look quite right, we have the choice to walk away.</para>
<para class="block">But when the Government is effectively making donations on our behalf through tax exemptions, we just have to take the organisation’s word that they’re working in the public good.</para>
<para class="block">I’m not saying that all religions and charities out there are rorting the system.</para>
<para class="block">Far from it.</para>
<para class="block">Many of them provide vitally important services to the community, working in the areas of society most of us try not to think about too deeply, often for little more than the satisfaction of doing a good deed.</para>
<para class="block">These are the organisations that deserve taxpayer support.</para>
<para class="block">And they deserve acknowledgement that they are using that support in the way it is meant to be used.</para>
<para class="block">The public benefit test is not new, it is not unheard of, and it is not a threat.</para>
<para class="block">It is simply a tool to encourage public confidence in the not-for-profit sector, and a means for the Government to ensure its support is not being abused.</para>
<para class="block">In the end, it is simply a way of letting in the daylight.</para>

<para>—The Commonwealth government has reached an agreement on health reform with all states and territories, except Western Australia, which represents the biggest change to our health system since the introduction of Medicare. These changes are the end result of a comprehensive structural review of Australia’s health and hospital system by the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, an extensive consultation process to test the report’s recommendation and consultation and intense negotiations with states and territories culminating in the COAG agreement of 20 April. Just two days ago we released a budget that fully funds the health reform investments.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This referral to committee around the detail of the agreement is a duplication of the significant effort that has already taken place. In fact, we believe that the detail sought by Senator Fierravanti-Wells could be found within the publicly released documents which are in existence. These include the intergovernmental agreement on 20 April 2010; the document, <inline font-style="italic">A national health and hospitals network for Australia’s future—delivering better health and better hospitals</inline>, released on 11 May 2010, which I table, and the 2010-2011 budget papers. Within that documentation are key milestones for implementing the various elements of the agreement. These clearly outline those areas where further consultation and negotiation will take place with states and territories and with key stakeholders prior to details being finalised. For these reasons the government opposes the motion.</para>

<para>—I thank the government for pointing out that it is the coalition and the Greens who want to see an inquiry into the NAPLAN testing. Clearly, this process has been a poorly managed by the government. I would really like to have seen the government commit to a public inquiry into this issue as well. I think it is sad, in fact, that the government does not want the transparency of a public inquiry, and I am sure that will continue to be raised throughout the course of this committee process. I think it is poor that the government will not want an inquiry into something which they say is essential and important, and which they stand by. It is quite a reflection on how concerned they are about how these test results are being used.</para>

<para>—The government is committed to developing a population strategy that considers pressures on infrastructure, services and the environment. It is also an opportunity to look at managing the pressures of an ageing population by providing the skills and innovation needed to underpin continued economic growth.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It is important that sustainable growth improve our standard of living and preserve our unique environment. To help guide the development of future policies, the Prime Minister announced on 3 April 2010 the appointment of the Hon. Tony Burke MP to the new office of Minister for Population in the Treasury portfolio. Minister Burke’s initial task will be to develop Australia’s first comprehensive population strategy over the next 12 months. The strategy will consider the social and economic infrastructure Australia will need to support a growing population, including the roads, housing and service delivery network. As an early priority it will also consider maximising opportunities for the Australian people. This inquiry proposed by Senator Brown will duplicate this important body of work that the government is committed to delivering.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we will oppose this notice of motion. It is not because we disagree with its intent; indeed, many of the clauses that are contained in this notice of motion are consistent with the coalition’s population policy, which has been detailed and released. I would note that we are the only mainstream party that has a comprehensive population policy in place ahead of the next election.</para>

<para>Our objection to this is that it presupposes that Australia has an ability to influence and slow global population growth which, quite frankly, beggars belief at a most reasonable level. Australia certainly has an ability to influence its own population growth at this point, but whether we should be slowing population growth globally is something of much broader consideration. The coalition did seek to amend this motion. The Greens, unfortunately, were not amenable to amending it, so the coalition is not able to support this motion at this time.</para>

<para>—If Senator Brown had his way, he would have Australia moving towards China’s one-child policy. It is a joke. This is Australia. It is a free country and I plan to keep it that way. The only way we can do that is by stopping the Greens from ever holding the balance of power in this Senate. I am serious here. If anyone out there believes in a free country, do not vote for the Greens because this motion does move us towards China’s one-child policy. It is just ridiculous. Motions like this smack of communism and that is the reason why Family First will not support this motion.</para>

<para>—Unusual things happen in politics, and I am always amazed at Senator Fielding’s ability to turn a very serious matter into a light-hearted one and to have everybody around the chamber laughing. I thank him for that at this stage of today’s proceedings.</para>

<para>The Greens are a mainstream party and we are putting forward an important means of drawing upon the wit and wisdom of all Australians in developing population policy. The Greens do have a population policy. I think it is very moderate and inadequate. If you go to their websites you will find that, contrary to what Senator Bernardi said, there is no population policy from the coalition or from the government—although we are pleased that the Prime Minister has now established a population ministry. But how is the ministry going to work if it is not informed?</para>
<para>Here we are saying: ‘Let’s have an independent inquiry and get everybody’s viewpoints and the expertise of the nation brought to bear.’ It is, after all, a motion that is consequent upon the advice of Barry Jones and the House of Representatives inquiry into population in 1994. This is not new territory. It was Labor policy at least after that inquiry and it ought to be getting endorsement now. Instead of that, from the coalition, the government and the Family First entity we are getting complete negativity. They do not want to know about it, they do not want to have an independent inquiry and they do not want to be properly informed. It is not a good way of formulating national policy on a matter as important as this.</para>
<para>When it comes to international population growth, there is a set formula. I say to Senator Bernardi, the more we put into overseas aid—particularly literacy for women and the ability for them to engage in small investments and businesses—the quicker we see populations steady down for the health of all— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Given some of the other statements that have been made, I indicate that I support this inquiry. I think we do need to be informed. I happen to believe that we do need to have a sensible, sustained population growth in this country, particularly with an ageing population, in order to have a sufficient balance of the younger demographic to ensure they can pay for the pensions of older Australians. I do not see this as being anti population growth as such. It is about having a debate on this very important issue. Such an inquiry would look at issues of urban design, suburban sprawl and the sustainability and liveability of our city centres. I think that is a sensible thing to do. It should be seen in the context of an ageing population in this country. We do need to make plans for the future as to what mix we want in the context of the intergenerational challenge that has been referred to in previous Commonwealth government reports. I think this is a sensible move. I do not see this as having anything to do with China, a one-child policy or anything like that. I think we should have this debate.</para>

<para>—The government believes the motion is not appropriate. Key documents relating to Australia’s future tax system are already public. The government released the final report of the panel on 2 May 2010. On 2 May it also released its long-term tax plan entitled Stronger, Fairer, Simpler: Tax Plan for our Future. This is the first instalment of the government’s response. The package includes numerous informative fact sheets that may be of assistance to Senator Abetz. The second instalment was delivered in the 2010-11 budget, when we announced further substantial tax reforms, standard deductions, a reduction in interest withholding tax and new incentives to encourage personal saving. It is important to note that Treasury then released relevant policy parameters provided to KPMG Econtech, which then independently modelled their economic effects.</para>

<para>A summary modelling report and the full report is available on the KPMG website. I know that websites are not particularly popular with Senator Abetz, but I suggest he go to the KPMG website. He does not need to go via any other pathway to Treasury officials—it is there on the KPMG website. The development of the recommendations of the independent review panel was undertaken against a background of massive community engagement. On 6 August 2008 the panel released its architecture of Australia’s tax and transfer system. On 10 December three more papers were released and public meetings were held. The panel also conducted focus groups in April 2009 to further explore some of the issues raised in the public arena. Senator Abetz can freely access all these documents at www.futuretax.gov.au and, should he need the government to supply hard copies, that can also be arranged. The government opposes the motion.</para>

<para>—This motion is essentially unnecessary. The government has been full and frank about the issues associated with the Change Program, which, I might add, commenced under the former government. It is ultimately administered by the independent ATO. Upon concerns being raised about the program, I acted and instigated the Inspector-General of Taxation review, and I acknowledge Senator Xenophon’s keen interest in the issue. The independent review should be allowed to run its course, without interference from parliament. There are various parliamentary acts under which the inspector-general acts. I would argue that parliament cannot break its own acts of parliament in attempting to instruct the inspector-general, who is fully independent and fully at arm’s length. That was the way the inspector-general was established, by the former government, so that parliament and I as minister could not influence the inspector-general once an inquiry was called. The inspector-general is unequivocally required to maintain the confidentiality of those who give information where this is requested as a result of both the Inspector-General of Taxation Act 2003 and the inspector-general’s public confirmation of this obligation, as set out in his recent advertisements seeking submissions for this inquiry. The former government established that parameter.</para>

<para>In addition, where an ATO employee indicates to the I-G that they have information relevant to the Change Program the inspector-general will formally ask the ATO employee to provide that information. The employee will then have the full protection of section 17 of the Inspector-General of Taxation Act 2003. The timing of the presentation to me of any report is a matter for the inspector-general. It is his decision. The act provides, for good reason, no power to direct a particular time frame. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—by leave—I appreciate the comments of the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law in relation to this matter, about which I have had a number of useful discussions with the minister’s office. But, with respect to the minister and to the government, the purpose of this motion is to make it clear that those tax officials who have information to give to the inspector-general, who, clearly, is independent, are given an assurance that there will be no recriminations against them from the Australian Taxation Office. There is a concern—and we know what happens to whistleblowers and of the retribution against them—that for this inquiry to be effective in relation to this very comprehensive Change Program, where there has been a cost blow-out in the hundreds of millions of dollars and chaos in terms of hundreds of thousands of returns not being processed in time, it is important that there be an assurance from the Australian tax office that there will be no recriminations against their employees for coming forward to the Inspector-General of Taxation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I commend the minister for requesting the inquiry. This motion is about ensuring that the inquiry of the Inspector-General is as effective, as fulsome and as robust as possible. There is a genuine concern that the men and women of the tax office who are at the front line of dealing with this new IT system may be reluctant to come forward without these assurances. That is why I think it is important that we go down this path and request of the tax office that they give assurances to the Senate in relation to this. Also, in relation to the timing of it: it is a request, not an order, to the Inspector-General to do so. And it is only a progress report. I think it is important that we put this in context.</para>
<para>Again, I commend the government for instigating the Inspector-General’s inquiry in relation to this. This would enhance the inquiry and enhance what I believe, genuinely, the government is trying to do—to get to the bottom of what appears to be a debacle in relation to the IT system.</para>

<para>—Those who have been following this Change Program through Senate estimates would know that I have been very interested in this program for a number of years, even under the coalition government. I had some information right upfront that this Change Program in the Australian Taxation Office was going off the rails under the coalition and the minister knows this. He has been at those estimates and knows I was asking the questions. And then to hear him on radio saying, ‘We don’t direct anything to the tax office; it is a separate sort of issue. It’s not us’—they report through to you!</para>

<para>—They report through to the government and you cannot wipe your hands clean of this program. You listened to me, a number of times, in estimates. Under the coalition, this program was a stuff-up, a real problem. Then we have had small businesses impacted because of this Change Program and you go on radio and say, ‘It’s not me; it’s the tax office.’ Well, you knew there was a problem. What were you doing about it? So this motion is very important because it allows other people to come forward—and it actually allows the public to know what is going on—without any consequences to them from doing that. I think that is very important.</para>

<para>This is a big issue. That is the reason I have been chasing this one, for quite some time, through Senate estimates. I was a little annoyed to hear someone go on radio and say, ‘It’s not me; it’s the tax office.’ But you knew there was a problem. What did you do about it? This should have been checked—double-checked—before it went out. As the minister, you should do that. You knew there were problems and it was wrong. So this is a very important issue, and I will be supporting the motion.</para>

<para>—I have had some useful discussions in the last 24 hours with Senator Ludlam, who has been very helpful, on expanding the terms of reference; with Senator Barnett, who is on the committee; and with Senator Wortley as the chair of the committee.

<para>It is helpful that the issue of an online ombudsman will be considered by this committee, because I think that that is an integral part of this. In relation to the issue of online gambling, as I understand it there will be submissions invited generally on the issue of gambling online, but I concede that it would be more appropriate for a committee looking at the Interactive Gambling Act and the issue of online gambling, to consider this at a later stage.</para>
<para>I understand the Productivity Commission report will need to be released in the next few weeks, and I can foreshadow that I will be pushing for terms of reference looking at this and issues of online gambling generally in regulation, once that report is released. So I can live with this compromise, and I am grateful for the consideration given by Senators Wortley, Barnett and Ludlam so that we can get on with this in terms of an online ombudsman being considered.</para>

<para>—Briefly in support of the motion and the amendment, the Greens had considered and would have supported the original motion as it stood—and that included the hazards of online gambling. Given the way the work of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety seems to be panning out with a specific focus on children, I certainly was not aware of the risks there. I think there will be merit, if not at this opportunity then certainly some time down the track, in making ourselves aware of what those risks are and what it is exactly that kids are being confronted with in that domain. In terms of the online ombudsman, I think that potentially is a useful piece of policy architecture. It is something that does not exist yet. I look forward to that being part of the mix and part of the debate in that joint committee on cybersafety.</para>

<para>—Since this government has been in office, Dr Henry has appeared before every Senate estimates and before Senate committees generally on many occasions. I have to say that that was not the case under the former government. There were occasions when I asked for Dr Henry to appear and he did not, but I never brought it into the chamber to insist—in the way that Senator Bushby is doing—that he must appear. I think that, in these circumstances that I will outline, it is unreasonable for such a motion to be presented to the chamber. Dr Henry has explained to the Senate estimates committee that he has an immovable family matter. He is taking leave. He must attend that family matter, and it will take him outside the country. It is a private family matter.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I am sure it would not be a surprise to anyone in this chamber that Dr Henry has a very, very heavy workload; he always has done. Particularly under this government he has had a heavy workload. In all the circumstances, it is and was appropriate for Dr Henry to receive leave because of his family circumstances. I would argue to any impartial observer that Dr Henry fairly deserves an opportunity to take the leave to be with his family. We oppose the motion and the amendment, if it should be carried. There are any number of Treasury officials who will be appearing before the Senate estimates committee who are very capable of responding to the range of questions that will be put by the opposition and the crossbench team.</para>

<para>—The opposition does not begrudge Dr Henry the opportunity to have an overseas holiday at this time. We are sure he has earned a holiday given the ad hoc way the government approaches economic issues and places demands on Dr Henry. But of course we have been reasonable in this. We have actually sought private clarification through the minister as to the nature and the timing of the trip to ensure that the circumstances leading to this are truly immovable and truly relate to circumstances that cannot be avoided. Despite making that effort, we have received no assurance that that is the case. All we have been told is what is contained in a letter from the Assistant Treasurer which we received last night—that he has unavoidable personal commitments and no further advice has been provided as to what that relates to. Given that he is not due to appear for three weeks, one can only presume that those relate to commitments that he has chosen to accept rather than those that might have been imposed on him through a sudden death or similar tragic circumstances.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The question is: why has this holiday been chosen to be taken during estimates? It has long been the case that the budget is held in the second week of May and that, after a week’s break, budget estimates occur in the two weeks following. It is not like the Secretary of the Treasury has not known when this will occur. The sittings for this year came out in November last year. He has had almost eight months to lock this into his diary and to make sure that he was available to turn up on these dates.</para>
<para>We are looking at a point in time that will be the first opportunity for the estimates committee to examine Dr Henry on the Henry review. For the last two years, he has been turning up to estimates committees and refusing to answer questions about the review because ‘it is not yet delivered’. It is now delivered; it is released. The government has responded. But it has responded dismally to the Henry review, and the people of Australia deserve the opportunity for parliament to examine Dr Henry on his review and his thoughts about the government’s approach to it.</para>

<para>—There is always a means of coming to a reasonable agreement on the basis of the information available. I do not mind what the argument is in either direction, but the amendment put forward is to enable a mutually agreeable time to be found for Dr Henry to appear before the committee, and I am sure that can be arranged. I would point out that not only did Dr Henry not always appear before the committee during the period of the coalition government but quite recently I asked for the Governor of the Reserve Bank to appear before a committee to look into the matter of the scandal surrounding Securency, which has half its board appointed by the Reserve Bank, and, if I remember correctly, the opposition voted to prevent that happening. So there is a double standard here. However, we are in favour of information being made available to the parliament when it wants it and hence the reasonable amendment that I put forward.</para>

<para>—I support this motion in its amended form. As I understand it from my discussions with Senator Brown earlier today, Dr Henry will be able to accommodate this amended request. I think it is important that we hear from the Secretary to the Treasury. He has recently completed the most comprehensive review of our tax system in many years, and I commend the government for commissioning Dr Henry to do that. I think it is important we hear from Dr Henry in relation to that. I think it would have been unreasonable to insist that he attend during estimates if he had genuine prior family commitments and I think it is important that this motion is passed and that we hear from Dr Henry before the end of the financial year.</para>

<para>—I think it is important to note that Dr Henry has probably had better attendance at estimates under the Labor government than under the coalition government. I could be wrong, but that is my belief. And I think that is a good move. I am sure that the circumstances through which Dr Henry will not be available would be serious enough for him not to appear but I think this motion does make sense. To have Dr Henry available to the Economics Legislation Committee at a mutually agreeable time on or before 30 June 2010 does make a lot of sense, and we will be supporting the motion for that. What we have to realise is that Dr Henry was tasked to take a root and branch approach. The budget is just out and this is a very important period coming up to the election. I think this is a more than reasonable motion to support.</para>

<para class="centre">
<inline ref="R4164">Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The purpose of the <inline ref="R4164">Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010</inline> is to establish the Office of the Information Commissioner.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill will implement the structural reforms outlined in the Government’s election commitment, Government information: restoring trust and integrity. Together with the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010, it constitutes the second stage of the Rudd Government’s overhaul of FOI.</para>
<para class="block">The new Office of the Australian Information Commissioner will bring together the independent oversight functions for privacy protection (principally regulated by the Privacy Act 1988) and for access to government information (regulated by the Freedom of Information Act 1982). The Government considers that the co-location of privacy and FOI policy will enhance oversight and allow for consistent information policy.</para>
<para class="block">For this purpose, the Bill creates two new independent statutory positions of Australian Information Commissioner and Freedom of Information (FOI) Commissioner. It also makes provision for the appointment of the Privacy Commissioner in this legislation instead of under the Privacy Act 1988. The Government moved an amendment, implementing the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee’s recommendation to refer to the new office holder as the Australian Information Commissioner.</para>
<para class="block">The absence of an independent statutory monitor for FOI was identified as an impediment to effective administration of the FOI Act in the joint 1995 Australian Law Reform Commission and Administrative Review Council Open Government report and later by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. To correct that deficiency, the Australian Information Commissioner and FOI Commissioner will have broad ranging FOI functions. They will ensure a constant voice which not only addresses poor FOI practices, but also addresses attitudes that are not conducive to the presumption of openness which is intended by the Government’s FOI reforms.</para>
<para class="block">The nature of the FOI functions and privacy functions are too extensive for one office holder to effectively manage. Conversely, the appointment of multiple statutory officers of equal standing does not present an effective governance model. The Bill establishes the Australian Information Commissioner as head of the Office for both strategic and administrative purposes. It is intended that the FOI Commissioner will be mainly responsible for the FOI functions, and that the Privacy Commissioner will be mainly responsible for privacy functions.</para>
<para class="block">While the Government expects that the three office holders will work together cooperatively, the Bill makes provision for the Australian Information Commissioner’s view to prevail in any disagreement on matters which involve substantial policy decisions. Provision is also made to ensure that there is no duplication in the performance of essential determination functions.</para>
<para class="block">The FOI functions include those functions that will make the Information and FOI Commissioners strong advocates for FOI, such as promoting awareness, issuing guidance, monitoring compliance and providing training and assistance. It is intended that the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner will be a resource for agencies as well as for the public. The Commissioners will also be given a function of undertaking merits review of access decisions and investigating complaints. The comprehensive nature of the Commissioners’ FOI functions is in keeping with the Government’s intention to provide a central clearing house for FOI matters.</para>
<para class="block">The privacy functions are those functions now performed by the Privacy Commissioner. The Government is currently embarking on reforms to the Privacy Act by preparing draft legislation for release for public consultation later this year. Any changes that are made to the functions and powers of the Privacy Commissioner following the Government’s privacy reforms will of course be aligned with the new structure created in this Bill.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill also gives the Australian Information Commissioner a discrete function of advising the Government on information management policy. That function reflects the capacity for the new structure to generate strategic advice to Government on broader information management policy and practice, including in the use of systems employed in information management. Consistent with the objective of achieving a coordinated approach to information management policy across government, the Australian Information Commissioner is to be assisted by an Information Advisory Committee. The Committee will be chaired by the Australian Information Commissioner and will comprise senior executives from key agencies and other persons outside government who have suitable experience or qualifications.</para>
<para class="block">The establishment of an Office of the Australian Information Commissioner not only supports the important outcome of promoting a pro‑disclosure culture and revitalising FOI, but also lays new, stronger foundations for privacy protection and improvement in the broader management of government information.</para>
<para class="block">In February this year, the Rudd Government showed its commitment to reform in the area of government information by appointing Professor John McMillan AO as the Information Commissioner Designate. As everyone in this chamber is aware, Professor McMillan has extensive experience, including as the Commonwealth Ombudsman for the past seven years and as a campaigner for Australia’s first FOI Act in the 1970s, which makes him an excellent choice for Australia’s first Information Commissioner. After the Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010 is enacted, I will recommend to the Governor-General in Council that she appoint Professor McMillan as the Australian Information Commissioner.</para>

<inline ref="R4164">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The main purpose of the <inline ref="R4164">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010</inline> is to amend the <inline font-style="italic">Freedom of Information Act 1982</inline> (FOI Act) to usher in a new regime for access to government information.</para>
<para class="block">When Labor was in opposition, I was one of the key drafters of Labor’s policy for restoring trust and integrity in government. A core element of this policy was to overhaul Australia’s antiquated FOI laws, which, after over a decade of the Howard Government’s culture of concealment, were in serious need of reform.</para>
<para class="block">When the Rudd Labor Government was elected in 2007, we immediately started work to fulfil our commitment to undertake the most significant overhaul of the FOI Act since its commencement in 1982.  We committed to driving a cultural shift across the bureaucracy to promote a pro-disclosure attitude and we’re fulfilling that commitment.</para>
<para class="block">The Government has already delivered the first stage of FOI reform, introducing and passing legislation to remove the power to issue conclusive certificates in the FOI Act and the Archives Act 1983.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill, together with the Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010, meets the Rudd Government’s remaining FOI election commitments, which are designed to restore trust and integrity in the handling of government information. </para>
<para class="block">The two Bills are the product of a participatory process.  The Government consulted a number of stakeholders and then released exposure drafts of each Bill for public comment in March last year.</para>
<para class="block">The Bills were also referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee for inquiry. Witnesses to the Committee were overwhelmingly in favour of the Bills being immediately passed through Parliament.</para>
<para class="block">In its report on the two Bills, the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee made three recommendations for amendment.  The Government moved amendments to implement two of those recommendations, namely to establish the Information Commissioner as the Australian Information Commissioner and to provide for the Commissioner to be a member of the Administrative Review Council. </para>
<para class="block">The Committee’s recommendation to amend the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill to remove the concept of onus in both review proceedings by the Australian Information Commissioner and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) is not supported by Coalition Senators, nor by some stakeholders who use the FOI Act. </para>
<para class="block">The Government does not accept that the Committee’s recommendation to remove the onus would have disadvantaged applicants. The removal of the onus was recommended to ensure that FOI applications were not treated as adversarial court processes. Notwithstanding this view, the Government has decided to retain the concept of onus in FOI proceedings, making it clear that the Bill is designed to make access to documents easier for applicants, with the agency or Minister under an obligation to justify why non-disclosure is necessary. </para>
<para class="block">Under an existing obligation in the AAT, an agency or Minister is required to use their best endeavours to assist the AAT to make a decision on an FOI review application.  That obligation will also be applied to a review by the Australian Information Commissioner.</para>
<para class="block">Proposals in the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill are also drawn in part from the key findings of the 1995 joint Australian Law Reform Commission and Administrative Review Council Open Government report.  The report’s key findings have been updated and supplemented by other measures to deliver better access to government information.</para>
<para class="block">Given all of these consultation and review processes, the Government considers that the Bills will deliver the intended shift to a culture of disclosure across Government and more effective and efficient access to government information.  They will directly address the culture of secrecy that thrived under the Howard Government.</para>
<para class="block">The Rudd Government remains responsible and accountable to the people it serves.  This Bill amends the objects clause of the FOI Act to expressly refer to the important role that access to government information serves in promoting Australia’s representative democracy. </para>
<para class="block">In pursuit of the FOI Act’s objective to give the Australian community access to government held information, the existing limited publication requirements under Part II of the Act are to be replaced. The Bill provides for a new framework which will require pro-active publication of information by agencies.  This new publication scheme will require agencies to actively consider the types of information they have which can and should be made available to the public. This measure represents a significant shift away from the current system that is predominantly reactive; responding only to requests that have been made. </para>
<para class="block">The publication of information, which will be primarily web-based, needs to be structured, informative and user friendly.  The Australian Information Commissioner, an office which will be created by the Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010, will be responsible for ensuring this occurs. The Australian Information Commissioner will be responsible for issuing guidance to agencies on how they can ensure optimal publication.  Agencies will also be required to develop plans showing what information they will publish to further the objectives of the Act. </para>
<para class="block">The Bill also proposes many changes to improve the effectiveness of the FOI application system.  The changes are closely entwined with the structural reforms proposed by the Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010.  The aim of these measures is to ensure that the public interest in disclosure remains at the forefront of decision making, and that the right of access to documents is not unduly restricted by liberal application of exemption criteria. </para>
<para class="block">A new, single form of public interest test weighted towards disclosure will be introduced and the test will be applied to more exemption categories than is currently the case.  The public interest test is to be added to the economy, research and personal information exemptions and is to be partially applied to the business affairs exemption.  In response to public consultation, the public interest test will not be applied to that part of the business affairs exemption which relates to documents disclosing trade secrets or commercially valuable information.</para>
<para class="block">Decision makers will be required to address the public interest factors taken into account in their reasons for the decision.  The Bill does not seek to exhaustively define public interest factors.  It has long been recognised that the categories of public interest are not closed. The public interest will vary depending on the subject matter. </para>
<para class="block">Certain factors which are not conducive to open and accountable government, including arguments solely concerned with political sensitivity, will not be able to be used as factors supporting non-disclosure of documents.  This extends to submissions ordinarily associated with the deliberative documents exemption, for example, that disclosure would cause a loss of confidence in the government or cause embarrassment to the government.  In keeping with the intention of the reforms to promote disclosure, the Bill lists some pro-disclosure factors but does not list factors against disclosure. </para>
<para class="block">The Bill will repeal exemption categories for Executive Council documents, documents arising out of companies and securities legislation, and documents relating to the conduct by an agency of industrial relations. </para>
<para class="block">The Bill also proposes two limited exclusions from the operation of the FOI Act for certain intelligence related information.  The public interest in maintaining confidence in the information must clearly outweigh the public interest in access to that information.  The nature of intelligence agencies’ functions and some programs which operate to ensure Australia’s strategic defence are such that those intelligence functions would be compromised by public dissemination of that information.  These functions cannot be carried out with the same level of transparency ordinarily expected of administrative action.  This is recognised by the special accountability systems in place for the intelligence agencies through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. </para>
<para class="block">A substantial change which will significantly increase accessibility to information will be reducing the term during which the FOI Act governs public access to government information, and accelerating the application of the Archives Act.  The Bill amends the Archives Act to bring forward the open access period for all records (other than Cabinet notebooks and census information) from 30 years to 20 years.  The open access period for Cabinet notebooks is to be brought forward from 50 years to 30 years.  These measures will make government information available earlier under the Archives Act. </para>
<para class="block">The Bill also amends section 33(1)(b) of the Archives Act to address concerns with the current application of the provision.  Decisions made by the Australian Government on section 33 exemptions will be made consistent with past practice and our international obligations, and will be based on the national interest and based on the views of partner governments.</para>
<para class="block">The Government recognises that the promise of better information disclosure requires structural reforms.  The establishment of an Australian Information Commissioner and FOI Commissioner, as independent officers, will address a long-standing lacuna in effective FOI administration.  In addition to promotional, monitoring and guidance functions, the Commissioners will directly participate in the process by reviewing access decisions made by agencies and Ministers.  Review of a decision by the Australian Information Commissioner will not replace review by the AAT.  A party can still apply for AAT review after an Information Commissioner review if needed.  Both forums will offer full independent merits review, unfettered by the limiting effects of conclusive certificates.  Retaining an option of review by the AAT, an experienced review body, will be particularly important for highly contested FOI matters. </para>
<para class="block">Australian Information Commissioner review will be characterised by reduced formality and adversarial contest, with most applications determined on the papers.  The Commissioners will be able to dispose of an application where an agreement is reached between the parties or by determination if no compromise is reached.</para>
<para class="block">Following public consultation on the exposure draft of the Bill, the Government has amended the Bill to provide that the applicant will have the option of seeking internal review or going directly to the Australian Information Commissioner for review of an initial FOI decision.  By making internal review optional, agencies should be encouraged to make the best possible access decision at first instance.</para>
<para class="block">There is potential for a substantial resource impost in the maintenance of an effective FOI system. That impost in part exists because not all government information can properly be released and so it can take time for agencies to work out what information can be released and what cannot.  The broad range of FOI functions to be vested in the Information and FOI Commissioners are designed to ensure the objects of the Act are achieved with as minimal contest, and therefore cost, as possible.  That includes fostering a pro-disclosure culture among agencies.  To manage access requests that are manifestly unreasonable, the Australian Information Commissioner is given a power to restrict an applicant’s access rights by declaring them to be vexatious.  Provision is also made to enhance consultation provisions for dealing with onerous or vague requests for documents.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Information Commissioner will also take over the bulk of the role of the Ombudsman in investigating complaints about handling of FOI requests.  However, the Ombudsman will still have capacity to investigate complaints which relate to FOI where it would be more appropriate or effective for the Ombudsman to do so. </para>
<para class="block">One aspect of the current law which has restricted the public’s access to information is cost. Cost should not deter reasonable requests for access to information.  The Bill, together with amendments proposed to regulations, remove all application fees, including for internal review. </para>
<para class="block">No costs will apply for access to a person’s own information.  Every applicant will receive some free decision making time. Journalists and not-for-profit organisations will receive the first five hours of decision making time free and all other applicants will receive the first hour of decision making time free.  Some of these measures will be implemented through amendment to regulations.  The regulations will also be amended so that if there is a failure to comply with a statutory time period, any charges will be waived.</para>
<para class="block">Not all these measures received support in the Senate inquiry and some submissions called for wider changes.  The Government will ask the Australian Information Commissioner to undertake a review of the charges system within 12 months of the Commissioner’s appointment.  That review will be comprehensive and will include the effectiveness of measures taken as part of these reforms to reduce the cost of FOI access for applicants.</para>
<para class="block">The Government has allocated $19.5 million over 4 years from 2009-10 for the establishment and running of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (in addition to existing resources for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner).</para>
<para class="block">While the Privacy Act 1988 largely regulates the handling of personal information by Commonwealth agencies, access to and correction of a person’s own information is currently enforced through the FOI Act.  Around 85-90 percent of FOI requests annually are for personal information.  The Government proposes to amend the Privacy Act so that it is the principal legislation which provides for an enforceable right of access to, and correction of, an individual’s own information.  That proposal will be addressed in legislation covering broader reforms to the Privacy Act which I expect to release for public consultation later this year.</para>
<para class="block">The Government believes the legislation now before the Parliament comprises a strong package of measures to enhance access to information for the Australian public. </para>
<para class="block">To ensure the reform package delivers effective change, provision is made in the Bill for the Act to be reviewed two years after the commencement of the reforms.  The review will be comprehensive, and will necessarily cover all aspects of FOI, including how well the two-tier review system is working, how the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner is operating, the exemptions in the Act, and agencies’ implementation of the new information publication scheme.</para>
<para class="block">In order to address the concerns raised by the Australian Greens, the review will also need to include a consideration of whether the exclusion of agencies, including intelligence agencies, from the application of the Act is still appropriate and necessary. Naturally, such a consideration would require reference to international practice and consideration of what is in the Australian public’s interest.</para>
<para class="block">Unlike our predecessors, this Government recognises that transparent and open government is a key component of a healthy and vibrant democracy.  When the Rudd Government was elected, Labor committed to significantly reform Freedom of Information laws and these Bills fulfil the Government’s promise to the Australian public.</para>

<inline ref="R4308">Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This <inline ref="R4308">bill</inline> supports the implementation of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for health professions.</para>
<para class="block">I am very proud to be standing here today introducing this legislation – this Bill is a landmark reform for our health system.</para>
<para class="block">With this Bill, for the first time there will be a national system for the registration and accreditation of 10 health professions– bringing consistency and uniform standards to our health workforce.</para>
<para class="block">Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have already passed the Bills which will put in place the national system. The ACT and Northern Territory have introduced their Bills and South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia are well advanced in their planning.</para>
<para class="block">National registration has been a long time coming – the previous government, with the current Leader of the Opposition as Minister for Health, identified it as a goal, and then decided to sit on his hands. After years of blaming the states and territories for all the problems in the health system, he was unable to work with them to deliver this key health reform.</para>
<para class="block">Just as he sat on the sidelines whilst 60 per cent of Australians suffered from a shortage of doctors, he dithered on this important workforce reform.</para>
<para class="block">The Rudd Government recognised that this goal was one that had stalled and needed pursuing – we immediately got to work with the States and Territories – and in March 2008 signed an intergovernmental agreement to progress the National scheme.</para>
<para class="block">We know that a National scheme could reduce red tape, increase standards and improve safety for the Australian community.</para>
<para class="block">We also know that a national scheme will improve the mobility of the health workforce. It will stop health professionals for having to re-register every time they step across a State border, saving time, money and inconvenience. This for example will help to boost locum support for rural doctors as Doctors become freer to work across State boundaries.</para>
<para class="block">On 3 November 2009, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 (Qld) received Royal Assent in the Queensland Parliament.</para>
<para class="block">The National Law sets out the framework for the scheme, covering registration of health practitioners and accreditation of health education and training, complaints, privacy and information sharing, and transitional arrangements.</para>
<para class="block">The Commonwealth does not need to apply the National Law, however consequential and transitional amendments are required to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to ensure that medical practitioners continue to retain the same Medicare billing eligibility from 1 July 2010.</para>
<para class="block">It also streamlines the extensive systems involved in registration and recognition of medical practitioners for Medicare purposes ensuring reduction of red tape, currency of the Health Insurance Act 1973 regulations and adequate access to Medicare rebates and retention of practitioners in Australia.</para>
<para class="block">Streamlining the recognition of doctors for Medicare purposes</para>
<para class="block">The current pathways to specialist, consultant physician and GP recognition in the Health Insurance Act 1973 necessitate communication exchange between Medicare Australia and relevant organisations (such as medical colleges) to ascertain Medicare eligibility.</para>
<para class="block">These arrangements have been put in place because previously there was variation across states and territories for the recognition of specialist qualifications and general practice qualifications in the registration process.</para>
<para class="block">The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme provides a nationally consistent means of identifying both specialists and GPs, and the mandatory requirement for Continuing Professional Development in the Scheme means Medicare Australia is no longer is required to monitor whether practitioners providing a ‘Medicare rebateable service’ are meeting Continuing Professional Development requirements.</para>
<para class="block">It is essential that the extensive systems involved in registration and recognition of doctors for Medicare purposes are streamlined to ensure reduction of red tape, currency of the Health Insurance regulations and efficient access to Medicare rebates.</para>
<para class="block">The Health Insurance Act 1973 provides various pathways for recognising specialists, consultant physicians and general practitioners (GPs) for Medicare purposes.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill provides an opportunity to streamline current specialist recognition processes under Commonwealth legislation.</para>
<para class="block">This includes removing the current Vocational Register of General Practitioners, particularly now that the Medical Board of Australia has recommended that Health Ministers endorse ‘general practice’ as a specialty for the medical profession.</para>
<para class="block">I am aware that the Medical Board of Australia is soon to make decisions about the eligibility requirements for the General Practitioner specialty register.</para>
<para class="block">I can assure the House that this bill will not disadvantage medical practitioners that are currently registered in states and territories.</para>
<para class="block">In particular, it will not disadvantage any GPs that are currently on the Vocational Register whether or not they have a fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners or the Australian College of Remote and Rural Medicine.</para>
<para class="block">Streamlining specialist recognition will also facilitate workforce mobility and access to Medicare for International Medical Graduates.</para>
<para class="block">Conclusion</para>
<para class="block">The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for health professions will modernise the regulation of health professionals by creating a single regulatory environment.</para>
<para class="block">By ending the duplication of effort, multiple standards and red tape caused by separate systems in each state and territory, we will have a more workable registration scheme for Australian patients and practitioners that also contributes to improving the safety of our health system for all Australians.</para>
<para class="block">It provides the community with the reassurance that health professionals across Australia meet a common set of standards. Our health workforce will also benefit from the improved mobility the national scheme will offer.</para>
<para class="block">I would like to extend my thanks to all of the professional groups who have constructively engaged in an incredibly complex task over four years – this includes the current State and Territory Health Professional Boards who have faced enormous change.</para>
<para class="block">I would also like to recognise the expertise and hard work of the officials who have undertaken the work that is making National Registration a reality.</para>
<para class="block">Lastly I acknowledge my Ministerial colleagues around the country who are all committed to a National scheme for the registration of health professionals- and put the national interest first.</para>
<para class="block">I look forward to the National Law being adopted in the remaining jurisdictions over the coming months and the implementation of a National registration and accreditation scheme for the first time in Australia.</para>

<inline ref="R4316">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010</inline>
</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R4316">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010</inline> contains three amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff Act 1995</inline> (the Customs Tariff).</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Two of these amendments relate to import concessions for the textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry. The amendments will insert end-dates for items 61 and 73 in Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff. These amendments reflect the Government’s change of policy from providing assistance through tariff concessions to providing a wider range of support to TCF industries as set out in the Government’s TCF Innovation Package as announced in the 2009-10 Budget.</para>
<para class="block">The Government’s TCF Innovation Package will drive innovation and renewal in the Australian TCF industries by investing $401.0 million in a retargeted TCF Package from 2009-10 to 2015-16. The new TCF Innovation Package redirects $55.0 million towards innovation, including $10.0 million in new funding. The Package recognises the importance of the TCF industries, which employ over 45,000 Australians and underpin regional economies around the country. It aims to make the TCF sector stronger and more sustainable by supporting the development of new products and processes, especially at the high-tech, high-value end of the market.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill amends item 61 to insert an end-date of 30 June 2010. Item 61 provides the means for duty concessions under the Expanded Overseas Assembly Provisions Scheme.</para>
<para class="block">This Scheme provides duty concessions for certain TCF goods that are manufactured overseas from Australian fabric and are subsequently imported back to Australia.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill amends the end-date of item 73, changing the existing end-date from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2011. Item 73 gives effect to the Product Diversification Scheme (PDS) for certain clothing and finished textiles.</para>
<para class="block">This Scheme allows a producer to earn duty credits for certain clothing and finished textiles and then to apply those credits, through item 73, to offset duty payable on qualifying imported finished products.</para>
<para class="block">While importers will no longer be able to earn duty credits under the PDS after 30 June 2010, the end-date of 30 June 2011 for item 73 will provide importers with an additional twelve months to use those credits.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill also inserts an end-date of 31 December 2009 for item 53C in Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff. Item 53C provided a mechanism to reduce the general rate of customs duty from 10% to 5% for certain goods that were not of a kind used as components in passenger motor vehicles.</para>
<para class="block">From 1 January 2010, the general rate of duty for the above goods reduced from 10% to 5%. As a consequence, there is no need for the item 53C concession and the item is redundant.</para>

<inline ref="R4292">Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The <inline ref="R4292">Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010</inline> will improve patient choice of pathology services, and encourage providers to compete on price and quality of service.</para>
<para class="block">Currently the <inline font-style="italic">Health Insurance Act 1973</inline> requires that, in most cases, in order for a Medicare benefit to be payable for a pathology service rendered by or on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner, a request for the service must be made to that particular pathology practitioner or the approved pathology authority at which they work. This means that a patient is effectively required to take a completed request form to the approved pathology practitioner or authority named on the form. This restriction does not apply to other diagnostic services that attract Medicare benefits.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill removes this restriction so that, while there will still be a legislative requirement for a request for a pathology service to be made, there will no longer be a requirement that the request be made to a particular approved pathology practitioner or authority. This legislative change will allow patients to take a pathology request to an approved pathology practitioner or authority of their choice and will encourage pathology providers to compete on price and convenience for patients.</para>
<para class="block">The Government supports a patient’s right to choose their pathology provider, just as they are entitled to choose their own GP or any other medical practitioner.</para>
<para class="block">Medical practitioners who request pathology services will still be free to make recommendations to patients about which pathology provider they feel is best suited to their needs. Feedback from requesters has shown that there are often valid clinical reasons for recommending a particular pathology provider over another. The Government recognizes the importance of the doctor patient relationship and will continue to encourage medical practitioners to discuss with patients options for all aspects of their treatment, including pathology services.</para>
<para class="block">Convenience and access to bulk billing are some of the reasons that a patient may wish to choose one provider over another. However, patients will also need to be aware of the potential consequences of not keeping their requesting practitioner informed of their choice, as this may impact on the continuity of their care.</para>
<para class="block">In the case of diagnostic imaging requests, patients already have the option of taking their request form to any provider, not just the one named on the request form. These changes to the <inline font-style="italic">Health Insurance Act</inline> merely bring the arrangements for pathology requests in line with those for other diagnostic services.</para>
<para class="block">The amendments will take effect from 1 July 2010.</para>
<para class="block">The Government will also make changes to relevant regulations prior to 1 July 2011 to require that requests for pathology services include a clear and understandable statement, which is obviously positioned, making patients aware that requests can be taken to any approved pathology practitioner or authority.</para>
<para class="block">Pathology providers will be able to continue to produce ‘branded’ request forms (that include the company logo and address) and to provide these to requesting medical practitioners. These may include a list of the locations of that provider’s collection centres. They will, however, be required from 1 July 2011 to include on their request forms a clear and understandable statement, which is obviously positioned, making patients aware that these forms can be taken to any approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority.</para>
<para class="block">Options for the wording of this statement is one of a range of implementation issues being discussed with requesters, providers and consumers of pathology services as part of the stakeholder consultation process currently being conducted by my Department.</para>
<para class="block">Informed patient choice is a key element of quality health care. This amendment will ensure that patients have a right to choose their pathology provider and are made aware of that fact, leading to increased competition and better service among providers.</para>

<inline ref="R4317">Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The <inline ref="R4317">Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010</inline> amends the <inline font-style="italic">Aviation Transport Security Act 2004</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003</inline>.</para>
<para class="block">Background</para>
<para class="block">Australia’s aviation security legislation framework consists of a number of layers of security measures, and is under constant review to ensure that Australia’s aviation industry is safeguarded and able to quickly adapt to new threats to security.</para>
<para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Aviation Transport Security Act 2004</inline> establishes a preventive security regime to safeguard against acts of terrorism and unlawful interference with the Australian aviation sector.</para>
<para class="block">The failed terrorist attempt on Christmas Day last year against a United States-bound flight clearly demonstrates the continuing need for stringent preventive security measures.</para>
<para class="block">Australia’s maritime industry is critical to the social and economic prosperity of Australia. Nearly 4000 ships carry goods and commodities to and from Australian shores each year, carrying 99 percent of Australia’s imports and exports by volume. These ships represent nearly 10 percent of world seaborne trade by mass – the 5<inline font-variant="superscript">th</inline> largest shipping task in the world.</para>
<para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003</inline> establishes a preventive security regime to safeguard against acts of terrorism and unlawful interference with Australia’s ports, port facilities, ships and offshore facilities.</para>
<para class="block">It gives effect to Australia’s international obligations as a Contracting Administration under the International Maritime Organisation’s International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, established under Chapter 11-2 of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention.</para>
<para class="block">To quote from the recently released Counter-Terrorism White Paper “terrorism continues to pose a serious security challenge to Australia ... the threat of terrorism is real and enduring. It has become a persistent and permanent feature of Australia’s security environment”.</para>
<para class="block">Objective of the Bill</para>
<para class="block">The Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 contains two amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Aviation Transport Security Act 2004</inline>. Both amendments have been developed to better equip the Australian Government’s capacity to respond in the event of an aviation incident.</para>
<para class="block">The bill also amends the <inline font-style="italic" font-size="12pt">Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003</inline> to implement a range of proposals which emerged from a recent examination of security arrangements for passenger ships undertaken by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government.</para>
<para class="block">Together, the measures in this Bill ensure Australia’s preventive transport security arrangements continue to deliver effective security outcomes, both now and into the future.</para>
<para class="block">Measures in the Bill</para>
<para class="block">I will first provide an overview of the measures in the Bill to amend the <inline font-style="italic">Aviation Transport Security Act 2004</inline>.</para>
<para class="block">The first amendment will allow the prohibited items list to be made in a notice issued by the Minister responsible for administering the Act. Currently, the prohibited items list is made in the regulations, and as such, any amendment to be made to the prohibited items list currently involves a relatively lengthy legislative process. This amendment will ensure that the prohibited items list can be more easily amended and updated to reflect emerging threats and vulnerabilities to aviation security, while still preserving Parliamentary scrutiny.</para>
<para class="block">The second aviation security amendment will enable the Secretary of my department to delegate all or any of his powers and functions to a Senior Executive Service employee in the Attorney-General’s Department. While this amendment is administrative in nature, it is being made in preparation for the establishment of the ‘Commonwealth Incident Coordinator’ position within Attorney General’s Department from 1 July 2010. The creation of the position of the Commonwealth Incident Coordinator forms part of the Australian Government’s all-hazards approach to crisis and consequence management.</para>
<para class="block">The role of the Commonwealth ‘Incident Coordinator’ is to coordinate response planning and the implementation of Australian Government crisis management decisions across relevant domains. By delegating these powers to the Commonwealth Incident Coordinator, the Australian Government will be better placed to respond in a fully coordinated fashion to rapidly developing security incidents.</para>
<para class="block">For example, as part of a coordinated response to a terrorist incident, the Commonwealth Incident Coordinator could use the powers to direct an aircraft subject to a bomb threat to land at a particular airport, or park in a specific part of an airport, where emergency services are best placed to respond to the threat.</para>
<para class="block">I will now describe the measures in the bill which amend the <inline font-style="italic">Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003</inline>.</para>
<para class="block">Firstly, the bill inserts provisions to allow ship operators to be given exemptions from certain security requirements in certain circumstances, where there is no impact on the security outcome.</para>
<para class="block">From time to time, Australian ships that are not required to be security regulated under the Act need to travel overseas or to another Australian state or territory on an exceptional basis. These ‘one-off’ voyages every five years or so are typically for maintenance purposes, but mean that these ships must comply with all of the security obligations under the Act, at a significant additional cost to their operations.</para>
<para class="block">The amendment proposed in the Bill would allow operators of Australian ships to apply to the Secretary for an exemption from the requirement to hold an International Ship Security Certificate or a Ship Security Plan. Such an exemption would only be granted in exceptional circumstances, and if security in the maritime environment was not reduced. This amendment is consistent with that provided for in the Safety of Life at Sea, or SOLAS, Convention, to which Australia is a signatory.</para>
<para class="block">A similar situation exists for foreign flagged ships; they are occasionally granted an exemption by their flag State from complying with their requirement to hold an International Ship Security Certificate (or its equivalent). Such an exemption is often granted to allow the ship to travel to Australia as part of one-off overseas voyage to conduct maintenance on the ship, a similar situation to the one I just explained.</para>
<para class="block">There is currently no ability under the Act to recognise an exemption made by another Contracting Administration to the SOLAS Convention, meaning that a foreign ship arriving in Australia without an International Ship Security Certificate is in contravention of the Act. The proposed amendment would allow for regulations to be made prescribing certain kinds of regulated ships that are exempt from the requirement to have or obtain a valid ship security certificate on arrival in Australia.</para>
<para class="block">Secondly, the bill makes amendments with regard to passenger ships to enable regulations to be made to define different classes of passenger ships and to enable screening officers to conduct frisk searches of passengers and crew.</para>
<para class="block">Currently a ‘one size fits all’ approach is applied to passenger ship security regardless of the operational characteristics of the specific ship or class of ship. This approach does not allow individual factors, constraints and considerations to be taken into account when prescribing an appropriate and customised range of preventive security measures in relation to the level of threat for their operating environments.</para>
<para class="block">This amendment would allow for the prescription of different classes of security regulated ships in the maritime security Regulations. For example, this would allow passenger ships to be defined by, say, any combination of size, passenger capacity, areas of geographical operation, type of items carried or the types of activities they conduct. It would allow for customised security measures to be developed and applied to each class, avoiding the issues attached to over or under-regulation.</para>
<para class="block">Passenger ship security will also be strengthened through the introduction of frisk search powers to enhance the screening and clearance of passengers and crew in certain circumstances. The establishment of frisk search powers for the passenger ship sector means that more effective security screening processes can be promptly introduced, should the nature and level of threat in the maritime environment suddenly escalate. The recent events of Christmas Day highlight the need to have a responsive security framework, adaptable to rapid changes in circumstances. The power to conduct frisk searches in certain circumstances already exists for aviation travellers and the proposed amendment would mirror these arrangements.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill will also provide greater flexibility to make regulations with regard to screening and clearing matters.</para>
<para class="block">I propose to amend the Act so that regulations can be made to address all necessary aspects of maritime security screening practices, and not be limited to the matters specified in that section.</para>
<para class="block">Thirdly, the bill enables certain persons to be appointed as ‘security assessment inspectors’ to conduct security assessments of maritime industry participants.</para>
<para class="block">Currently the Act does not have any explicit powers of entry into security regulated areas other than for Departmental offices and law enforcement officers.</para>
<para class="block">This amendment will enable the Secretary to appoint a person as a security assessment inspector if that person meets criteria to be specified in regulations. Appointed security assessment inspectors will be able to survey the extant security environment at a regulated maritime site and examine the effectiveness of current security policies; this will enable timely responses to changing and emerging threats to be developed to ensure the regime continues to meet the threat of terrorism both now and into the future.</para>
<para class="block">Fourthly, the bill provides for measure to allow the Secretary of my Department to delegate his powers under the MTOFSA to Agency Heads and certain SES officers in other agencies in certain circumstances.</para>
<para class="block">Currently, the Secretary of my Department may delegate all or any of their powers and functions under the Act to an SES employee in my Department only. This amendment would allow the Secretary to delegate all or any of their powers and functions to the Agency Head of an agency that conducts national security activities and an SES employee in the Attorney Generals Department. In respect of delegations to Agency Heads, these may be sub-delegated within the agency to an SES Band three employee.</para>
<para class="block">This amendment would also allow the Secretary to delegate his or her powers and functions to the Commonwealth Incident Coordinator, to be created in the Attorney-General’s Department at the SES level and mirrors the aviation security amendment I mentioned earlier.</para>
<para class="block">The ability to delegate powers externally across the aviation, maritime and offshore environments provides my Department with the maximum flexibility within the legislative framework to enable an appropriate incident response to be made in unexpected and often urgent situations.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, the Bill makes some minor amendments to modernise image recording powers for maritime security inspectors. To modernise the options for use of recording media and to align with the newly introduced powers of a Security Assessment Inspector, the Bill replaces the power to photograph equipment with the power to make a still or moving image, or any recording of equipment. To correct a drafting anomaly, the Bill introduces is a similar power to allow for the recording of images by maritime security inspectors when inspecting equipment at a place, or a vehicle or vessel under control of a regulated maritime industry participant, to align with their existing power to photograph on board a security regulated ship and on a security regulated offshore facility.</para>
<para class="block">Conclusion</para>
<para class="block">Just as terrorists will continue to alter their methods, so too must we ensure that our preventive transport security arrangements evolve to meet this threat. The Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 will enhance the operation of the aviation and maritime security regimes for the benefit of our maritime, offshore and aviation industries and the Australian public. I am confident that the measures introduced in this Bill will contribute to a transport system that is more secure against the threat of terrorism.</para>

<para class="block">In relation to this particular Senate inquiry I congratulate Senator Scullion, all of the members of the committee and the secretariat staff for the very significant work they have done on this report. I know Senator Scullion is very keen to speak to the report and its recommendations and will certainly take the opportunity to do so later on. There are a number of very significant recommendations, all of which seek to improve the situation of Australia’s Indigenous people.</para>
<para>I had the privilege of being able to attend some of the committee’s hearings—in particular, the hearing held at Weipa in the Cape York Peninsula area of Queensland. The evidence given made it quite clear that, in spite of motions to say sorry to Indigenous people by Mr Rudd earlier in the term of this parliament, as with most things with Mr Rudd, they were just words. It is again a hallmark of this government that there is plenty of talk but very little action. Indigenous people who gave evidence to this inquiry clearly made that point.</para>
<para>Another case in point is the wild rivers legislation in Queensland which imposes a huge impost on the ability of Indigenous people to usefully use their lands. It is legislation that has been widely condemned by Indigenous people in North Queensland. Mr Abbott has moved a quite significant private members bill to overturn Queensland legislation to avoid the provisions of the Queensland wild rivers legislation and to make sure that any decisions made by the Queensland government in relation to this matter are only taken with the full consultation and consent of Indigenous people.</para>
<para>Mr Rudd had an opportunity to indicate to Australia and to Indigenous people that his words of saying sorry meant more than just words. This was an instance where Mr Rudd could have turned those words into action. Regrettably, so far he and his colleagues in the Labor Party have opposed this private members bill, and I think that is indicative of the approach that the Rudd government has taken towards Indigenous people generally.</para>
<para>As I indicated, there are a number of significant recommendations made by the committee. I commend those to the parliament. Senator Scullion as chair will be addressing this report at a later period. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>—I too would like to comment on this report. I am a member of this committee and I think committee members get a very good insight into some of the issues that Aboriginal communities need to deal with. We travel around each of the states and territories as much as we can. We visited a number of communities, as Senator Macdonald has indicated. Unfortunately, I was not able to make it to Weipa—which I was most distressed about—due to other committee commitments. However, I did join the committee for the rest of the hearings in Queensland and I learnt some very valuable information.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Several of the recommendations you will see in this committee report address the issues of the Cape York Family Responsibility Commission. There is a review of that process and an ongoing evaluation, which I think is very important. You will see that several of the recommendations relate to ensuring that results from that evaluation of the Cape York trial are very seriously reviewed. I think that is particularly important. We heard from the Cape York Family Responsibility Commission, who gave us some very valuable information. I was also in the position of having heard representatives of the commission talk at an ACOSS conference the week before in Canberra, so I have had the opportunity to hear about this trial on several occasions.</para>
<para>A very important point to make here is that this trial is significantly different from many of the other trials that are going on around Australia about income management. A lot of people hold up the Cape York income management trial as an indication of the success of income management. The point that is very clear from the inquiry and from talking to representatives of the family commission is that they take a very holistic approach to the way they deal with the issues of disadvantage in Cape York—the issue of not attending school and the other issues that affect family dysfunction. That is, they put a lot of effort into case management. This trial has cost around $40 million. There are many people pointing to the success of the trial. About 450 people have been through the process. Only 98 of those have been income managed and towards the end of the process. What happens is that you get case managers and case workers working with the families to look at what is going on in those families—how they can help, whether it is the kids’ nonattendance at school, how you encourage attendance at school, whether there is domestic violence and the other causes of disadvantage—and start to address those and walk people through the process.</para>
<para>The point is that, of those 400, only 98 at the time we heard the evidence had been income managed. That was a much more consultative process. As you can see, $40 million into a trial of that size is a substantial amount of money. I am not for one minute criticising that. The point is that there is a lot of effort going into case management to help people to genuinely change. I very strongly support the recommendation the committee has made about looking at the results. The key is that we need to look at the success factors, if overall it is judged to be successful.</para>
<para>We raised a number of issues in the report about housing. There was a lot of ongoing criticism about the SIHIP process and a motion was passed in this place this morning dealing with that. We raised a lot of questions about that program. You can be sure that there will be a lot more focus on that issue, I would suggest in this place anyway, in estimates and in the committee’s ongoing work. That is an absolute key, as we all know, to addressing disadvantage in Aboriginal communities.</para>
<para>The other issue that we covered, particularly in Queensland—we had a particular focus on Queensland this time; senators may remember that we had a focus on Western Australia and the Northern Territory last time—was criminal justice issues. We had a very useful discussion on that issue with correctional services and the Attorney-General’s Department in Queensland. Aboriginal incarceration is a very significant issue that certainly I and the committee have been looking at very carefully. I believe there will be further work done by the committee on the issues surrounding incarceration. A discussion paper has been produced by the committee on that very clear issue, which we need to focus on very strongly. I am very hopeful that the committee can continue to look at that, in the same way that I am hopeful that other agencies will start to look at the very high number of Aboriginal people who are incarcerated in the criminal justice system and its causes.</para>
<para>One of the issues that came up in this inquiry—and the matter is dealt with in the report that I am going to table next in this place—is that of Aboriginal people in the criminal justice system who have poor hearing. In Queensland, it was acknowledged that Aboriginal people are not screened for hearing problems as they go into the criminal justice system. One of the recommendations in the report is for the Queensland government to have a look at that issue and consider screening Aboriginal people for hearing impairment as they go into the criminal justice system. I very strongly commend to the chamber that recommendation as well because I think it will start to address some very important hearing and health issues for Aboriginal Australians. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">It is with great pleasure that I present this report to the chamber. This has been a very important inquiry. We have learnt a lot, as anybody reading the committee’s report and looking at the submissions will note. We have travelled extensively around Australia to various states. We have heard from individuals, from organisations working with those with a hearing impairment and taken a lot of evidence. We have made a large number of recommendations because it is a vital issue and one that touches in some way every Australian. Currently, one in six Australians has a hearing impairment and that is predicted to rise to one in four Australians. Of course, it is not just those with a hearing impairment who are affected; it is their families and friends and the productivity of Australia. Hearing impairment costs us billions of dollars. As I said, it touches families, friends and employers, so it affects everybody. There are some key issues. I should say straightaway that there is a very strong acknowledgment of the programs that we already have in Australia, particularly by Australian Hearing Services and the fantastic work they do with those between birth and the age of 21. And there are other services for the over-65s who are very strongly supported.</para>
<para>Access to services for those between the ages of 21 and 65 was the biggest issue that was raised with us. Until the age of 21 people get very strong support and they get access to hearing aids and assessments. But, when they get to 21, that is it—there is no more support. Take for example students at university who are doing their courses and their hearing aids no longer work. Hearing aids can cost between $3,000 and $10,000. If you are a university student, you cannot find $3,000 to $10,000. We heard of personal accounts where people said that they had to drop out of university because they were not able to hear. So it has affected their education—and, of course, then it affects their ability to be employed. We also heard a lot of evidence of people retiring early because they felt excluded from the workforce. They were no longer able to cope in the workforce with a hearing impairment.</para>
<para>We have made a number of recommendations that deal with access to services. We have said that we believe that those over 21, for a start, should still be able to gain access to Hearing Services Australia on a means tested basis. Obviously if you are in a position where you can afford those services, it would be on a fee-for-service basis. But, if you cannot, we believe it should be means tested. We also believe that people should have access to services on a means tested basis—so the same sort of process that applies for access to the voucher system et cetera. Those over 21 should have access to these services on a means tested approach. There is no doubt in our minds that those between the ages of 21 and 65 are disadvantaged by not being able to get access to hearing services.</para>
<para>We have also made a number of recommendations around education, awareness and research. We need to, for a start, increase awareness of hearing impairment in Australia. We need to increase the awareness of employers. We need to increase access for people to gain support in the workforce. I know a lot of members will be aware that I am very strongly supportive of the need to address hearing in Aboriginal communities. Hearing in Aboriginal communities is a very significant issue. We spent a lot of time looking at the research in this area. In some communities, up to 40 per cent of people are affected by otitis media, which then affects their hearing. A four per cent level of this disease internationally is considered a pandemic and a serious health risk. In some communities, as I said, 40 per cent of people are affected by otitis media. Particularly if they are babies, they have reoccurring bouts of this and, by the time they get to school, their hearing has been significantly affected. That then alienates them from school. If you are going to school and English is not your first language and your hearing is impaired, you are in big trouble from the word go in terms of being able to access literacy and numeracy programs. That can increasingly alienate you from education.</para>
<para>We looked at the number of Aboriginal people with a hearing impairment who are in correctional institutions and the criminal justice system. We were presented with evidence from the Northern Territory, where there was a study done in, I think, 2007—but it might have been a bit earlier. That study showed that 90 per cent of Aboriginal people in the Darwin correctional centre had a hearing impairment—90 per cent. Other states actually do not know what number of Aboriginal people in the criminal justice system have a hearing impairment. New South Wales said that it had done a study that indicated it was very high there too. So we have made a number of recommendations looking at access to hearing services and dealing with this issue in Aboriginal communities. It is absolutely fundamental.</para>
<para>One of the key points that was raised with us was that Hearing Services Australia can provide hearing aids to people up to the age of 21 and they can provide hearing aids to Aboriginal children but, unfortunately, hearings aids for Aboriginal children, particularly if you are in a remote community, get lost, get damaged and get grit in them because they are in sand and sometimes there is a bit of shame about wearing them. But what has been identified as extremely successful for Aboriginal children is sound fields and dealing with acoustics in the classroom. Unfortunately, under the legislation, Hearing Services Australia cannot provide those services. Even though it is cheaper and more effective to provide sound fields in classrooms, they are unable to fund that because of the legislation. So we have made recommendations that that be reviewed and that those services be provided to schools.</para>
<para>We found that there was no overall audit of the number of classrooms in the Northern Territory that have sound fields. I suppose one of the immediate results of this inquiry was that, coincidentally, on the day the inquiry was in Darwin and I was asking questions around sound fields, the education department announced that it was going to be undertaking an audit of the number of classrooms in the Northern Territory. I would say that that was an immediately good outcome from our inquiry.</para>
<para>We have made a large number of recommendations. We tried to trim them, but this issue is so important to this country, particularly when you consider the ageing population and that we are going to go from one in six to one in four Australians who have a hearing impairment. This affects people’s physical and mental health, their ability to participate in community, their employability and, basically, their life outcomes. It is absolutely essential that we build on the good work that we do in Australia. This report is not about what a bad job we do in Australia on hearing services and helping the hearing impaired; it is about building on the good work that we do. We cannot rest on our laurels.</para>
<para>We need to inject more resources into some key areas—in particular, into helping those people between the ages of 21 and 65. We need to enable them to access services. We need to train people. One of the recommendations is about ensuring people can get trained in audiology. There are also some perverse incentives in the system at the moment. Those over 65 can automatically get access to the voucher system. The government has introduced some measures around eligibility. But a lot of people feel that those over 65 who—after being told by, for example, their families that they think they have some hearing issues—go and get tested and get hearing aids then put those hearing aids in the drawer. At least a quarter of those end up getting put in the drawer. Those people are not getting the assistance that their hearing aids could provide them. So we need to provide more support to older people about accessing hearing services.</para>
<para>I know some of my colleagues want to talk about this. This was a unanimous report. I urge people to read it and I particularly urge government to take on board our recommendations. I thank the secretariat for all their support—they have been fantastic—and I thank my colleagues and all those marvellous organisations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Four years ago, Mr Peter Lindley and his wife Jill came to visit me in my office to talk about the urgent need to have an inquiry into hearing in our country. He had a severe hearing impairment himself, having had industrial hearing loss over many years. He came to talk about why it is so important for us as a government to look into the issue of hearing loss across our community, focusing on the need for access, support and, most importantly, looking at what the dangers are to the hearing health of our country into the future.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It has taken a long time but now we have been able to have a formal hearing into hearing—which we laughed about on the committee many times as we actually put those terms together. Nonetheless, we have now come forward with a report which has a large number of recommendations. It strongly vindicates the urgent need that there was for this issue to be considered by our government.</para>
<para>As Senator Siewert has said, there were no complaints about the quality of service for those who are able to access the service in our country, and there were significant amounts of praise given both for the people who worked in the Australian hearing services and for the amazing wealth of intellectual and professional knowledge we have in the areas of research in this country. Again, as so often happens, when you actually have the time to see what is available in this country it gives us great pride. Internationally, the work of the researchers and the work of the people in this industry are renowned across the whole world—and should be, most particularly by the people who live in this country.</para>
<para>We will not have time, in the very short time we have got to speak this morning, to talk about the range of important things that came out of this inquiry. I do want to put on record, though, some of the evidence that we received about the mental health aspects of people who have hearing issues in our country—such as the feeling of isolation, the feeling of not being engaged in the community and the way that people can have enormous problems in fitting in and being accepted. Those things were told to us with great difficulty by many people who chose to come and talk with us about their private pain. It was not only from those who actually had hearing loss but also from their parents, their friends and the community around them.</para>
<para>When we see that people have been damaged by the fact that they do not feel accepted by those around them, when their opportunities for employment and education and their opportunities to make effective choices about their future are all affected by something that so many of us take for granted—the ability to hear and communicate effectively with those around us—we as a wider Australian community must accept these issues. We must look at a way we can address them and then we can effectively say that we are working well with all those in our community.</para>
<para>As we talk further over many years, I believe some of these recommendations will be before us as we make decisions about how we best respond. There is the whole aspect of improving access to services. Most particularly, we heard from those people who were over 21 who had been receiving amazingly strong support—the best in the world. We were told on a number of occasions that the support that young people in this country have up to the age of 21 is unparalleled anywhere in the world; but the way that the system works now, and has for many years—this is not a new issue—is one that needs to be firmly on the agenda into the future. The access to services for people over 21 needs to be something that we consider; it cannot be just a personal responsibility. The costs are enormous. It was a huge surprise to me to see the large costs of getting hearing services and that is something no family can handle by themselves.</para>
<para>I could go on for a long time about the issues in schools and education, but I do know that Senator Adams wants to make a contribution in this area. I want to put on record my appreciation to the secretariat and my appreciation for so many people who gave their time to tell us their stories—again reinforcing the value of the committee system in this place. We now have those issues in front of us. We cannot run away from them. I had practised my Auslan to say, ‘Thank you, we hear you in this place’. I do not think it would actually work effectively in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> but I can assure you that many of us now have a greater appreciation of the need to widen our language services. Mr Lindley, we finally came through.</para>

<para>—I also rise to speak on our Senate Community Affairs References Committee report, <inline font-style="italic">Hear us: inquiry into hearing health in Australia</inline>. When we started this inquiry I wondered how it was going to turn out, but it was absolutely incredible how the public embraced it. I would like to thank all those who contributed to our inquiry. We had an enormous number of submissions and the further we went the more we learnt as a committee.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would like to focus on the issue of Indigenous people. Otitis media is a very common problem amongst Indigenous communities. It just goes to show, with the evidence that we heard later on, that 90 per cent of all incarcerated Indigenous people have some sort of hearing loss. Think about this: a child with otitis media that has not been able to be rectified has to somehow be educated. But because the child cannot hear and cannot communicate with its parents or peers, it moves through society being a little different and probably rejected in the community. I think that through the inquiry we have come up with something that really and truly must be worked on very hard.</para>
<para>As those children grow up, if they are rejected, they become loners. They are not educated because they cannot hear, and they become frustrated. They, unfortunately, often end up in the justice system. It is much easier for them when they do not understand to nod and say yes. I do wonder just how many of them end up with the wrong sentencing and move backwards and forwards through the justice system. That to me is one of the most important issues that we have to deal with. Somehow we have to ensure that those children, when they are babies, can be treated properly and then they can be educated.</para>
<para>We found a great example at Hermannsburg. There are a large number of children at the school with some type of hearing loss. The school there is very proactive with children with hearing loss. They have acoustic classrooms with hearing loops. The teachers use lapel microphones. Those children are really doing very, very well. Several months ago there was a photo of the principal of the school with a number of students on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> to show what can be done in a remote Indigenous community as far as education goes. A lot of that was to do with the fact that those children had the ability to hear what the teachers were saying and so the teachers were able to communicate with the children.</para>
<para>Once again, the solutions lie in being tested as a baby to pick up any problems associated with hearing and sorting out any behavioural problems which may develop and mentoring these children through their education. I know that time is limited, so I would like to thank the secretariat. They have been very good in travelling with us, coping with all the issues we had to cope with and with the large number of submissions that we had. I would like to commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

</talker>
<para>—This report is one which has been produced cooperatively on a multipartisan basis—if I can put it that way. It was the subject of a reference that I moved and that was co-sponsored by Senators Milne and Colbeck. The inquiry was initiated by serious problems in the state of Tasmania in relation to negotiations between dairy farmers and milk processors but has proceeded way beyond the remit of that particular problem, although that problem has been given serious consideration in the report.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The report points out that the dairy industry was the subject of deregulation and that up until the year 2000 there was much regulation around the country in the dairy industry. At that time a process of deregulation took place and it was examined then by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, a committee of which I was a member at that time. The report of that committee is one in which I participated on a very active basis. This report refers to the circumstances that existed at that time and in the lead-up to that time and talks about one of the findings of that report. This report of the Senate Economics References committee says in paragraph 2.18:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In their findings however, they also noted that of serious concern was the suggestion that the controlled regulation provided would ‘shift to processors and large retailers who would then be able to dictate terms to the industry and marketplace.’</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This report essentially has found that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee’s finding at that time has proven to be correct and that power in the industry has indeed moved substantially into the hands of processors and large retailers. In relation to the balance of power between those entities, large retailers held by far the most power.</para>
<para>There are 15 recommendations made in this report. They refer to the state of trade practices law in this country and matters which pertain to the negotiation between dairy farmers and processors and other entities. They refer to the state of affairs which relates to the regulation of acquisitions and takeovers, particularly as they relate to the dairy industry. There are references in the report to members of this committee who are concerned with that issue as it pertains to other industries as well. In other words, the findings in this report are compounding the views of members of the committee in relation to other issues.</para>
<para>This report is one which has very broad support. It is, if I can perhaps put it this way, one which is made beyond politics and made on the evidence before it. It is one of the reports which typically used to come from the rural and regional affairs committee—but it has now come from this committee—where members of the committee make a finding based not on politics but purely on the evidence before them. We would encourage the government and the public to have regard for the report on that basis.</para>
<para>There is limited time today to present a full debate about this matter, and the government is very keen for other legislation before the chamber this morning to proceed. We hope that we have the cooperation of all parties in that regard. I want to thank the secretary, John Hawkins, and a member of the secretariat, Sandra Kennedy, for their very hard work in the production of this report and the work of the committee. It certainly has been greatly enhanced by the work and the drafting that they have done for us. I think many members of the committee would share the view that this report would not read as well and probably would not be as soundly presented without the assistance of members of the secretariat.</para>
<para>I thank members of this committee who have participated in this inquiry for their cooperation. We hope that this report illuminates the affairs in this industry and will have some impact on policy of any government in the future in this regard.</para>

<para>—In speaking to this report of the Senate Economics References Committee, <inline font-style="italic">Milking it for all it’s worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry</inline>, I also acknowledge the work of my colleagues who sat on the committee, particularly Senators O’Brien and Milne, who co-sponsored the motion on this particular report, and Senator Eggleston, who chaired the inquiry and travelled around the country with us. I would also like to share with Senator O’Brien in thanking the secretariat, particularly John Hawkins and Sandra Kennedy, for their work. It was quite intense at times. There was quite a deal of negotiation to get a consensus report, which is one thing that we all thought was important in dealing with this issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As Senator O’Brien has indicated, I think it perhaps has broader implications. We did look very closely at the dairy industry because of circumstances that occurred in that sector at the time, but the recommendations have a much broader remit when you consider their potential applications through the Trade Practices Act, the recommendation to review the National Competition Policy and also some of the other issues, particularly relating to the dairy industry.</para>
<para>Like Senator O’Brien, I came into this inquiry after talking to some dairy farmers and having made a note in my diary, ‘How do we more equitably create a balance between the negotiating parties in these sorts of circumstances?’ where you have a large multinational company and a group of, basically, individual operators who are working under a collective bargaining process that has been set up under the auspices of the ACCC and the Trade Practices Act.</para>
<para>It is really a very difficult question, but it is one which we hear about increasingly. I also acknowledge Senator O’Brien’s comments in relation to the balance right down the supply chain, particularly in relation to our food products, starting with the supermarkets at the top and finishing with the primary producers at the bottom of the supply chain—if that is the way that you want to arrange it—leaving the farmers, in fact, in the place of being price takers. The influences on the price that the farmers get are multiple. There are the local conditions in the domestic market, and we heard a lot of discussion about those. I think there is even some conjecture about what those really are, depending on who is making the argument. Obviously, international market conditions have an influence in certain sectors of the dairy market. There is no question that those who are supplying the market in the manufacturing milk sector are certainly influenced by the global market, but the arguments as to the extent to which that flows through into the domestic supply for drinking milk is another question. The evidence that we have received about the variations in those prices around the country, depending on what were described as local market conditions, leads me to believe that there is scope to look at this further.</para>
<para>It was interesting to see that there were higher prices being paid at farm gate for milk in places where there was competition in the marketplace for that farm milk, particularly in northern New South Wales and Queensland. There were claims that related to cost of supply, yet cost of supply was one of the issues that the dairy farmers in Tasmania were looking to achieve as part of their negotiations with the companies at the time of the major dispute. It is interesting to note that when we looked at retail milk prices versus price paid at farm gate for milk there did not seem to be any correlation. In fact, some of the cheapest milk in the country was available in the places where the companies were paying the highest farm gate price for milk. I think that, again, bears some further consideration at some point in time.</para>
<para>There is no question that right down the supply chain there are significant pressures. We did start to receive some evidence as to where the profit lies in the supply chain. Certainly, the dairy farmers were not making much profit, if they were in fact breaking even. I think there is quite severe pressure on some of the processing companies and that gets applied down the supply chain, particularly by the supermarkets.</para>
<para>One of the things that interested me and that came out through the evidence that we received was a process, or a factor, called waterbedding, where the price of one commodity within the market is pushed down and the prices of other similar products are pushed up. That is particularly illustrated through the pricing of generic milk in the market versus what is branded ‘label’ milk. This issue was considered as part of the ACCC’s inquiry into supermarket pricing, and in my view the ACCC need to go back and have another look at this. They came to the conclusion, on my reading of their report, that there did not seem to be too much of a problem. I do not believe that; I believe that there is genuinely a problem. In fact, when you talk to companies away from the glare of public evidence and the spotlight, they are more than happy to say that they would like to see the end of generic milk because it was initially produced using what they would call marginal costs but now something in the order of 50 per cent of the milk consumed in Australia is of a generic label. It is quite clearly, in my view, having an impact on the price of the other products that are being supplied into the market by the major manufacturers, and I think that is something that we really need to look at.</para>
<para>The issue of price discrimination is dealt with in the report and our recommendations, and I believe that this is something we need to consider further as part of our discussions. It will be very interesting to see what the outcomes of the current negotiations that are occurring between the manufacturers and the major supermarkets on those generic supply contracts are, particularly in relation to price. It appears to me that the low price that is being offered for generic milk is also forcing manufacturers to charge a higher price for their own labelled product. This makes them, over time, uncompetitive with the supermarket and generic products. When close to 50 per cent of the product in the market is being supplied by supermarket and generic producers, I think it makes things very difficult for the other manufacturers of milk.</para>
<para>I would like to make some quick comments about one element of the report where we talked about the future of and the planning for dairy in Australia. There were a couple of views expressed in the report in respect of that, particularly on the Tasmanian dairy plan, which was promoting growth. One of the difficulties that we had in this report was that there were two Senate inquiries that occurred as part of this process—one through the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Related Industries—and sometimes, certainly in my mind, evidence was confused to a certain extent. There was some criticism from some of my colleagues of the dairy plan, although I have to say that I thought it was quite well put together and relatively conservative in the way that it was designed. What really brought this about was the global financial crisis, which nobody could have foreseen coming. Some of the companies which were promoting taking more milk actually took more milk, but I have to say the behaviour of National Foods towards their dairy farmers was just so short-sighted and really exacerbated conditions in the Tasmanian dairy industry and brought all this about. It really caused some problems when they said that they would not take more milk. In fact, they were penalising farmers for producing over a certain quantity.</para>
<para>I agree with the recommendation that, when plans are put together, consideration be made of factors that might crop up, as occurred in this circumstance. But there is clear evidence in my view that the global financial crisis played a significant role in the circumstances. I am very pleased that National Foods have started to repair their relationship with the dairy farmers in Tasmania. They are working very closely with them now. But I have to say that their behaviour in other sectors of their market still bears some consideration and they really do need to look at the way that they are operating because it is very disappointing. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise today to comment on the Senate Economics References Committee report <inline font-style="italic">Milking it for all it’s worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry</inline>. I think this is an extremely good and timely report and I join with my colleagues who worked on the committee in thanking the secretariat for the exceptionally good job they did. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for the effort put into trying to get a consensus report here, because a consensus report means that there is a much better chance of delivering the outcomes and the recommendations, which are very strong. I became involved in this inquiry from the start, as Senator Colbeck and Senator O’Brien acknowledged. There was genuine concern right across the political spectrum from Tasmania about the way that dairy farmers were being treated by the processors in terms of the prices that the farmers were being offered. It was very clear that they were being offered prices that were below the cost of production.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The dairy industry has come a very long way since the time that I was brought up on a dairy farm on the north-west coast of Tasmania. The farm had two brothers operating a small acreage, milking 120 head of cattle and with six bales in the milking shed. That was the kind of life that many people across Australia experienced on dairy farms in those days. Since deregulation and consolidation of the industry, whilst there has been an increase in the volume of milk produced and the herd sizes, the number of farms has reduced because they have had to get bigger in order to operate on the scale that is required to be profitable in the industry these days. Therein lies the problem: a lot of people have had to borrow huge amounts of money in order to increase the herd size and in order to buy the machinery that is necessary to carry out dairying these days. They have been vulnerable to the field officers from the processors coming onto their properties and saying, ‘If you buy a bigger and better machine, if you change your calving times and if you change your regime on the property, you can increase your production by X and this will be good for you.’ On a handshake in the paddock, which I still find extraordinary—and I acknowledge that it is the culture of the country; it was certainly my father’s culture as well that if you shook hands with somebody on the property then that was a done deal—these people went and borrowed sometimes a million dollars. It is unbelievable that the banks would actually lend them the money on the basis that a field officer said in the paddock that if they upgraded their machinery and bought X then production would increase and there would be a market.</para>
<para>That is what Senator Colbeck referred to a short while ago and the cause of the difference of opinion on the committee. There was not a difference of opinion on the committee about the behaviour of some of the field officers from the processing companies. Everybody agreed that it is irresponsible to go on to a property and encourage people to increase their production levels without an additional responsibility on the side of the processor to agree to take the additional milk, so that is clear. The difference of opinion was about the strategic plan for the industry in the longer term. I have a different view. I believe that the dairy industry representatives—from government, the processor side and the bureaucracy, if you like, of DairyTas and Dairy Australia—have encouraged increased production and given people the notional view that there is a very bright future for dairying, without saying where those markets are or actually qualifying, in my view, where they intend to process and sell into overseas markets. Until they get that, in my view they are being irresponsible in advocating for increased supply without indicating where the increased demand is likely to be and what responsibility they take for delivering those markets. But, in the context of saying that, I do acknowledge that in the midst of all this there were the global financial crisis and other issues which impacted upon processors—in particular Fonterra, in this case, not making a decision to expand in the way they had said they would.</para>
<para>In commenting on this report, I want to say that I am really quite excited about it, because I listened to not only dairy farmers but vegetable growers and other primary producers in Tasmania and around the country. They are all saying that the problem for them is that they just cannot get a decent price because of the duopoly between Coles and Woolworths—it is just impossible these days—and because of the way that the Trade Practices Act operates. Also, the ACCC is both the organisation that approves a merger and the organisation which then determines whether there is excessive competition or not enough competition in the marketplace. All this has to be changed.</para>
<para>So this report goes beyond the dairy industry in saying that we want a review by the Productivity Commission of National Competition Policy. I am so excited about this, but my excitement is nothing compared with that of former Senator Dee Margetts. She does not know yet but I imagine she will be so excited when she knows about this, because she has done her PhD on competition policy and its complete failure in Australia. A lot of claims were made a decade or more ago, when we established National Competition Policy, about how it was going to increase competition, but look around Australia in the primary industry sector: it has done the exact opposite. If we get an evaluation of National Competition Policy we will at last go back to some sense in relation to this.</para>
<para>There are a couple of other issues that I want to comment on. One is the Trade Practices Act. As a result of the repeal of section 49 of the Trade Practices Act, corporations were prohibited from discriminating between buyers of goods of like grade and quality in relation to the price of those goods if that discrimination was of such a degree or of such a recurring or systemic nature that it would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in the market. But that was repealed in 1995 and what happened was that other provisions did not kick in to regulate the issue, so now we have the retailers engaging in price discrimination. There is absolutely no doubt about that. Generic milk is the same as branded milk, yet they discriminate on the basis of price and there is nothing anyone can do about it because of the repeal of section 49. Section 46 does not do it. We definitely need the review of the Trade Practices Act. I would have liked to go further than my colleagues. There is a note in the report that says that the Greens would ban generic milk—and I would if I could—but my colleagues thought that was a bridge too far. But at least I acknowledge they all recognise the problem that is there, because the differential between branded price and generic price is higher for milk than for any other product. On many occasions there is a 33 per cent difference in milk price, which does not occur in other products, and it is exactly the same product; it is just different packaging. If that is not price discrimination then I do not know what is, so we have to deal with this issue.</para>
<para>This report recommends a review of trade practices, a look at restoring provisions around section 49—the whole price discrimination issue—and the evaluation of National Competition Policy. There are also specific recommendations regarding collective bargaining and labelling and so on. I think our colleagues in the dairy industry around Australia are going to really welcome this report from the Senate. They will become excited about it only if they see that the government is prepared to move on it, because now there is a consensus in the Senate that we have to look at trade practices and at National Competition Policy—we have to do these things. Let us hope we will get some action on it, because we only have a temporary ceasefire, in my view, with dairy farmers and the processors for the moment. It can degenerate at any time depending on what happens, for a range of reasons. I would like to fix it in the long run, separate the powers of the ACCC, restore the powers under the Trade Practices Act and have a really good look at whether National Competition Policy has been a panacea and at the claims that were made at the time so that somebody is accountable for them, because out there in rural and regional Australia a lot of people have suffered because those claims have never been substantiated.</para>

</talker>
<para>—While all sides of politics can agree that the people-smuggling trade appallingly exploits innocent individuals who are desperate for freedom and desperately fleeing persecution, the Greens do not believe that the <inline ref="R4295">Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010</inline> deals with those issues, as I said in my earlier remarks in this debate. Rather, we have a situation where providing humanitarian assistance to asylum seekers could be criminalised under this bill, particularly as it fails to reflect our obligations under the current international anti-people-smuggling protocol. We are a signatory to that protocol yet its definition is not used in this legislation. The protocol that we are a signatory to specifically states that it does not aim to punish individuals who assist smuggled persons purely for humanitarian reasons. That is the difference between it and this bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The fact that the government has failed to commit to a charter of rights, which would enshrine our commitments under international law and provide an avenue for human rights challenges in Australian courts, gives cause for concern with this legislation, particularly when it unintentionally captures innocent individuals simply because it is so poorly drafted and broad, does not include the correct definitions and, therefore, does not fulfil its aim to criminalise genuine people smuggling. The bill does not reflect the issues in relation to people that are helped on humanitarian grounds.</para>
<para>Given the lack of consultation with the legal profession about the impact that this legislation will have on civil liberties, as well as the failure of these proposed new measures to adhere to our commitments under international law, I move a second reading amendment on behalf of the Greens:</para>
<quote>
<para>At the end of the motion, add: “and further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the first sitting day after:</para>
</quote>
<amendments>
<amendment>
<para class="indenta">      (a)     the bill has been subjected to inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, proposed by the Government as part of its new Human Rights Framework; and</para>
<para class="indenta">      (b)     a statement of the bill’s compatibility with Australia’s international obligations has been produced and tabled in the Senate”.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">The government say that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Human Rights Subcommittee is their new measure for moving forward with any legislation that has questions around its compatibility with human rights and international law. Why not let this bill be the first one to go through this committee? If the government are honestly committed to ensuring that individuals’ human rights are not violated and that legislation is not flawed in relation to human rights and civil liberties, then they should let this legislation go through that process. The Greens will not be supporting this legislation going to the next stage until it has moved through that committee and a statement of its compatibility with our international obligations is tabled in the parliament. Why would the government, after announcing that this is their new process and that this is what they are committed to, not take the opportunity to test it out with such an important piece of legislation?</para>
<para>It is clear from various submissions provided to the Senate committee which looked into this legislation—the committee inquiry which was rushed and whose report is one of the poorest I have seen in my short time here in the Senate—that the new offence in the amendments to the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Migration Act 1958 is too broad and ineffective, particularly in the ambiguous reference to material support, which I spoke about earlier. Not only is this term vague and indeterminate, with concerns about fairness and due process, but it also presents problems with our obligations under international law, including the refugee convention.</para>
<para>Australia is a signatory to the anti-people-smuggling protocol, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, yet all the legal evidence given to the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation raised concerns that it breaches our commitments to them. In particular, article 6 of the protocol against the smuggling of migrants requires states to criminalise specified conduct:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… when committed … in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Yet that has been left out of this piece of legislation. This requirement already exists in the people-smuggling offences under the Criminal Code. Why do we need this definition of material support, which does not offer any more clarity about the types of issues and individuals which this legislation will deal with? Under this bill, the requirement for a profit motive to exist is omitted. So, if a person helped somebody to escape an awful situation where they were fleeing for their life or from persecution, this bill would say that the person helping that individual is a criminal, without even a transfer of money. It simply does not make sense in relation to what the government suggests is the intent of this legislation.</para>
<para>It is obvious that there is strong concern that, if this legislation is passed in its current form, it would criminalise activities of aid organisations, humanitarian workers, charity and church workers and other individuals who assist people across borders for humanitarian reasons. Why is it that the government has not included the international definition of people smuggling? If the government intends to tackle genuine people smugglers, then why is that not clearly defined in this legislation? There is really no argument for not doing so. Of course, that is why this piece of legislation should not proceed until it is further looked at. It is such a poorly drafted, poorly targeted piece of legislation. One of the witnesses, indeed, during the inquiry said that it was the worst piece of legislation she had ever seen, and this was from a quite significant person in the legal profession in Australia. Despite having previously appeared in front of the committee long before the Rudd government were running the country—that is, during the Howard years—she still made the point that this was the worst piece of legislation she had ever seen.</para>
<para>It is clear from the government’s own submissions that there has not been adequate time to consider this bill. The failure of the government to articulate why it is necessary to introduce the new measures proposed in this bill highlights why public consultation and debate are necessary. I strongly urge the Senate to support the second reading amendment put forward by the Greens that suggests that this bill should not proceed until it is further scrutinised and checked off by the new Human Rights Subcommittee so that we can really have an understanding of the impact it will have. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—In speaking on the <inline ref="R4295">Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010,</inline> I want to start by acknowledging that on budget day the 123rd arrival of a suspected illegal entry vessel occurred—that is, 123 vessels since 2008. Here we are in May and there have been 55 vessels this year. They are arriving at a rate of three per week. Anybody experienced in this area—and I was the minister in charge of border protection in 2007—knows the season has only just begun. We have had 55 boats this year and the season has only just begun. These boats are arriving at such a rate that I checked various websites to make sure one had not arrived this morning. At any given moment, I suspect Northern Command is aware of several boats on their way, spotted by Coastwatch, showing up on radar or according to advice we receive from passing merchant and commercial vessels.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill is one of the most shameful answers to a collapse of public policy that this parliament, in its long history, has ever seen. The mismanagement not just by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship but also by the border protection minister and by the Prime Minister is absolutely unsurpassed in Australian parliamentary history. Having deployed troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East generally and in the full knowledge of what has gone on in Sri Lanka, to now say that we will delay the processing of refugees from those places because they are now more stable is an insult not just to senators’ intelligence but also to the intelligence of every right-thinking Australian.</para>
<para>It was five minutes ago, metaphorically, that the government was saying this was all about push factors. This piece of legislation is the most crass political stunt that this parliament has seen in its long history. We are now saying it is not due to push factors, as those push factors have abated such that there can be a delay and treatment of these people in a different way. So the defence of this guilty party in power at the moment has changed mid-trial. That is how strong the defence was when it started out—it was weak, it was a house of cards and it has begun to collapse. The confusion, indecision and misunderstanding in responding to this problem—this public policy issue that is at the forefront of many minds in Australia, particularly in my home state of Western Australia—and the public policy catastrophe that these ministers, including the Prime Minister, have presided over are simply outrageous.</para>
<para>The people smugglers are now so brazen that when suspected illegal entrants arrive in our waters they have the telephone numbers of defence personnel in their mobile phones. David Cody on the <inline font-style="italic">ABC</inline> highlighted the fact that one of the witnesses to the SIEV 36 coronial inquest told the coroner that mobile phones are taken because some asylum seekers have found the phone numbers of ADF personnel. How does this happen? The government is utterly asleep at the wheel on these matters if suspected illegal entrants have the personal mobile phone numbers of Australian Defence Force personnel before they get here. We know they will pull up next to Christmas Island, ring 000 and say: ‘Come and get us.’ This is an organised, corrupt trade that this government has inaugurated. When we were in power, they never had the mobile phone numbers of our personnel and they never knew about ringing 000. This is an organised, planned operation from within Australia that this government has presided over and, two years down the track, it is now belatedly taking some action. What an absolute scandal!</para>
<para>I now go to the SIEV 36 coronial inquest. On 16 April, an explosion occurred on board the SIEV 36 in which five men perished. The coronial inquest was conducted by Mr Greg Cavanagh, a jurist in the Northern Territory—a stipendiary magistrate. I pause to give him great credit for the work that he has done on this difficult subject matter. Pursuant to the legislation, he was to make recommendations and to proceed to find out what happened. He found out that there was an organised, planned modus operandi to ignite the boat. Of course, the government refused to disclose any of this information to the public, but there was an organised conspiracy by these people on board this boat to blow it up. At the time of the detonation, there were nine Australian Defence Force personnel on board the boat. This is what the government has led us to—our own soldiers, sailors and airmen who were on board that boat were exposed to the risk of being blown up by this government’s total failure in public policy.</para>
<para>The coroner found that all the adult passengers on this boat had conspired to tell other than the truth to the coroner. I want to take the Senate to those matters. At paragraph 12, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a group of passengers ... believed they were to be returned to Indonesia ... Notwithstanding that all passengers now deny knowledge of most of what occurred, I conclude that at least passengers Brahimi, Ghulam Mohammadi and Salman were involved in a plan to set fire to the vessel.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Further, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As to whether lives could have been saved—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and five people died in that explosion—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I have concluded that action taken by navy personnel was appropriate and more passengers might have died but for the action they took. Indeed, later in these findings, I refer specifically to the bravery of three members of the ADF.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say that many of the ADF members who were blown into the water by this explosion, and were injured, recovered and then assisted in the timely rescue and treatment of passengers, and probably went on to save many lives. This is a very fine day in the history of the Australian Defence Force. This group of people were intercepting a suspected illegal entry vessel and were exposed, as we now know with the benefit of hindsight, to enormous risk, and they responded magnificently. I want to commend them and I want to commend the Chief of the Australian Defence Force for what has been a remarkable response in very, very difficult circumstances.</para>
<para>In paragraph 18, the coroner said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">At the time of their deaths, the deceased were passengers on SIEV 36. A group of 47 asylum seekers and two Indonesian crew departed Indonesia in the middle of the night on either 10th or 11th of April 2009. Their destination was Australia. On the morning of 15th of April 2009, SIEV 36 arrived in the vicinity of Ashmore Island. At that time, the passengers were somewhat dehydrated, exhausted and seasick but none were suffering from any serious illnesses. One of the crew, Beny, had an infected tooth. A passenger, Talash, had previously had an appendectomy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And there were a number of children on board this vessel. This is what we have: 47 desperate people on the high seas, some in various states of ill health. What happens? After being intercepted and after the Navy had gone on board and cleaned up the vessel, we then had a whole host of issues involved in towing them for the next 12 to 13 hours. As a result of some of them mistakenly believing they were to be towed back to Indonesia, a deliberate act was carried out—as the coroner has set out. That act was recorded on a video from the vessel <inline font-style="italic">HMAS Childers</inline>. The coroner stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The camera was on HMAS Childers and had been activated within minutes of—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">the naval officer on the spot—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">calling high threat. That video shows that about 12 minutes before the explosion, namely about 7:33am, the passenger Brahimi was squatting at the bow of the boat immediately in front of the hatch where the unleaded petrol was stored. There was still one container of petrol in that hatch. The other had been taken by one of the crew members to the cabin and it remained somewhere in the cabin or in the engine compartment thereafter. That container was recovered and Beny said a photo of it attached to his statutory declaration was the container, when he gave his oral evidence.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Naval officer Faunt saw Brahimi at the bow and two naval personnel moved to the front. A person called Salman was standing in front of the cabin and had a cigarette lighter. It was Brahimi with the lighter and it was sought to be taken from him. A very short time after that the vessel detonated. We are so lucky that no Australian personnel died in this incident. Five people who were near the explosion perished. Nine Australian Defence Force personnel suffered ear damage, extensive burns and many of them were thrown into the water.</para>
<para>In dealing with some of the evidence, at paragraph 68 the coroner said that one of the naval seamen on board said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Salman was gesturing towards him and he denied that the other passenger spoke to him. He denied seeing the activities of G. Mohammadi. He denies any knowledge of how the fire started.</para>
<para class="block">69. Having regard to the video evidence, and what he had said previously in his written statements, I must conclude that his denials are not to be believed. He has lied.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is about one of the asylum seekers. The coroner goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">When asked if Brahimi was resisting—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">one of the naval officers—</para>
<quote>

</quote>
<para class="block">And so it goes on. The coroner sets out that there has been a conspiracy to deny an intent to destroy this vessel, which contained 47 personnel plus two crew and nine Australian Defence Force personnel.</para>
<para>What do you think the government’s response to these people has been—these people who have lied at a coronial inquest and who apparently in the full knowledge that something terrible would happen, according to the coroner, deliberately blew up this vessel? What do you think happened to them, Madam Acting Deputy President? This government granted them visas. This government has granted these people, who were prepared to conduct the most violent act of criminality not just to themselves but to our personnel who were rescuing them, visas. It is an absolute disgrace.</para>
<para>We then come to this legislation, which seeks to toughen up the whole scenario. The event on SIEV 36 was caused by this government mismanaging—bungling—the whole policy of border protection. The government stands to be condemned. Five people died that day, we were very lucky that other sailors and Australian Defence Force personnel were not killed, and the government has given these people visas in the face of this damning report by the coroner.</para>
<para>Of course, we have had other boats—quite apart from the fact that these people have mobile phones. We know that just the other day we had to send out a P3 Orion to a boat. People were put in the water to assist a boat of some 59 Sri Lankans. Five asylum seekers perished just prior to 11 May because the boat they were in had been at sea for some 20 days and had no food, water or fuel on it. That is what this government, in its stupidity, has delivered to this public policy issue: people in leaky boats coming across a treacherous piece of water and perishing. Five people from that boat perished. Goodness only knows how many boats have set off from Sri Lanka to make the trip and have never been heard of again. This is the scandal of these people with their crazy compassion and their ‘we won’t have children behind razor wire’. There are probably dozens and dozens of men, women and children who have perished in those waters because of the stupidity of the minister for immigration and a bungling, hopeless Prime Minister who does not understand the parameters of this matter, particularly in Sri Lanka.</para>
<para>The government’s real attitude was on display in an article by Andrew Bolt in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> of 13 May in which he talks about former MP Peter Katsambanis, who was a member of the Refugee Review Tribunal. Mr Katsambanis told Andrew Bolt that his former colleagues on the tribunal are under pressure to accept dodgy refugee claims. The article said:</para>
<quote>
<para>The management of the Refugee Review Tribunal has hinted very strongly that members should start approving more refugee claims … after the change of government in 2007.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is the cat out of the bag.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It was made very clear by management that long term career prospects would not be enhanced by continuing to make decisions that were lawful and correct (ie rejections or affirmed cases where that was the correct decision to make)—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, to refuse entry.</para>
<quote>
<para>One of the people deciding the next round of appointments on the RRT is John Gibson, a Melbourne lawyer who heads up the Refugee Council of Australia. He also appears in many … cases in the Federal Court appealing against decisions made by RRT members. The fact that this man is on a panel selecting or recommending RRT members offends every principle of independence of administrative decision making …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So here we have the system rigged, and it demonstrates the government’s quite misguided and stupid policy. What has the government delivered to this nation on this policy? Men, women and children travelling across a perilous piece of water, many of whom perish; Australian Defence Force personnel thrust into ever-greater risk in managing their arrivals; and a huge budget black hole of expense on Christmas Island and in motels in Queensland. Those things are what the stupid, misguided, so-called compassionate policy of these people has delivered. And we have to deal with this. We have to pick up the pieces. We have to fly the aircraft, sail the boats, man the surface assets and go out and rescue people at a massive rate.</para>
<para>People are losing their lives because of this crazy, crazy policy. When will this government wake up and stop playing politics like this crazy piece of legislation and delaying processing? What on earth does that say? It says, ‘We’ve lost the plot, we don’t know what we’re doing, but we’re going to look politically tough.’ I think Australians are waking up at last.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R4295">Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010.</inline> In following Senator Johnston’s comments, can I say that as I move around the country I find people are waking up. In this country where one out of three people has been born overseas, people support, and this country has always subscribed to, an Australian immigration policy that is built and depends on order and process. That has been the success of our immigration policy. It depends very much on our sovereign right to determine who comes into this country, and we decide in an orderly manner and according to a process that follows rules and regulations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Millions of people have come to this country and made an absolutely fantastic contribution. They do not remember the queue that they stood in. They perhaps do not remember the time they waited, but they do know that they came in through the front door. That is the message out there to the millions of Australians. That is why millions of Australians are very concerned about the breakdown of our border protection and, more broadly, the breakdown of process and order in our immigration policy. They came here, they respected order and process, they integrated into Australian society and they expect that their government respects those same principles that they were asked to abide by in coming to this country.</para>
<para>My colleagues have talked about the processes and humanitarian programs. Australia has been a very generous subscriber to humanitarian programs and accepting refugees—indeed, we take about 13,500 per annum. In my time, I have had the benefit of speaking to a number of people who have come to Australia after waiting overseas. They came to Australia and they have benefited from that humanitarian program. Many of them waited for years and years in camps overseas. They went through the proper processes, through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many women—including mothers and their children—who have been abused as a consequence of war and other circumstances overseas waited in camps. As far as I am concerned—and this is the expectation in our country—they are the ones who should be given first preference. We do not know the security status of people who want to jump the queue. We do not know where they come from. We do not know who they are.</para>
<para>As a consequence of this government’s changes, it is not just the person who comes in—either offshore or onshore—through the back door; it is also a multiplier effect that their families also come out to this country. It is very clear that the government’s changes in July 2008 started the process. The process started when Minister Evans announced the changes. You cannot change aspects of our immigration system—and, indeed, as a consequence of answers given at estimates by Minister Evans, there have been changes to about 26 programs in the department. Some have been small. Some have been major, like abolishing temporary protection visas. But the reality is that the compound effect of these changes has said something to people overseas. These people watch what happens in Australia. This is an industry; this is not just somebody who decides they are going to dodge the system.</para>
<para>Before I became a senator, I worked at the office of the Australian Government Solicitor for 20 years, where I saw this industry in operation firsthand at the grassroots. Senator Johnston talked about dodgy claims. I have seen my fair share of dodgy claims through the courts. That is the reality. That is the end effect of dismantling of a proper and orderly immigration process. So it is little wonder that we are seeing a budget blow-out. It is an extra $1 billion over four years, according to figures released in this budget.</para>
<para>This does not only affect the offshore arrivals; it also affects onshore arrivals. Yes, this debate has been primarily about boat arrivals; but this is also about people who claim asylum onshore. What sort of message has this sent to people who arrive here with a valid visa who then suddenly decide that they are going to claim asylum status? Every one of those people who is successful in claiming asylum takes another place from those 13,500 places that have been set aside for people who have been assessed by UNHCR to be genuine refugees. This is what this debate is about. It is about order and process.</para>
<para>In the end, I look at what this government has done and I look at its history. Yes, under the Howard government we did have a tough but successful policy, but this has a long history. The Howard policies had their antecedents in Labor’s policies. Let us not forget that it was Labor that introduced mandatory detention in this country. Let us not forget that it was Gerry Hand who introduced temporary protection permits. And they worked. They worked in that era, they worked under the Howard era and they will continue to work in the future.</para>
<para>So, when I look at the practical angles and effects of this, it is critical to the sovereignty and security of this country that we know who comes in, that security is not compromised at the expense of proper processes and that the necessary checks and balances are undertaken. I conclude by saying that this whole sad and sorry episode of the dismantling of proper order and process has, regrettably, had consequences and will continue to do so unless this government changes its tack.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Over the past few years there has been a lot of discussion about illegal arrivals in Australia—indeed, in recent months the debate has been hotting up. Almost everyone has an opinion—about what their motives are, about whether Australia should accept them, about how we process them, about how we treat them once they are here and about whether there should be offshore processing on Christmas Island. These are important discussions that we need to have, and I do not think many people would disagree with that. At the outset I want to acknowledge that this a complex and divisive issue. There are more than two sides to this argument and more options than the all-or-nothing choices that we are often presented with.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I also want to acknowledge that this <inline ref="R4295">Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010</inline> refers to people smugglers—those who make money off the desperation of others—rather than the arrivals themselves. I agree that as a country we should be taking steps to try to deter smugglers who charge exorbitant fees and offer pie-in-the-sky promises only to put their charges lives at risk in rickety boats and rough seas. We have seen in recent days this very example: the five Sri Lankan Tamils who went missing after their boat ran out of fuel somewhere to the west of the Cocos Islands. Those five are now presumed dead and the remaining 59 people on the stricken boat had to be rescued by the crew of a Slovenian freighter. If media reports are to be believed, this happened just five days after Australian authorities first learned that the boat was out of fuel. Apparently, the missing men had left the boat to try to find help for others on board, which included women and children.</para>
<para>Even worse was the SIEV X disaster in 2001. I note that Senator Faulkner when in opposition was outspoken and courageous in pursuing that particular incident. I think it was referred to as a Certain Maritime Incident in the reports. In that horrific incident, 65 men, 142 women and 146 children died off the coast of Java on their way to Australia. We need to make it clear that this should not happen at all. We need to show that Australia values human life and that we condemn the treatment of people as ‘just another commodity’.</para>
<para>However, I have concerns about the possible unintended consequences of this bill. My colleague Senator Hanson-Young, on behalf of the Australian Greens, has raised valid concerns that the bill could breach Australia’s international human rights obligations and I share some of these concerns. I am concerned that this bill is simply too heavy-handed. It does have good elements in terms of an expanded role for ASIO. That is a good thing. It is important that intelligence services and exchanging of information can nip the problem in the bud and prevent the people smugglers doing their business in the first place. Whilst I have always had the view that our intelligence agencies should be subject to robust scrutiny by this parliament, it is important that we have that exchange of information.</para>
<para>These concerns, and Senator Hanson-Young has articulated them very well, include the broadness of the definitions included in the bill. Under this bill people acting on humanitarian grounds, or offering financial support to refugees overseas, can be charged with people-smuggling offences. This bill treats good Samaritans the same as ‘for profit’ people smugglers, which means that under this bill the nuns from <inline font-style="italic">The Sound of Music</inline> could be thrown into jail. That is one of the unintended consequences of this bill. That is plainly ridiculous.</para>

<para>A few years ago when the Prime Minister was an opposition frontbencher, he wrote an article for <inline font-style="italic">The Monthly</inline> about Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the role Christianity should take in society. There was a fair amount of criticism aimed at that article and some derision of the Prime Minister when he was then in opposition, but basically I think that the Prime Minister was right, although the arguments he made could apply to anyone, not just Christians. His piece on Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a powerful piece. It was well written, well researched, and it made a point about the issue of moral imperatives in public life. Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a German Lutheran pastor and was one of the first and most outspoken opponents of Hitler and Nazism. He is famous for his writings on theology advocating moral imperatives and he assisted people out of Nazi Germany. He assisted Jews to escape Nazi Germany so that they could avoid the fate that befell six million people of the Jewish faith.</para>
<para>Reverend Tim Costello of World Vision—my good friend—has said that, today, Bonhoeffer would be considered a people smuggler. Interestingly, around the same time Bonhoeffer was travelling secretly around East Germany to encourage a Christian movement against Nazism, delegates from countries around the world were gathering for the Evian Conference. The conference held in July of 1938 at Evian-les-Bains in France was called to discuss the issue of growing numbers of Jewish refugees fleeing from Germany. While most of the delegates expressed their sympathy for the refugees, none of the countries, except the Dominican Republic, were too keen on taking more immigrants than their ‘quota’.</para>
<para>One of the Australian delegates was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas W. White, at the time Minister for Trade and Customs. His attitude on behalf of Australia was:</para>
<quote>
<para>It will no doubt be appreciated also that as we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to add:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I hope that the conference will find a solution to this tragic world problem.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So, in other words, Australia’s position in 1938 was ‘We are very sorry, but it is not our problem.’ We all know what happened in the events following 1938.</para>
<para>Last week, I received a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Australia’s Human Rights Framework</inline> which, according to the accompanying letter from the Attorney-General, ‘outlines action the government will take to promote and protect human rights’. Two of the measures outlined in the framework were the establishment of a parliamentary joint committee on human rights and the introduction of statements of compatibility with UN human rights treaties to accompany all new legislation. I believe the government when they say they are committed to human rights and to protecting Australia’s international reputation.</para>
<para>So my preference would be for the government to postpone debate on this bill until these two framework measures are established and introduced. This way, the joint parliamentary committee on human rights can then review this legislation in terms of our human rights obligations. It does not have to be a lengthy process. It is important that we deal with this, but let us put the safeguards in place. Let us not have unintended consequences.</para>
<para>The government can then issue a statement of compatibility on this legislation so that we can be confident in Australia’s dedication to human rights. This is an issue where there are literally lives at stake. Without the government taking these measures to ensure that we have the best possible legislation in place, the most effective legislation in place and one that is fair and without unintended consequences, I cannot support this bill in its current form.</para>

<para>—This is Australia and we will decide who comes into this country—not the people smugglers, as the Rudd government has been allowing and encouraging. Border protection is a fundamental concern to all Australians. Australians expect their government to keep their borders safe and stop illegal people or goods from coming into the country—and rightfully so. It is a basic requirement of any government to take care of our national security. There can be no compromise when it comes to our national security.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When it comes to border protection and stopping illegal immigrants from flooding our borders, this government is nothing short of a failure. Every day we read in the papers of another boatload of people caught trying to sneak into the country by jumping the queue, while people in refugee camps, who are waiting patiently, are forced to wait even longer because they have had their places taken by those who are coming by boat.</para>
<para>It is a huge issue for all Australians and something which is costing us hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayers’ money. Facilities on Christmas Island are at breaking point, with too many people flooding our shores for us to be able to detain everyone there. Now we are being forced to bring these people to the mainland, where they are practically processed in our living room. This is concerning many, many people. It is proof that the government has lost control of its handling of this issue and does not have an idea of what to do with the mess that it has created.</para>
<para>So what is the Rudd government doing? The Rudd government is just throwing more money at the problem, in the hope that it will fix the flood of boats coming our way. The Rudd government is spending $202 million in this budget on accommodation for asylum seekers. First we had Hotel Christmas Island and now it is Hotel Queensland. What is next—the Hyatt or Club Med? The Rudd government does not have a clue on how to handle the wave of asylum seekers flooding onto our shores—and giving them luxury accommodation is clearly not the answer. There is no way we should be detaining asylum seekers in hotels, because it just gives the people smugglers an extra selling point for their marketing.</para>
<para>Clearly the Rudd government is all at sea with its asylum seeker policy. The Rudd government is encouraging people to put their lives at risk by jumping onto leaky boats and taking the dangerous voyage to Australia—all because we are seen as a soft touch. We need to send a clear message to the people smugglers that Australia will no longer allow them to profit by preying on desperate and vulnerable people. The Rudd government needs to stop throwing money at the problem and start implementing a policy that will fix the problem.</para>
<para>I have been to Christmas Island and have spoken firsthand to people who arrived illegally by boat. The belief out there is that, as long as you pay enough money, you can simply jump on a boat and come to Australia, where you only have to wait three months and then you are given a gold pass into Australia. Why would you bother to wait five to 10 years in a refugee camp, when you can simply pay to jump the queue? That is the kind of message this government has sent to people smugglers—and it is just wrong. We have seen boat after boat stream into our waters, and you would have to have your head in a bucket of sand to say we do not have a serious people-smuggling problem.</para>
<para>I voted for the Rudd government’s changes to the immigration laws back in 2008 because I was against the barbaric laws which were put in place by the Howard government. But I accept that these changes have led to unintended consequences. The Rudd government need to wake up and realise that people smuggling is a real problem that is only going to get worse, and they need to be prepared to take more serious action. That is why I have put forward the idea of sending boat people to the back of the queue in overseas refugee camps—to stop people smugglers from selling Australia as an attractive destination.</para>
<para>Under Family First’s proposal, queuejumpers would be sent to the back of the queue at various overseas refugee camps and not given a gold pass to come into Australia. We need to send a clear message that queue jumping will not be tolerated by Australia. Every time we accept into our country a refugee who has come by boat, another refugee waiting patiently in an overseas camp somewhere is forced to wait even longer. That is not fair. For every person who comes by boat as a refugee, we take one person from the front of the queue in an overseas refugee camp. Clearly, they are jumping the queue. There are thousands of refugees patiently waiting in line in camps across the world trying to gain asylum, but boat people just push their way further and push those who have been waiting in the queue further down the queue. There is no way I think we should be rewarding people for jumping the queue and penalising those who are waiting in line.</para>
<para>Under this idea, Australia would take in people who have waited patiently in line in overseas refugee camps instead of rewarding queuejumpers. As I said, we need to send a clear message that queue jumping will not be tolerated by Australia. Australia is a fair and compassionate country and we should do our fair share to help refugees, but we should not encourage queuejumpers under any circumstances. As I said, every time we accept a refugee into our country by boat, a refugee waiting patiently in a camp somewhere overseas is forced to wait even longer. How is this fair on these people? There are hundreds of thousands of refugees patiently waiting in line in camps across the world trying to gain asylum, but boat people just push them further down the queue. There is no way we should be rewarding people for jumping the queue and penalising those who are waiting in line.</para>
<para>Of course, the real villains here are not the asylum seekers but the notorious network of people smugglers who prey on the vulnerabilities of desperate people and put the lives of these desperate and vulnerable people at risk all for the sake of making money for themselves. People smuggling is a despicable crime, and we cannot afford to go soft on these people. We need strong laws in this country to deter people smugglers and send a message that this kind of illegal activity will not be tolerated. I have always maintained that we should throw the book at people who engage in people smuggling, because that is the only way we are going to get through to them that Australia will not put up with their criminal activities.</para>
<para>Family First support the measures contained in the <inline ref="R4295">Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010</inline>—because, when it comes to people smugglers. there can be no compromise and no leniency. This bill will expand the crime of people smuggling to include those people who provide material support or resources towards a people smuggling venture. It also contains provisions which harmonise the people-smuggling offences contained in the Criminal Code and the Migration Act, making it easier for us to prosecute people smugglers when they break our laws. People smugglers have no respect for our laws. They endanger the lives of vulnerable people and they threaten the border integrity of this country.</para>
<para>Family First welcomes these changes, but they are still not enough. They are simply scratching at the surface. Until the Rudd government gets serious, this problem is not going to go away. Until the Rudd government looks at Family First’s plan and takes action to discourage people from getting on the boat in the first place, this is going to remain a problem for our country and remain a concern for many, many Australians. Even the UN has revealed that people smuggling into Australia is out of control. Now it is time for the Rudd government to listen, so that we do not all end up paying for this later down the track.</para>

<para>—I rise to end the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R4295">Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010</inline>. I first thank all senators for their contributions to the debate and I note the support of the opposition for this legislation. This debate has been wide ranging and a great many things have been asserted—some of which has had something to do with the legislation that is before the chamber and some of which has not. I shall try to confine myself to those matters which are relevant to the bill before the chamber.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is legislation which seeks to deal with people smuggling. Obviously there is broad agreement that people smuggling jeopardises the safety, wellbeing and security of those being smuggled. The government takes a hardline approach to dealing with people smugglers and the supporters and financiers of those engaged in this trade. We are determined to maintain a strong message to people smugglers that their activities will not be tolerated in Australia.</para>
<para>Domestic efforts to combat people smuggling have yielded strong results and since September 2008 there have been 138 arrests and 36 convictions of people smugglers in Australia. There are currently 101 people being prosecuted in Australian courts for people smuggling. The government has also implemented a strengthened offshore approach. In the same period, the Australian government cooperation with regional countries has resulted in more than 180 disruptions involving more than 4,900 people bound for Australia. Our regional partnerships have resulted in the arrest of more than 150 people smugglers overseas and this bill before the chamber complements the government’s plan to combat people smuggling by strengthening Australia’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework.</para>
<para>The measures in the bill will address the often serious consequences of people-smuggling activities, including the potential for injury and loss of life on maritime ventures to Australia and the targeting of enablers and financiers of people-smuggling activities. The bill will act as a greater deterrent for people smugglers and it will enable law enforcement and national security agencies to play a greater support role in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat people smuggling.</para>
<para>The ability for law enforcement agencies to obtain evidence through telecommunications interception and surveillance devices is vital to combating people smuggling and the bill will make telecommunications interception available for the investigation of offences relating to people smuggling. It will ensure that law enforcement agencies can make emergency authorisation for the use of surveillance devices for the new aggravated people-smuggling offence and will ensure that law enforcement agencies are equipped with the necessary tools to effectively combat people smuggling.</para>
<para>The government maintains its humanitarian approach to those persons who are genuine refugees but fall prey to people smugglers while it works to improve the situation of displaced populations in the region. The bill is consistent with the approach the government is taking. For example, whilst imposing new offences and strict penalties for people smugglers, the new offence of supporting people smuggling will not target persons who pay for their own passage or the passage of family members on the same venture.</para>
<para>This bill has been considered by both the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. I thank both committees for their work on the bill and on the matters raised. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended the bill be passed, subject to further amendment to the definition of foreign intelligence contained in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. The government has considered this recommendation and is confident that the proposed amendments provide the appropriate powers to achieve the intended outcome and will not be seeking further amendments to the bill.</para>
<para>The bill is a measured response to a growing problem and demonstrates the government’s commitment to addressing the serious nature of people-smuggling activities and to targeting criminal groups who are involved in organising and benefiting from people smuggling activities. I commend the bill to the chamber.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R4308">Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010</inline>. This bill is the final stage of what has been a long and much debated process, particularly for the professionals covered by the legislation. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act to streamline the recognition of health professions under the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions. The national registration and accreditation scheme is a significant reform commenced by the coalition government. There has been strong in-principle support for a nationally consistent registration and accreditation scheme for health professions. Jurisdictional differences for registration and accreditation requirements have hampered workforce mobility and made it difficult to monitor the small number of practitioners who have been under scrutiny or facing disciplinary action in a given jurisdiction.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The guiding principles of the scheme are stated as:</para>

</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">The process commenced with the Productivity Commission recommendations in January 2006 for a single national registration board and a single national accreditation scheme. The coalition government acted on the recommendations by reaching a COAG agreement in 2006 to establish a national registration scheme. In April 2007, COAG agreed on a single national registration and accreditation scheme to start in July 2008.</para>
<para>The health workforce underpins our health and hospital system. Health workforce issues are prominent in political debate and in the media. The coalition has a strong record and commitment to improving the quality of Australia’s health workforce, despite this government’s best efforts to rewrite history. The coalition government delivered nine new medical schools, including in regional areas such as at the University of Wollongong, which I was very pleased to support. There was a 50 per cent increase in medical school places between 2003 and 2007. Additional funding was provided in 2006 for some 605 additional medical school places being phased in from 2007 to 2011. The coalition government also provided 3,700 additional nursing places between 2005 and 2007. It was the coalition government that introduced funding for practice nurses through the Nursing in General Practice Initiative and later with additional MBS rebates.</para>
<para>Following the election of the Rudd government, the national registration and accreditation scheme stalled. The implementation has been delayed by two years and the start date is now July 2010. A key motivation for a single national scheme for registration and accreditation was to reduce bureaucratic red tape across the jurisdictions. Regretfully, it seems there has been bureaucratic influence and interference with the establishment and proposed functions of the boards.</para>
<para>It was only after the first Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry that a requirement was included for the ministerial council to give consideration to the potential impact of the council’s direction on the quality and safety of health care. A provision has been included for the council to first give consideration to the potential impact of its direction on the quality and safety of health care. A number of professions, including physiotherapy and psychology, have experienced delays with or expressed frustration at the process for specialisation recognition under the registration scheme. Clearly, the process has not been without difficulty and there remain some issues to be resolved before implementation in July.</para>
<para>The bill also provides consequential amendments to section 19 of the Health Insurance Act relating to Medicare benefit ineligibility for medical practitioners that are not authorised to render certain services under the practitioner’s registration. The coalition will not oppose the bill.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R4308">Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010</inline>. The Australian Greens understand that reaching this agreement on a national system for the registration and accreditation of the 10 health professions that are currently included has been a long and complicated process. We believe that reducing bureaucracy and making cost savings are very good for our health system where that is practical and where it produces good outcomes. We also support the concept of national registration. However, we do have some concerns that, in some instances, there seems to have been a lowering of the standards of accreditation in order to generate this one-size-fits-all solution.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will talk about a specific example from my home state of Western Australia. The standards of the Australian Psychological Society for their colleges and entrance into their colleges are quite different from those in Western Australia, where we have a much more focused approach on specialist registration standards. We believe that we have higher standards than those of the Australian Psychological Society. In the last few years since we have fortunately been able to access some of these services under Medicare, the society has allowed more people with no postgraduate training into their specialist colleges, something which the WA board has not allowed. This is why WA has the lowest level of membership of the Australian Psychological Society. WA’s psychologists have not needed membership of their specialist colleges to be identified as specialists. We have that already in WA. The WA registration board has performed this function—we believe a lot better.</para>
<para>The most important issue for WA is that the new system will have only the undergraduate level of training—four years of university training and supervision—registered to practise in all areas of psychology. They believe—and the Greens are concerned about this—that this level of training is significantly below international training standards. International training standards require, at the very least, masters-level training—two years full-time intensive postgraduate training and two years supervision. All up, that is at least eight years. WA has been the only state, and still is, which has registered this postgraduate training and two years on-the-job supervision, and hence has been the only state to meet international training standards. This level of registration in WA will be lost under this new scheme. It has caused a significant amount of concern in Western Australia, and I am sure that my fellow Western Australian senators have received emails and letters about this as well—not to mention meetings around this issue.</para>
<para>The endorsement process, which on the surface looks like the postgraduate registration, is highly inadequate—especially for WA. Firstly, although people with these postgraduate qualifications can be endorsed to practise in a specialist area under the national scheme, the specialist areas of practice are not protected at all. This is because a registered generalist with only undergraduate training—no clinical, diagnostic or ethics training—can go out and practise in all specialist areas. They just need to refrain from indicating that they are endorsed.</para>
<para>Secondly, the endorsement procedure is very flexible. This means that if the Psychology Board of Australia, for example, under pressure from government or others felt they needed to change the level of training for endorsement definition—for example, reduce it—then this could be readily done. It makes it much more difficult to ensure that we are maintaining standards. Endorsement is also confusing to the public, who look for specialists, not for ‘endorsed’ psychologists. This is of concern to the psychologists and their level of training, which ensures that the public know what they are getting and that it is the best. It is also actually confusing for the public, particularly in Western Australia, where they are very used to the specialist title approach that we take there.</para>
<para>We are concerned about the potential deskilling of the workforce over time. If an undergraduate can practise in all speciality areas but just not say that they are endorsed, why would they spend the extra time and significant cost to do postgraduate training if this is not going to be accredited and registered properly? We believe that the way forward is for WA to retain specialist title registration and the recognition that affords, which gives much better protection to the public and the community. I understand that this issue has been raised on a number of occasions and that it has not been properly dealt with through the whole accreditation process. There continues to be a great deal of anxiety in Western Australia around this particular issue.</para>
<para>The other issue about the national registration scheme that continues to concern me is around midwives and the linking of midwives with the requirement for indemnity insurance. I do appreciate that there has been legislation passed through this chamber which provides indemnity insurance for midwives. Of course, at the moment we have got that intermediate situation where we all know that indemnity insurance does not extend to midwives providing homebirths but all registered midwives have to have indemnity insurance. At the moment we have a two-year exemption where midwives do not have to have the indemnity insurance for providing homebirths. That situation is ongoing, yet needs to be resolved. The Greens will be watching this very carefully.</para>
<para>As I have said, the Greens have supported this process. We do have some ongoing and specific concerns, particularly around the issue of specialist psychologists and their titles in Western Australia. We believe that needs to be resolved in such a manner that Western Australia can retain its specialist titles. We encourage the government to engage with the Western Australian government and the Australian Psychological Society process in Western Australia to ensure that these psychologists and their specialist titles and training are preserved. This is not just about psychologists wanting to have specialist titles for the prestige. This is an important issue for the community. It is an important issue about standards and maintaining those standards in Western Australia. Western Australians feel really strongly that we should not have to lower our standards, which are good standards, to the eastern states’ standards. In fact, we believe that the eastern states’ standards should be raised to those of Western Australia because they are a much better approach and they meet international standards.</para>

<para>—I rise to indicate coalition support for the <inline ref="R4274">Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2010</inline>, following a practice that has occurred since 2001. The Australian Research Council Act 2001 stipulates that the act should be amended each year to incorporate the amount appropriated for the Australian Research Council and to bring up to date the details of the funds administered. This measure provides for an increase in spending of approximately $889.6 million over four financial years, applies indexation against the existing schemes and creates an additional out year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The funding supports three initiatives in particular: the Research in Bionic Vision Science and Technology Initiative, the Super Science Fellowships scheme and continued funding for National ICT Australia. The Super Science Fellowships scheme consists of 100 three-year early-career fellowships which will be awarded to some of Australia’s most promising young researchers. They will focus on the areas of space and astronomy, marine and climate, and future industries, all of which are very important to our economy. The Research in Bionic Vision Science and Technology Initiative is looking at things like the bionic eye, which we have heard something of recently. As I understand, it is one of the few initiatives to come out of the 2020 conference that was conducted here in Canberra with some of Australia’s best and brightest, allegedly. National ICT Australia has an important role in maintaining Australia’s research and skills base in the social and economic benefits that ICT capacity can bring. The opposition is more than happy to support these initiatives that are very important to the development of industry in the country and looks forward to seeing results.</para>

<para>—I rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R4253">Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009</inline> and the <inline ref="R4254">Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2009</inline>. The purpose of the first bill is to introduce a framework for the regulation of biologicals by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Biologicals are human cellular and tissue based therapy products that contain or are derived from human cells or tissues—for example, skin grafts used to treat severe burns. This legislation will have implications for the 20 licensed tissue banks nationally, including bone banks, eye banks, heart valve banks and skin banks, and also organisations which are working in the area of cellular and tissue therapies. The regulatory impact statement outlined a number of approaches to regulation: option 1 was to retain the status quo; option 2 was to regulate all human cellular and tissue therapies as medicines or therapeutic devices and remove the exemptions for transplant, assisted reproduction tissues, and human cellular and tissue therapies which had been prepared for a particular person; and option 3, which is the option that is being taken, is to regulate human cellular and tissue therapies as a discrete class of therapeutic goods, namely, biologicals.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the legislation there are four classes of human cellular and tissue therapies, each with a different level of regulation based on the level of risk. From the consultation it is apparent that stakeholders prefer option 3, which is reflected in this bill. Option 3 has regulation based on risk and clarity, has compliance costs lower than option 2, has improved consumer safety over option 1, which is the status quo, and is consistent with experience in the United States, Europe and Canada. Organs will continue to be regulated by the Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority and assisted reproduction tissues will continue to be regulated in the current way.</para>
<para>This bill is part of the overall ongoing regulatory reform being undertaken by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. This is the fourth in a series of bills implementing that reform. It seeks to build on other reforms agreed to by the parliament over the last year. The coalition has been broadly supportive of these measures. Human cellular and tissue therapies have been primarily manufactured by not-for-profit tissue banks and major hospitals. However, with rapid advances in cellular and tissue technology there is an increasing involvement by private sector companies and clinics in the manufacture of human cellular and tissue products, while medical device manufacturers may in future incorporate human cells and tissues into medical devices. Clearly, therefore, we do not need an update of the Therapeutic Goods Act to reflect that these emerging technologies and human cellular and tissue products can be regulated as a specific group.</para>
<para>The government assures that under this legislation all biologicals used within Australia will be properly assessed and regulated providing confidence for patients who hope to benefit from the outcome of these technologies. Biologicals will be included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and only those that are so registered or otherwise exempted will be able to be supplied and used in Australia. Biologicals can be exempted from the Therapeutic Goods Administration regulatory framework by regulation to deal with emergency situations, to allow for special experimental users or where substitutes are not available.</para>
<para>Criminal and civil penalty provisions are provided for in the bill to ensure compliance by those bodies and individuals involved in the making, supply and use of biologicals. These penalties are consistent with other provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act and can apply in the same way as penalties for the misuse of other therapeutic goods. The second bill complements the amendments proposed in the first bill and will ensure consistency with the approach on annual charges for biologicals taken towards all therapeutic goods. The coalition does not oppose these bills.</para>

<para>—I know that the <inline ref="R4279">Higher Education Support Amendment (University College London) Bill 2010</inline> is listed as non-controversial, but that does not mean that it is without significance. It is a highly significant bill. As Senator Stephens would know, while some people—indeed, some of my own colleagues—do not appreciate the full significance of the higher education sector to our economy, it is our third-largest export, so anything to do with higher education is critical to this country’s future. This bill foreshadows and flags the increasing internationalisation of the Australian tertiary sector, allowing further universities to enter into the sector and compete with Australian universities. Specifically, this bill seeks to enable the listing of University College London as a table C provider, which will allow it to offer FEE-HELP assistance to eligible domestic students.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Honourable senators will be aware that University College London, known as UCL, is one of the world’s leading research institutions. It is one of the great universities of the English-speaking world, and it is a great thing that this bill will enable them to compete in Australia. Enabling students to attend UCL and qualify for FEE-HELP signals the continued internationalisation of higher education in Australia. This is a good thing. It is a great thing for our nation. It also signals that with competition our nation cannot in any sense afford to rest on its laurels. I know the government is seeking not to do that, and the opposition will encourage them in that endeavour. The opposition certainly supports this bill.</para>

<para>—The Foreign Evidence Act 1994 provides a means of adducing foreign material obtained through mutual assistance as evidence in Australian criminal and related proceedings. The <inline ref="R4019">Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008</inline> would streamline the process for adducing foreign evidence, particularly where that evidence is a business record. The bill as proposed to be amended by the government amendments would displace the operation of the rule against hearsay with respect to foreign business records—that is, foreign business records could be adduced even when the record contains hearsay evidence provided that the other evidentiary requirements in the particular jurisdiction are satisfied.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The amendments would also enable the court to examine foreign material and draw inferences from the material in order to establish the material as a business record that may be adduced and would remove a provision of the bill which would have given the court the discretion to limit the use to be made of foreign material. It will remove a provision of the bill which would have created a presumption that foreign material complied with the testimony requirements in the Foreign Evidence Act and will make minor consequential amendments to the application provision. This would assist in relation to complex prosecutions involving the use of evidence obtained overseas, including investigations into people smuggling and associated conduct such as the provision of material support and laundering the proceeds of criminal activity. With those short words, I commend the bill to the Senate.</para>

<para>—by leave—The <inline ref="R4019">Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008</inline> has quite a history.

In addition, there are measures to provide for testimony to be admitted in Australian courts although the law in the country where the evidence was taken does not require such evidence to be given on oath or affirmation, or under caution, provided that there is an obligation to tell the truth.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The opposition’s consultations revealed some significant concerns about the practical effect of the bill. The following shortcomings were identified. Firstly, subclause 24(4) of the bill provides for material obtained as a result of a mutual assistance request to be adduced as evidence if it ‘appears to consist of a business record’. This is a departure from established principles of evidence, which require the party seeking to rely upon the material to establish that it is in fact a business record. In effect, this reverses the onus of proof and requires the accused to establish that the material is not a business record.</para>
<para>Secondly, the regime introduces a broad judicial discretion as to admissibility of foreign material, at the expense of the ordinary rules governing the admissibility of evidence. Thirdly, subclauses 24(5) and (6) provide that, once foreign material has been adduced, the material will be admissible despite any other rule of evidence. Exclusionary rules of evidence—for example, the rules as to opinion, tendency or hearsay evidence—will not be available as a safeguard. Fourthly, foreign testimony is presumed to comply with local rules as to an obligation to tell the truth unless evidence sufficient to raise a doubt to the contrary is adduced. This reverses the usual onus of proof on that issue as well. Fifthly, the bill has a retrospective operation—that is, it would, if enacted, apply to proceedings currently on foot. Rules of evidence are considered procedural rather than substantive and therefore the presumption against retrospectivity does not apply.</para>
<para>The effect of the bill, therefore, could be to expose Australian litigants to liabilities on the footing of evidence of a standard inferior to that which would be required by an Australian court. Accordingly, the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. At those hearings, both the Law Council of Australia, represented by some very senior practitioners including Mr David Russell QC, and civil liberties groups raised similar concerns. The committee reported on 10 March. The opposition members of the committee recommended that the bill not be passed in its existing form. The government’s response has been amendments which were circulated in the Senate in August last year, although it has taken until today for the Senate to consider them.</para>
<para>The amendments significantly truncate the bill. They provide that, once the court has determined that foreign material consists of a business record, it will be admissible despite the hearsay rule. Business records are an exception to the hearsay rule under the Commonwealth Evidence Act and, as far I can determine, in most other Australian jurisdictions. It therefore would not seem to make any substantive change to the law, other than to make specific provision for evidence that has been obtained from a foreign source under a mutual cooperation agreement. In those circumstances, in its amended form, the coalition is now in a position to support the bill.</para>
<para>In closing, I would like to record my thanks to those whom I have consulted in relation to this dense though, to us lawyers, intensely fascinating subject—in particular, Mr Russell QC and Robin Speed and Daniel Appleby of Speed and Stracey Lawyers, who were instrumental in identifying the practical shortcomings of the bill in its original form, as well as Mr Odgers SC and Ms Sarah Moulds of the Law Council of Australia, who provided such valuable evidence to the committee.</para>

<para>—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that, with the amendments that have been foreshadowed to us by the Special Minister of State and Cabinet Secretary—and in particular foreshadowed in the minister’s letter to me of the week before last—the opposition is in a position to and does support the <inline ref="R4164">Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010</inline> and the <inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010</inline>. The story of how we came to this position is a long and in many ways sorry one. What in its original form was represented as a considerable enhancement to the freedom of information laws of Australia—laws which I might say were introduced originally by a Liberal Attorney-General, the late Senator Peter Durack, during the Fraser government—in fact, under close scrutiny, appeared to be a very severe curtailment of freedom of information in this country. When these bills were referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee, that committee discovered in particular a proposal to remove the reversal of the onus of proof provided for in section 61 of the Freedom of Information Act so as to cast the onus of proof upon an applicant rather than upon a minister or the minister’s delegate seeking to defend a decision to refuse to disclose information.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>To understand why this is such an important issue, it is important to appreciate this. Freedom of information laws operate on the assumption that, unless cause is shown by government why information ought to be withheld from a citizen, the information should be available to the citizen. There are perfectly appropriate exceptions made to that principle, the most obvious of which of course is in relation to national security. There are others as well, including protection of other people’s privacy, protection of commercial-in-confidence information and so on. If a refusal of an application under the Freedom of Information Act occurs then the applicant—that is, the citizen seeking the availability of the information—has a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It has always been the case that a party seeking to overturn an adverse decision or a refusal by the minister has had the benefit of a reverse onus. That is what section 61 of the act provided. That has always been uncontroversial.</para>
<para>I have taken the trouble of going as far back as to look at the original report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs of November 1979, which reported on the first iteration of the Freedom of Information Act—that is, the Freedom of Information Bill 1978. I discovered that, from the very first occasion that freedom of information legislation was introduced into this chamber, it has been uncontroversial that a citizen who is faced with the refusal of an access request and wishes to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to overturn that refusal enjoys a reverse onus—that is, before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal it remains for the government, for the minister or his delegate, to justify the refusal to grant access to the citizen.</para>
<para>There is a very important reason why that should be so. Once an application for access to a document is refused, the applicant has no way of testing whether or not the appropriate criteria and statutory tests have been observed by the decision maker who was responsible for the refusal. How on earth is an applicant appealing to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to be in a position even so much as to mount an argument as to why the decision about refusal of access to a document was wrong when ex hypothesi they cannot have the document themselves? They would not be able in any conceivable set of circumstances to discharge an onus of proof that lay upon them to show why the decision was wrong. In the words used by coalition senators in their dissenting report following the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee’s hearing:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The government, the decision maker, the minister or his delegate have a monopoly of information, so the practical effect of removing the reverse onus in section 61 of the act would be to make any decision to refuse access for all intents and purposes unchallengeable on appeal.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Yet in their original form that is what these bills sought to do. Under cover of a lot of rhetoric about reforming and expanding freedom of information laws, what the Rudd government was originally planning to do in these bills was to remove the reverse onus in section 61 so as to make any refusal of access to a document practically unchallengeable. It would have been the greatest reversal of freedom of information practice in the history of the Freedom of Information Act. Astonishingly and to the very great discredit of those responsible for the preparation of the bills and their presentation to the Senate committee, this fundamental change—this extremely significant and deleterious change to section 61 of the act—was in fact included in a schedule presented to the Senate committee as a miscellaneous technical amendment.</para>
<para>Just think about that. Dwell and reflect for a moment on the supreme irony that, in a bill which falsely claimed to be expanding and reforming the freedom of information regime, an amendment which would have set back the regime to make it practically unworkable was itself concealed from the Senate committee by being treated as a technical minor amendment. That is hardly freedom of information; a conspiracy to conceal highly material information from the Senate committee would be a better description. Nevertheless, due to the industry of coalition senators and, in particular, Senator Scott Ryan, this anomaly was discovered and highlighted.</para>
<para>A number of witnesses before the Senate committee who were deeply experienced in freedom of information practice dwelt upon the effects of the removal of the reverse onus in section 61. One of those witnesses was Mr Mark Robinson, who appeared on behalf of the Law Council of Australia. Mr Robinson is one of Australia’s most experienced freedom of information practitioners, having appeared in hundreds of applications both for and against governments and, in the course of 17 years, having sat as a judicial officer hearing applications under the New South Wales Freedom of Information Act and, in fact, having been the draftsman of the New South Wales Freedom of Information Act.</para>
<para>In response to an assertion on behalf of the government that the removal of the reverse onus of proof in section 61 would have no practical effect on the operation of the act, this is what Mr Robinson had to tell the committee:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is an irrelevant assertion. I say this because the applicant does not normally know what document it is that he or she is seeking, and he or she does not normally know what it contains. They may think they do but they may be wrong. And how can an applicant meaningfully assist the tribunal by presenting his or her case first and by bearing the onus of proving something? You only have to think about it logically, I submit. As an applicant I can stand up and say: ‘I put an FOI application in. I don’t have to tell you why I did it, because that’s irrelevant. I don’t have to tell you who I am, because that’s irrelevant. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with the document when I get it, because that’s often irrelevant—and I want the document.’ And I sit down. Now, how is that possibly going to discharge the onus of proof? It puts an applicant in an impossible position, both practically and as a matter of fairness, and as a matter of law. On one view of it, that onus could never be discharged, ever.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I put to Mr Robinson the proposition that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it is almost impossible to imagine how an applicant could succeed if he bears the onus of proof since he has no means of knowing what is in the document.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">When I asked him whether he agreed with that proposition, Mr Robinson said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Absolutely …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say that the impact of the government’s proposal to withdraw the reverse onus of proof in section 61 would be to undermine the Freedom of Information Act. He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The most stark way to appreciate this is to accept that, in most FOI cases since the beginning of the FOI Act, in the AAT the Commonwealth goes first. The Commonwealth agency has presented its case first in every case I have been involved in and in almost every case that I am aware of … third parties who want to preserve their trade secrets may sometimes come in. They are called reverse FOI applications by other people. The situation is different there, but in the ordinary FOI case of an FOI applicant wanting a document from the Commonwealth the Commonwealth goes first. This will change that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I asked Mr Robinson whether he agreed that the effect of section 61 was at variance with the declaration of intent in the objects clause of the bill that it would expand access to information. Mr Robinson said that, yes, he did. In response to questions from Senator Scott Ryan, Professor Spencer Zifcak, the Vice-President of Liberty Victoria, also expressed concern that the removal of the onus of proof would, for all practical purposes, undermine the operation of the FOI Act.</para>
<para>Government senators in their majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs thought that they had reached a halfway point by suggesting that perhaps there could be no onus of proof provision in the amended act. But, of course, that does not meet the objection. An applicant for information under the FOI Act, faced with a situation in which a monopoly of knowledge is possessed by those who have refused an access application, is in no better position if there is no onus of proof than if the onus of proof lies upon them. The only way that FOI practice can be observed is if the onus of proof—the onus of upholding the refusal to provide information, in other words—lies on the decision maker—that is, the minister or their delegate because only they, as I have said in my remarks, are in a position to know what is in the document whose disclosure they are resisting.</para>
<para>I am pleased to say that at long last the minister, Senator Ludwig, saw the sense in what the opposition was saying and saw the sense in what was contained in the coalition senators’ minority report. In a letter which he directed to me the week before last Senator Ludwig capitulated on the issue of onus of proof just as the government capitulated on a number of other issues which will form the government amendments which are about to be moved by the minister. It is for that reason that the opposition now find ourselves in a position in which we are able to support this legislation. We support its intent; we support the other aspects of the legislation which I have not dwelt upon in these remarks. The only reason this legislation has now become uncontroversial is that the government capitulated to the opposition. The government was found out in trying to slip past the Senate and a Senate committee, under the ruse that it was a technical amendment only, a proposal which would have rendered unworkable the entire scheme of Australia’s freedom of information legislation.</para>
<para>There is so much heroic rhetoric from the Rudd government. This is yet another example of the total disconnect between the heroic rhetoric of the Rudd government and the reality of its very nasty and deceptive political practice. On this occasion, as on so many other occasions, the Rudd government has been found out. It has backed down from its attempt to distort and set back Australia’s freedom of information laws. I particularly want to thank Senator Scott Ryan for his efforts in revealing this attempt to get what would have been a very, very deleterious amendment past the scrutiny of the Senate. In the form in which it will now be amended, the opposition is in a position to support the legislation.</para>

<para>—The Australian Greens welcome the Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010 and the <inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010</inline> and congratulate the government on having taken these important steps towards greater openness in government. I would like to add my remarks to those of Senator Brandis on the issue of onus of proof. He put it probably more eloquently and at greater length than I was going to, but those concerns were certainly shared by the Australian Greens. I suppose in this instance the government is to be commended for at least acknowledging, under the weight of overwhelming evidence, that it was wrong rather than, as we see so many times in this place, simply just pushing ahead. As a result this legislation, while very significant, is now being debated as noncontroversial.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Information is central to knowing how our elected representatives are exercising their power and to hold our representatives to account. The Greens believe that open and transparent government is a prerequisite to an effective democracy. We welcome the government’s commitment to a pro-disclosure culture and a restoration of open and transparent government. We also look forward to the review of the fees and charges because very significant concerns were raised in the committee process about the interaction between processing charges and application fees. We urge the government to bear in mind that the costs of fees and charges should not be prohibitive for the kind of freedom of information requests that agencies normally deal with. Access to information for an individual or an organisation should not be determined by their ability to pay, as such fees and charges need to be set at a reasonable level. We also look forward to developments in the application of freedom of information to parliamentary departments and would appreciate being kept informed of any progress in this area—it was set aside from consideration in these bills.</para>
<para>Senators will probably already be aware that we have a number of amendments that we will seek to move when we shift into the committee stage. I will briefly foreshadow them now. I do not propose to tie up the chamber for too long when we get to discussion of those amendments. I would firstly say, as is so often the case with this government and, I suppose, with the previous government, that this is a package of generally good legislation that the Australian Greens support. We concur that it will improve transparency and accountability of government departments and of course for that reason we are supporting it. But there is always a catch. There is always a poison pill, and in the case of this particular legislation it is quite a serious one—that the government has proposed to shroud intelligence and security agencies entirely from the reach of the Freedom of Information Act. The minister will be aware that I raised these issues when we debated a less comprehensive FOI bill earlier. Those issues remain. They have not changed, and the government is persisting with this idea that existing public interest immunity grounds are not sufficient for some reason—and we have never heard a justification for why not—and that in fact the administrative decisions of agencies, or the amount of paper clips that they are ordering, should be permanently beyond the reach of freedom of information legislation.</para>
<para>So the amendments that we will move seek to remove the current exemption from the FOI Act granted to intelligence agencies. We believe that the scope of exemptions from the act are central to the act’s effectiveness and we do not believe that simply because a document originated in a security agency it automatically has implications for national security and should therefore receive automatic and whole exemption from the Freedom of Information Act. If the Greens amendments succeed, security and intelligence agencies will still have the entirely legitimate right to prevent material from being released through FOI application processes under the normal grounds that they use today, including issues of national security, issues of operational secrecy and the kinds of legitimate public interest exemptions that, throughout a long history of convention in the Australian Senate, have been allowed as legitimate reasons for these agencies to withhold information. We are not proposing that those exemptions lapse or that they should no longer apply, simply that it is at best lazy drafting to simply exempt these agencies from freedom of information entirely. So our amendments go to that effect.</para>
<para>The second part of our amendments provides guidance for a review of this situation which is profoundly unsatisfactory to the Australian Greens. We propose that this review should take place after the act has been in operation for two years to ensure that it properly addresses the Greens concerns about wholesale exemptions from the act, particularly in respect to intelligence agencies. I will be interested to hear the minister’s remarks before we close the second reading debate on that issue specifically, in expectation that the minister may give us some commitments in this regard. In fact a two-year review is a pretty poor substitute for good public policy which would surely have allowed that security and intelligence agencies should not be beyond the reach of an instrument as important as freedom of information. In fact, these are precisely the kinds of agencies for which oversight by the public and by the parliament is more important than ever.  I will make a couple of other concluding remarks when we move to the committee stage.</para>

<para>—I thank the opposition, the Greens and Senators Xenophon and Fielding for their support for early passage of this legislation through the Senate, and I also thank those senators who participated in the inquiry by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010</inline>, together with the <inline ref="R4164">Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010</inline> is, after all, concerned with significantly enhancing openness in government. The Rudd government has undertaken the first overhaul of the FOI Act since it was enacted in 1982, nearly 30 years ago. The passage of the FOI Act was a milestone for Australia. The Rudd government continues to recognise that we are responsible and accountable to the people we serve. For this reason, when we were in opposition we committed to overhauling the FOI Act and we have delivered on this promise. This legislation expressly recognises that giving the Australian community access to government-held information strengthens Australia’s representative democracy, recognises the role that this object serves to increase public participation in government processes and increases accountability in the government’s activities.</para>
<para>The Australian Information Commissioner Bill will also establish the first independent model to oversight FOI administration. Many of the reforms within that model, which provide for a framework for agency driven proactive publication of government information together with the single public interest test, are contained within these two bills, but this does not mark the end of the government’s commitment to ensuring an effective FOI regime and that the amended FOI Act meets the government’s object of enhancing openness provisions made in the <inline ref="R4163">Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009</inline> and in the Australian Information Commissioner Bill. A full review will be undertaken of the operation of the legislation two years from the commencement of the reform measures. These bills comprise the strongest package of measures to enhance public access to government-held information that this chamber has seen in nearly 30 years.</para>
<para>In foreshadowing an issue that the Greens have raised in relation to the review which I just mentioned, I have included a statement in the second reading speech in order to address the concerns raised by the Australian Greens. The review will also need to include a consideration of whether the exclusion of agencies, including intelligence agencies, from the application of the act is still appropriate and necessary. Naturally such a consideration would require reference to international practice and consideration of what is in Australia’s public interest. The government would be opposed to the first foreshadowed amendment. We think that second part, both in the second reading statement and with my statement on <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, goes some way to addressing the Greens issue. I know it does not go all the way, but I accept that this is a matter that the Greens take very seriously. In this instance, the government’s position is quite clear. We have articulated that we have got to what we consider to be an appropriate balance in this legislation.</para>
<para>Finally, the establishment of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner underpins the government’s objective to revitalise the FOI Act and also lays a stronger foundation for privacy protection and improvements in the broader management of government information.</para>

<para>—I indicate that, as Senator Ludlam has anticipated, the opposition does not support the Greens amendments. It has been a well-established principle in this country that matters of national security, and like matters, are well within the appropriate exclusions from the FOI regime and that we have other mechanisms, in particular the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and recently, as a result of an initiative of the opposition in fact, the independent review of antiterrorism laws. There is a suite of safeguards which, in the opposition’s view, provide appropriate and searching oversight of the performance of national security agencies and which make it appropriate that they do not fall within the FOI regime.</para>

<para>—Thank you both. In concurrence with the remarks of the opposition and in addition, the legislation of course does not change the status of intelligence agencies, which are now excluded from the FOI Act. I also remind the Senate that the ALRC open government report recommended that the intelligence agencies should remain wholly excluded from the operation of the act. In its reasons the review observed that, if intelligence agencies were subject to the FOI Act, ‘the vast majority ... of these documents would be exempt.’</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In answer to your specific question, the nature of the functions of the intelligence agencies is such that those functions would be compromised by the public dissemination of that information. These functions cannot be carried out with the same level of transparency ordinarily expected of administrative action. For those reasons and the reasons articulated by Senator Brandis, we would not agree with the amendment.</para>

<para>—I do not propose to tie us up, but it appears that I am simply not being heard. We are not proposing to lift the ability of these agencies to continue to apply for public interest immunity on grounds of issues like national secrecy, operational security and so on. We are not proposing to lift those exemptions. What we are objecting to is the simple throwing of a shroud of invisibility over the agencies, giving them immunity from the FOI Act. I would put the question one more time, unless you simply do not intend to answer it: what is different about Australian security agencies? Why should the Freedom of Information Act apply to agencies in comparable democracies but not in Australia? If you do not have any answer to that question, I will simply put the amendments and we will move through.</para>

<para class="italic">The speech read as follows—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Do Not Call Register Act 2006</inline> (the Act) was introduced in May 2006 to enable individuals to opt out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by listing their fixed or mobile telephone numbers on the Do Not Call Register (the Register ). Only numbers used primarily for private or domestic purposes can currently be registered. The Register formally commenced on 31 May 2007 at which time registration lasted for 3 years. One month after the Register commenced operation, over 1 million numbers had been registered.</para>
<para class="block">The Government recognises that telemarketing and fax marketing are legitimate marketing methods, but considers that this must be weighed against the effects on called parties. For agencies of Government, for instance, the receipt of telemarketing calls tends to be limited value, causing inefficiencies and loss of productivity.</para>
<para class="block">For emergency services organisations —such as ambulance services, fire and law enforcement authorities—such calls can be an operational impediment. Emergency service operators have advised the Government that telemarketers are bypassing emergency numbers, such as ‘000’, and directly contacting emergency service operators through the use of predictive dialling equipment. Responding to these calls delays the response to genuine emergency calls.</para>
<para class="block">Neither Government agencies nor emergency services organisation can currently put their numbers on the Register.</para>
</quote>
<para>In response to these concerns, this <inline ref="R4239">bill</inline> will expand the class of numbers that can be registered to include the telephone numbers of government agencies and emergency services organisations.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Government has also heeded complaints that the Act does not offer protection from the receipt of unsolicited commercial faxes. Recipients of marketing faxes are affected through the direct costs of additional consumables such as ink and paper; from lost time and from the tying-up of fax equipment and other communications services such as payment systems.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill therefore introduces regulation of unsolicited fax marketing by prohibiting the sending of a marketing fax to a number on the Register. The Bill also makes consequential amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications Act 1997</inline> to allow the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to make codes and standards for the fax marketing industry.</para>
<para class="block">Following introduction in the House of Representatives in November 2009, the Bill was referred for consideration by a Senate Committee. The Committee took evidence that the extension of the Register to business numbers would adversely affect business-to-business communication and impose unreasonable compliance costs.</para>
<para class="block">Having regard to these concerns business numbers — other than business fax numbers—will not, at this time, be allowed on the Register.</para>
<para class="block">A recent review of the Do Not Call Register scheme undertaken by the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy identified that individual respondents strongly supported the extension of the registration period which is currently 3 years.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill also provides for the extension of the registration period. This change will be effected by giving the Minister the power under the Act to determine the registration period in an instrument. Initially, the registration period will be set at 5 years. This will apply to numbers registered after the commencement of the Bill as well as those numbers currently on the Register. In the event that this Bill does not commence before 31 May 2010 — the day on which the initial 3 year registration period starts to expire — any numbers that fall from the Register prior to commencement will be re-instated on the Register.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Expected benefits</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Bill will benefit those organisations, other than businesses, that are detrimentally affected by telemarketing calls by prohibiting unsolicited marketing calls or faxes. This will be of particular benefit to governments and emergency service organisations.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill may also assist the telemarketing and fax marketing industries in targeting their campaigns to those recipients who are more likely to respond positively to their representations.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Compliance Costs</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">There are expected to be some compliance costs for fax marketers who have not previously been required to use the Register. However, these compliance costs are expected to be in line with the costs that telemarketers incurred with the introduction of the original Do Not Call Register and are not expected to be large. For example, the current cost to check 20 000 numbers against the Register is $78 per year. In 2008, an independent study conducted by the call centre industry found that 90 per cent of call centres surveyed experienced no change in gross revenues following the introduction of the original Register, and none experienced decreased gross revenues.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Funding</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Government will provide funding of $4.7 million over four years to make the necessary changes to the scheme. Of this amount, approximately $3.5 million over four years will be recovered from the telemarketing and fax marketing industries through fees paid to access the Register to cover its operational costs. The remaining $1.2 million will come from a re-allocation of resources within the broadband, communications and the digital economy portfolio.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">This Bill will put in place a range of measures that will enhance the effectiveness of the Do Not Call Register and provide Australians with greater protection from unwanted and unsolicited telemarketing and fax marketing.</para>

<para>—The coalition will support the <inline ref="R4239">Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2010</inline> and, for the very detailed rationale, I refer senators and members of the public to the comments made by my friend and colleague the Hon. Tony Smith in the other place. However, I quickly make the observation that the way in which this legislation has been handled is yet another example, another case study of a government which does not know how to manage its legislative program, which does not know how to manage the affairs of government, which does not think things through and has to fix up things at the last minute. Here we are, at the last possible opportunity to get this legislation through in time, for its coming into effect by 31 May, and we have other senators who want to talk to it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Do Not Call Register is a great and very successful Howard government initiative, which has seen more than four million residential phone numbers registered. It protects those Australians from unwanted calls from telemarketers. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, with great fanfare, announced that he wanted to extend this register to business, government, faxes and emergency numbers. Right from the outset, we said that extending this to business would not be workable. According to the typical Rudd government’s modus operandi, late on Friday afternoon, on 30 April, the minister had to perform yet another backflip. He was trying to do it on the quiet when nobody was watching. We are now here mopping up the minister’s stuff-ups and we are given 30 seconds to deal with this piece of legislation just so as not to embarrass the minister by it adversely impacting on millions of Australians who want to continue to benefit from the protection of this particular piece of legislation.</para>
<para>The coalition does support the extension to five years, as has been put forward by the government. We think it should have happened through legislation rather than through regulation. However, to facilitate speedy passage of this legislation I will conclude my remarks on that point.</para>

<para>—I have been given perhaps a minute or two to talk about the <inline ref="R4239">Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2010</inline>. I agreed that this legislation could go into a position of ‘noncontroversial’ as long as I could speak on it. I do not know if this is how this chamber wants to work, but I do not think this is the way it should work. I want to speak on this bill; it is important. There are vulnerable Australians who are hassled and taken advantage of by marketing companies. I think it is pretty ordinary that I am given only a couple of minutes. I am asking the chamber to think about what it wants to do after question time and to perhaps allow another 12 minutes to be given to this particular bill, to at least allow me to raise some of those concerns. The Do Not Call Register is important. The last time this bill came before the Senate we argued the case very strongly that it was crazy that, when you put yourself on the register for not wanting unsolicited calls, your name should just drop off the register at the end of three years. This bill now extends the time to five years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In other countries you are on the register permanently—you do not have to keep putting yourself back on the register. As I said, there are many vulnerable Australians and they do not want to keep putting themselves on the register. People forget when the time comes up. The government may say that they will let people know that they have to reregister, but that is not the way it should be done. It should never be done in that particular way. Everybody hates getting annoying phone calls.</para>

<para>—I am not aware of the particulars that the senator has raised, but what I can say is that there have been a number of claims made about this important measure and that a number of threats have been made which, in my submission, are not well founded. They are based on a number of assumptions which are incorrect. I draw to your attention, Senator, that projects such as Gorgon in Western Australia have proceeded in the context of what has been a resources rental tax which has now been operating for many years. There are many factors at play in the decisions regarding mining. There are issues that go to questions of technical risk, there are issues that go to exchange rates and there is, of course, the fundamental issue as to whether or not there is a customer for the product that is being mined. We have seen that infrastructure bottlenecks have for years been limiting our capacity to respond to increasing demand, and that is why we are going to devote $5.6 billion from this new proposal towards permanent infrastructure funding that recognises the infrastructure needs of resources regions. We will be supporting resource explorations through a $1.1 billion resource exploration rebate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

This is a measure that will enhance the international competitiveness of Australia, and we take the very strong view—as does the Australian Treasury—that this is a tax reform that will see a growth not just in the mining sector but because of the measures that this—</para>

It is a pity the opposition did not listen to the answer that was being provided in this respect, if they want to engage in that. There is no point of order. In respect of the KPMG modelling, the minister does not have to mention a specific word, as seems to be the demand of the opposition. The minister can provide an answer which encompasses the issues raised within the question, and that is what the minister is doing. If the opposition are going to listen for specific words to demonstrate that it is either in relevance or out of relevance then I would submit that is the wrong approach.</para>

<para>—Thank you, Senator Farrell, for that very important question. The government has delivered a highly responsible budget. It delivers the right outcomes for the current economic times. The government has stuck by very, very strict fiscal rules to get the budget back in the black as soon as possible after the global financial and economic crisis—and it has worked. We are back in surplus three years ahead of schedule, three years ahead of any other advanced economy in the world.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let us look at net debt. Net debt will be halved. It is projected to peak at just 6.1 per cent of gross domestic product. Compare that to other advanced economies, where net debt is projected to peak at 93 per cent on average. Net debt in the rest of the advanced world is projected to peak at 15 times, on average, Australian net debt. The budget delivers the fastest fiscal consolidation since the 1960s. We have lower unemployment, higher economic growth and the lowest debt of any major advanced economy. In fact, many major advanced economies have no date at all as to when they will emerge from deficit. We brought this about by discipline. We have not allowed tax as a proportion of the total economy to go above the level we inherited from the previous government. Tax as a percentage of GDP is lower than that which we inherited from the former government. We have not allowed spending growth to go beyond a two per cent real increase until such time as the budget returns to surplus. We are not spending any of the revenue increase as a result of our stronger economy, which avoided a recession—unlike most of the other advanced economies—but we are allowing it to help drive the budget back into surplus early, and we have offset new spending by saving. We have delivered on the forward estimates aggregate savings— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Mr Hockey, the shadow Treasurer, said a week and a half ago that this budget should come back into surplus three or four years early. We have delivered. What we have had from those opposite are lots of claims that they will oppose various revenue measures. You have set the bar; you have got to deliver. You have got to deliver a faster surplus, having decided to oppose some of our revenue measures and having decided to oppose some of our expenditure cuts. That is your challenge: how you are going to deliver a faster surplus having laid claim to the idea that you can actually produce a better surplus when you oppose revenue measures and expenditure cuts. There are lots of glib ideas from those opposite. Let us start seeing detailed policy which delivers a lower budget deficit. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—As I have said, this is a very responsible budget, aptly presented, I think, as a no-frills budget. It brings the budget back into surplus three years earlier. The challenge for Mr Hockey tonight and for those opposite is: you have to take up the challenge of producing an earlier budget surplus—as you claim you will do—and, at the same time, indicate those revenue measures that you do not want to support and those expenditure cuts that you do not want to support. What we have seen for the last 2½ years, particularly under the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, is that you oppose revenue measures and oppose expenditure cuts and expect us to believe you can deliver a lower budget surplus. That will be the challenge tonight. With all those measures you have said you will oppose, how are you going to produce a lower budget deficit? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

What this tax does is provide for much more efficient administration of our resources sector, because it allows us to provide assistance to the sector for exploration. It provides for a new set of arrangements. There is a royalties rebate, which the states and territories have been pursuing. The tax also provides for a quite significant expansion of infrastructure projects within the resources sector. What our modelling has shown is that the tax actually leads to significant improvement.</para>

It will increase the level of employment. It will increase the level of output. It will increase the GDP of this country by 0.75 per cent and real after-tax wages by 1.1 per cent. The modelling says that this tax means that Australia will be more competitive and will be able to produce a higher quality and a more efficient industry. This is a measure that enhances the economic opportunities for working people right across this country. It is about sharing the benefits of the resources boom so that all Australians get the benefit of what are their assets. These are the people’s assets. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Defence representing the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. While the amount of compensation allocated in the budget is clearly insufficient, the Greens join others in welcoming the long overdue recognition of severe health impacts on Australian Defence personnel who were exposed to ionising radiation from nuclear tests. Beyond the compensation measures announced in the budget, veterans are also calling for full comprehensive health care in particular at a gold card standard. Is the government considering this and is the government aware of those calls? Will you consider payment of compensation as a lump sum, as is occurring overseas in other countries’ compensation for nuclear veterans? In particular, with the evidence of genetic effects of nuclear tests on children and grandchildren—the families and children of nuclear veterans—what will the government do for the second and third generations affected by their parents’ or grandparents’ exposure to this radiation?</para>

<para>—I thank Senator Ludlam for his question. I will try and deal with those areas of the question that I have some knowledge of. First, as Senator Ludlam mentioned, in this week’s budget there is a measure of some $24 million for veterans who suffered as a result of the British nuclear tests that occurred between 1952 and 1963 at Maralinga, Emu Field and the Montebello Islands. It is important to say that this represents the delivery of the commitment that the government made prior to the 2007 election to review the recommendations of the Clarke report which were made in 2003.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That recommendation of the Clarke report proposed that the ADF involvement in those tests should be declared non-warlike hazardous and, hence, veterans be compensated accordingly. As you point out, there has been a longstanding view that those recommendations should be acted upon. It was a public review and the outcome of the processes for the British nuclear test veterans was a decision to implement the Clarke recommendations. The government acted on and accepted the recommendations.</para>
<para>You made the point about lump sum compensation. It is true that some veterans are now arguing for a different form of compensation. My understanding, as a former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, is that there is an issue in relation to the incapacity of lump sum compensation under the Veterans’ Entitlement Act, but I will check that for you. As you might be aware, the previous government undertook studies that provided white cards for healthcare support only for the treatment of cancer. There was no compensation and no wider health support beyond cancer. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

I wonder whether I can ask you to take on notice the specific matters that I raised about the gold card standard health care, lump sum compensation for veterans and, in particular, the important issue of compensating second- and third-generation victims because ionising radiation—whether from weapons tests, uranium mining or waste dumping—can affect the children of people exposed to the initial radiation. On that issue, I particularly seek your advice on notice. Mr President, I have a supplementary question.

<para>—This is an important issue. In the spirit of trying to provide some information, where I am able to advise Senator Ludlam I will respond to the issues he has raised in his supplementary question. My recollection as a former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is, as I said, that the Veterans’ Entitlement Act does not provide for or have the capacity for any lump sum compensation. This of course was an issue when I was veterans’ affairs minister back a very long time ago in 1993. I am more than happy to put to the minister those other substantive questions in relation to the children of veterans. I have to be frank with you and say that I am not aware of any budget measure that goes to that issue. I am aware that the government has implemented the Clarke report recommendation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. I believe the minister is correct, that there is no budget measure in this year’s budget for the children of veterans. My supplementary question relates to the situation regarding the health effects still being endured by Aboriginal people who were also exposed to the British atomic weapons tests in Australia and who of course have received no compensation whatsoever. Has the Australian government made representations to the UK government regarding the current case before the United Kingdom High Court where the Ministry of Defence is appealing the case of the Aboriginal victims of weapons tests and the veterans affected by the British nuclear testing? Has the government made representations in this matter? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I will need to check with the minister about representations. I can say frankly that I am not aware of any. I am aware from, again, some 17 years ago, that £20 million was paid by the government of the United Kingdom for the clean-up of Maralinga. Some senators would be aware of that. I know veterans have said that this was for individual compensation—perhaps there was a debate about site clean-up. Beyond that, I do not have any information as to whether that specific issue that you raise has been progressed. I am very doubtful that it has. I am only saying that because I am not aware of it. What I will do in this circumstance is raise that specific issue with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Also, if there is anything that he can add on the other elements, I am more than happy to provide that to you as soon as I am able.</para>

The simple fact of life is that the Building the Education Revolution is a program of $16.2 billion which has been supporting jobs in local communities right around Australia—24,000 projects around Australia. We have seen 9,000 schools around Australia enjoy considerable benefit from this program. We have seen a full and thorough investigation into the claims that have been made.</para>

Our personnel work in dangerous conditions in Afghanistan where the risk of Taliban attacks is part of the reality of everyday life. One of my first decisions on becoming defence minister on 22 July 2009 was to direct a comprehensive review of the protection provided to our troops in Afghanistan to ensure that they did have the full range of protections that were required. Appropriately, the review was conducted mostly in the theatre of operations.</para>

<para>In response to the force protection review, the government will invest $1.1 billion for enhanced force protection capabilities in Afghanistan over the period 2009-10 to 2012-13. Since the review was completed, Defence has been working hard to progress and implement the outcomes of the review. Some measures have been implemented already, including improving countermeasures against improvised explosive devices, IEDs, and improving IED detection equipment. Progress on the other recommendations is well underway, including enhanced medical support and the upgrading and hardening of living and working accommodation in Tarin Kowt, as well as a range of other vital capability enhancements. I can assure the Senate that this work will continue to be progressed as a matter of priority.</para>

It will provide a sense and warn capability which detects projectiles in flight and warns our forces of incoming threat. Elements of the system should be in place by the end of 2010, with subsequent progressive delivery of improved levels of protection.</para>

<para>—As all senators would be aware, our forces in Afghanistan currently face a very high risk from both insurgent operations and improvised explosive devices, and of course a high risk from indirect fire. Accordingly, the government’s investment in force protection capabilities includes a range of measures to provide direct protection for ADF members from small arms, IEDs and indirect fire. So, in addition to C-RAM, which I have mentioned, there is hardening of accommodation in Tarin Kowt, improved route clearance capabilities, enhanced protection and firepower for protected mobility vehicles, new night fighting equipment, improved body armour, a new weapons system for special forces, additional military working dogs and a suite of improved intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. I appreciate that the minister admits he made a comment of a similar or like nature and will check it. I assume then—and this is another one he might check—that the minister is also retreating from his comments on radio 3AW on May 14 last year, when he said the government would ‘absolutely not’ increase the compulsory superannuation levy. How can anything he or this government says be trusted? Why shouldn’t employers fear that it will just go up to 15 per cent next?</para>

But, in this instance, we do not have a genuine attempt to raise a point of order; what we are now seeing is the opposition continually raising and restating the question and, in some instances, restating it differently from the way the original question was raised—which is impermissible—and then asking the minister to be relevant to that subsequently asked question, which is paraphrasing their first, which is not the case. The minister has been relevant to the question and is answering it in a way that provides certainty in this place and ensures that his answer is accurate rather than taking the paraphrased, restated question that the opposition have sought to raise.</para>

Is the government aware that, as a result of its decision to rush ahead with changes to child care under the National Quality Framework and as a result of ignoring the increasing cost that this will impose on parents and childcare operators, a childcare centre in Box Hill South in my state of Victoria is now going to be forced to scrap all its places for three-year-olds unless it can foot a massive bill of $1 million in capital costs just to comply with the new regulations? Given this, what is the government doing to stop more childcare centres shutting their doors and leaving parents without any place to look after their children?</para>

<para>—Thank you, Mr President. So the government is undertaking a very ambitious reform to the quality of child care. I do not have any information on the childcare centre that the senator has raised, but I am happy to seek out that information and try to provide it to him. The government has undertaken independent economic modelling and found that the average out-of-pocket cost increases for a family on $80,000 would be 57c per week in 2010-11 rising to $8.67 per week by 2014-15 for one child to attend full time a long day care centre. The future of our children is absolutely critical and we make absolutely no apology for improving the quality of services to parents, the quality of teaching in those childcare centres and the quality of vocational education to childcare providers. That is what the government is undertaking. The previous Howard government neglected the sector, neglected child care. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

That was a commitment that was given prior to the last election and it was a commitment that the government stuck to and delivered for Australian families.

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">12 May 2010</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">In response to the question from Senator Bob Brown about the new funding for Parliament House security, the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) advises that in 2009, the Parliament House Security Management Board (5MB) commissioned a review of physical security for Parliament House. The 5MB is established under the Parliamentary Services Act 1999 and comprises senior officers of the three Parliamentary Service Departments.</para>
<para class="block">The physical security review was undertaken by the Attorney-General’s Department. The review was conducted against the background of national security assessments in 2009. It was completed in August 2009. The Presiding Officers were subsequently briefed on the findings of the review, and requested that the Joint House Committee and Joint Committee on Security and Intelligence also be briefed. These briefings occurred in late 2009.</para>
<para class="block">In summary, the review identified a number risks to Parliament House and its occupants, and recommended a range of risk mitigation actions.</para>
<para class="block">The SMB supports the findings of the review, and the Presiding Officers have accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations.</para>
<para class="block">A central consideration for the Presiding Officers (and for the SMB) is that Parliament House is a workplace for up to 3,500 people during sitting periods and around half that number in non-sitting periods; additionally, we have an average of 2,400 visitors per day, including groups of school children and international visitors. Clearly there is a duty of care for us as Presiding Officers, and also for the Government, to ensure that Parliament House is a safe workplace and a safe place of visitation.</para>
<para class="block">Full implementation of the actions recommended in the review will require significant capital funding and operational funding. As a consequence, an NPP budget bid was submitted to the Government for consideration as part of the 2010/11 budget.</para>
<para class="block">The Government has responded to our budget bid with the funding which is listed in the budget papers.</para>
<para class="block">Subject to approval of the budget, the additional funding will be spent over the next two financial years on the following key actions:</para>

<para class="block">In addition, some actions were initiated earlier in 2010 using existing DPS capital funds, notably a reconfiguration of the public car park to move the bus stops and bus parking to the northern end of the car park. DPS has endeavoured to maintain the number of parking spaces for buses, cars etc whilst making these changes.</para>
<para class="block">Taken together, these actions will mitigate the most significant risks identified in the 2009 review. Officers of DPS can provide a further briefing to Senator Brown or other senators about the proposed works to be funded through the budget initiative.</para>
<para class="block">In response to the question from Senator Brown about other security-related works, DPS advises that it had already committed to a range of actions including:</para>

<para class="block">The SMB has been very concerned to ensure high levels of accessibility for occupants and visitors. The measures outlined above will be implemented in ways which maintain this level of accessibility.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked by Senators Colbeck and Williams today relating to the proposed tax on the mining industry.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">There is really only one constant in the debate surrounding this great big new super resource tax by the Rudd government, and that one constant is that the Prime Minister, in promulgating and advancing this tax, has not been honest with the Australian people. Further to that, he has absolutely no understanding of the mining industry.</para>
<para>This government, right around Australia, are on the nose with the electorate. After 2½ years, they find themselves in a most perilous position. Everybody on this side of the chamber senses it. There are baseball bats waiting for these Labor candidates in the next federal election, particularly in my home state of Western Australia. The workers, the shareholders, the fund managers, the airlines and the indirect industries maintaining equipment, supplying equipment and providing transport—all those support industries—are all waiting with baseball bats for these Labor candidates.</para>
<para>This Prime Minister has not been honest. These ministers have not been honest. They are advancing that this tax is like the petroleum resource rent tax. What an absolute disgrace! It is a misrepresentation—and, quite frankly, it is unworthy of them holding a position in this chamber. The petroleum resource rent tax is six per cent plus five per cent plus depreciation and there is a delayed timeline before it kicks in. This Rudd government’s crazy super tax on the mining industry of this country starts straightaway—it is almost retrospective. The Prime Minister knows that. Minister Carr knows that. Minister Sherry knows that. Why would they seek to mislead people? Why would they seek to try to fudge it?</para>
<para>This tax is a thought bubble from this Prime Minister when he could not get his emissions trading scheme through. He has had to fill a deep hole in his budget forward estimates and he has thought, ‘Where can I go that has some revenue, some cash? I will go to the miners.’ This tax is on top of state royalties—unlike the petroleum resource rent tax. Why would you misrepresent that? Why would you be dishonest about that? This tax is for existing mines, as has been established. Why would you misrepresent that it is like the petroleum resource rent tax? It is totally different.</para>
<para>Mum and dad shareholders who have invested good money through their own super funds or through their own cash in mining companies onshore—as we would want them to do to support our own people—have had the goalposts moved. Our sovereign risk is now looking absolutely trashed on world markets. The dishonesty has been exampled by Senator Conroy and finance minister Tanner, when talking about the National Broadband Network, in saying that the whole scheme would return a modest six or seven per cent—yet for miners, six per cent is a super profit! Coalmining in Queensland and in New South Wales is clearly for the chop. Electricity prices in Victoria are going to go through the roof when the value of coal put into the boilers is actually deemed a super profit. The mining companies of this country commit company tax, state royalties, native title payments, payroll tax and superannuation to the national good. This tax is going to take them up to about 60 per cent.</para>
<para>I say again: there are baseball bats waiting for these Labor ministers. State member McTiernan—running against our candidate Randall in the seat of Canning—has been begging Joe Bullock to go to Hasluck. She has seen the polling and said, ‘Get me out of this; I do not want not to go down the gurgler.’ We have heard nothing in Western Australia about health, given the Prime Minister’s grandiose spendathon on health. But I would also say that none of the other states have heard anything about health. There is no detail. There is nothing. There is just a doorstop and no delivery. There is a doorstop from this Prime Minister and no delivery. You have heard this from me first: it is bye-bye Gary Gray; it is bye-bye Stephen Smith; and it is bye-bye Glenn Sterle.</para>

<para>—I appreciate the forward warning that seems to be coming from the other side. I think it is much more tainted with optimism and hope about what will occur rather than any general advantage. Nonetheless, this tax is about having a fair taxation system in our country. This is an area which is looking at a fair contribution. That is all that is being asked. We are looking at profits that are super profits and we are looking at getting a fair return on the resources of our country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What is not surprising—and we are absolutely prepared for it because we have seen it over generations—is that whenever there is the introduction of a new tax there are the grim forebodings of the future and the outrageous statements about what will happen. We will hear that the sky will come tumbling down and the quarries will be filled in. What we are talking about is ensuring that in this country there should be a fair return to this country and the people living in the community for the resources with which we know we are deeply blessed with. We are not asking anything more than that. What we are talking about is that people are part of it.</para>
<para>We hear about the fact that there is no knowledge of the industry but the industry is involved in the process. We have a situation where now, after due process, the government makes a budget decision and decides that this is one way of taxation for our community. It is not an unusual process. It is one that has been used by many governments over many years. The Treasurer and the industry are going to set up a process where the detail will be worked out and where people can be engaged in the area so that it will not be imposed on them arbitrarily.</para>
<para>Companies that are making profits out of the mining industry in this country will have clarity about the tax they will pay and they will have clarity about what constitutes royalties and what does not. We consistently hear about this confusion. The process will be that the new tax will be introduced; no one has hidden from that. There is almost a proposal that this is a hidden tax—it is not. It has been clearly put forward. There is one industry that will be affected and the process will be there to work out and clarify these details.</para>
<para>I certainly heard the minister say on a number of occasions in answers to questions today that the KPMG modelling was looking at what this would bring into the country in the future: it would help the mining industry; it would help our community. Some of the profits that will be coming out of this taxation will be reinvested into important things in the community, such as the infrastructure processes. It is very important to the regions about which we are speaking, and to the regions I look after in Queensland, that they have absolute assurance about the road process and the improvement in rail. I know that my comrade Senator Hutchins will be concentrating on this area.</para>

<para>We are hoping that we will be able to move forward through this quite fair process and have an actual engagement with the community when looking at how profits can be effectively reinvested into our community. It is a fair aspect of taxation and a fair understanding of responsibility. The actual income that comes from this reinvestment will benefit the whole community. It will not be just sent overseas or taken into some other area but it will be reinvested into the areas which share in the profits of our community. It is a fair process. It is not dishonest. It is not hidden. It is something that will take us from 2012 onwards.</para>

<para>—It is very interesting today—I have been trying to work out where Mr Rudd got this idea from. It has fascinated me to find out where Mr Rudd got this idea from. Now I have found it. I looked up ‘Hugo Chavez’ and I found that in Caracas in Venezuela on 27 February 2007 it was reported that Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez signed a decree to nationalise the oil industry—the sixth-largest in the world. The decree allowed Venezuela’s state oil company to take a 60 per cent stake in the oil industry at the time. It seems surprising that the tax that will now be on Australian miners is 58 per cent. He is out by two per cent but he has arrived there. The article goes on to quote Chavez:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para>The privatization of the oil sector to overseas companies in the 1990s was ‘disgraceful,’ said left-wing populist Chavez at the signing ceremony in Caracas… ‘The privatization of oil is over,’ Chavez said. ‘This is the last space that was left for us to recuperate’…</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So well might you call your friends ‘comrade’, Senator Moore, because comrades they obviously are. This is the most bizarre piece of politics that has happened to Australia for so long—the nationalisation of the mining industry. That is exactly what you have done. You are taking 40 per cent of the profits, putting the corporate rate of tax on the remainder and you are absorbing 40 per cent of the losses. You have nationalised them to exactly the same extent—bar two per cent—that Hugo Chavez did in South America. Is that where our nation has now been delivered? It is not Henry’s view. This is something that comes from the peculiarity of the Labor Party.</para>
<para>So well may they call themselves ‘comrades’, because comrades they certainly are and that is exactly what we have here. Australia went down this path briefly—a bit of insanity back in 1949—when Labor decided to nationalise the banking industry, but we thought we had moved on from that. But the man who dwells at the philosophical brothel of ideas, our dear Prime Minister, had to try to endear himself back to the left wing after he completely deserted them over the ETS—after he left them behind. He tried to recant from it on <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> last night but, because he had to try to endear himself back to the left wing, he came up with one of the nuttiest policies that this nation has ever seen. It is startling that I can read something about Hugo Chavez and see awful similarities to exactly where our nation has gone now.</para>
<para>They say that nothing is going to change. We have already heard Tom Albanese saying they are shutting down projects. In my state of Queensland, as we speak, they are reassessing projects. They are shutting down projects; people’s jobs are threatened. You have given up on the people of Dawson and you will lose the seat of Dawson. You have given up on the people of Flynn and you will lose the seat of Flynn. The fly-in, fly-out workers in Leichhardt are not going to vote for you. This is something that is absolutely peculiar.</para>
<para>Then we had one of the most pathetic performances I have ever seen by a minister in this chamber when Minister Kim Carr had to turn around on a question and on microphone say, ‘Has anybody got anything on that?’ For one of his answers, he had to turn around and ask, ‘Has anybody got anything on this?’ Why? It is because this policy has risen up from hell and it has arrived on their desks and there it is. They do not care. They are quite happy with this ad hoc approach.</para>
<para>They completely and utterly burn Minister Wong and they have treated her like an oily rag. Why? It was because it was convenient. At the philosophical brothel, the dispensation of virtues comes at random. As long as the price of popularity is right, you can do what you like. Now will come the reshuffle. Now we have the nationalisation of the mining industry—our major exporter. That you would take our nation to this position is perverse. If that is what we have to come in this nation under the guidance of the Labor Party, it is perverse. It will put up the price of bricks, it will put up the price of quarrying, it will put up the price of cement and it will be part and parcel of you driving our nation into the dirt.</para>

<para>—That is right, Senator Abetz: guess who. We are talking about increasing the taxation on resources that are owned by this country. On 25 February this year in a parliament on the other side of the country—in fact Senator Johnston’s parliament—there was a question asked in relation to what discussions had been underway in relation to royalties. In relation to the royalties increase, guess who said this:</para>

<para class="block">The mining companies are aware of it, and some of them have expressed their views. I have to say that a few people who work around the mining industry came to me over summer and said,—</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">‘By the way, Colin, the mining companies are getting away with murder, they’re not paying enough.’ A number of people working in the mining industry have said that to me.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As I said I did give it away—it was the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Mr Colin Barnett. That was what Mr Barnett said. Let me just tell you what the independent assessment of the government’s resource rent tax by KPMG said. This is what they have published and you can see it if you wish to, Senator Abetz. They said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Introducing the new tax modelled as a resource rent tax has zero economic costs. Further, effectively abolishing the crude oil excise and state royalties leads to an economic gain because it encourages activity in the mining sector. Further, the cut in the company tax rate stimulates investment across the whole economy also relating to economic gain.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They further went on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It will increase GDP by 0.7 per cent and increase employment in those industries.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">You have the courage, Senator Abetz, when the budget comes in to the Senate, to vote against it, because we have made it very clear that three things are going to be attached to that resource rent tax. The first is infrastructure, the second is relief to small companies and the third is in relation to increasing the superannuation contributions. Do you have the courage to vote against that?</para>
<para>As my comrade Senator Moore said, you have been very optimistic about these things. You go and tell people in the budget that there was $4.2 billion put forward for road projects over 2010-11. Let me just go through a few of them. There is the Hunter Expressway, New South Wales; the Kempsey bypass, New South Wales; and the Sapphire to Woolgoolga project, New South Wales. In Queensland there is the Cardwell Range realignment. In Victoria there is the Kings Road interchange and the duplication from Waurn Ponds to Winchelsea. In Western Australia there are four projects and there is one in South Australia. Of that money, the government is going to put forward $59.5 million to eliminate 320 road black spots over the next year.</para>
<para>Then we can go on to a number of other things, particularly the magnificent investment that is going to occur in rail over the next few years to fix up 10,000 kilometres of track and to make sure that there are a further 235 kilometres constructed and that 3,771 kilometres will be upgraded. That is what you have to risk when you vote against it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>Senator Fielding has already indicated that he is not likely to support such an irresponsible and knee-jerk measure, and neither will this coalition be as irresponsible as you are. The Rudd government resource mining tax is nothing more than the Labor government’s desperate search to feed its spending addiction. That is all we have seen for the last two years. The amount of waste is criminal. In case those senators opposite are wondering why my colleagues and I get so upset about their needless spending, it is because it is because it is hard-earned taxpayers’ money that they are spending in such a fraudulent and outrageous way. It is money provided by hardworking mums and dads who are under increasing pressure to make ends meet. Labor has wasted billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money over the last two years and we know they cannot be trusted with the public purse.</para>
<para>For the benefit of the chamber, let me remind you of the litany of this waste. Labor promised computers in schools for every year 9 to 12 student. So far, only 220,000 of the one million computers promised have actually been delivered, and I might add that the budget blew out by $1 billion. They promised to cut spending on consultancies, but what did they do? They broke their promise and instead have awarded another $1.1 billion in consultancy contracts since coming to office. They promised broadband for a mere $4.7 billion, but broke that promise and replaced it with a $43 billion plan. In the process they wasted $20 million on a cancelled tender process and spent $25 million on another report by consultants.</para>
<para>They claimed to have all the answers on climate change and the environment. We know that in the Prime Minister’s own words he described it as ‘the moral challenge of our times’. But they have squibbed on the ETS, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars in the process to date. We have seen $50 million spent on climate change advertising and paid 150 public servants to administer the ETS. We saw 68 delegates sent to Copenhagen at $1.5 million, the solar panel blow-out of $850 million and the Green Loans Program cancelled after $175 million was spent. The list just goes on and on. They promised to cut the cost of living but we have seen that prices have continued to rise. And we have seen the millions wasted on the abandoned GROCERYchoice and Fuelwatch programs. Labor continues to struggle on basic sums, but one equation is very simple: that is that waste increases debt and puts upward pressure on interest rates. When Kevin Rudd makes promises at this year’s election, we know that his track record says he will fail to deliver and will waste significant amounts of taxpayer money in the process. Australia cannot afford three more years of Labor’s waste and mismanagement.</para>
<para>In conclusion, it is clear that this government is desperate to find money to pad its spending splurge. It has turned its sights on the tobacco industry and turned its sights on the mining sector, and, in the shadow Treasurer’s words, ‘This is a tax on hope,’ and on the future of all Australians.</para>

<para class="block">The Government agrees that law enforcement and the intelligence community would benefit from a nationally coordinated response to new and emerging communications technologies used by organised criminal networks.  However, it would not be appropriate for the ACC to assume the coordination role outlined in the recommendation as the ACC primarily has an investigative and intelligence focus. </para>
<para class="block">On 16–17 April 2009, the Standing Committee of Attorneys‑General (SCAG) agreed to a set of resolutions for a national response to combat organised crime.  Attorneys‑General also agreed to establish a Senior Officers’ Group to undertake work on the legislative, interoperability and information sharing measures that were agreed to.  Attorneys‑General agreed to a range of further measures to support the national response to combat organised crime agreed to in April 2009.</para>

<para class="block">In response to an Attorney-General’s Department funded report – Building Illicit Drugs Forensic Capacity across Australia – which was endorsed by MCDS in May 2008, the AFP, in partnership with the Department, has developed a business case for the implementation of a national illicit drug forensic system.  This business case involved significant consultation with State and Territory law enforcement agencies and would assist in achieving greater consistency in the collection and analysis and reporting of data on the chemical composition of seized illicit tablets, as well as drug identification and coding.  Importantly it would also expand the drug seizures subjected to profiling to include samples from State and Territory seizures.</para>

<para class="block">Currently, the ACC imposes standard data requirements on contributors and sources IDDR data from the most relevant agencies in each jurisdiction to minimise the incidences of double counting.  The ACC uses the National Illicit Drug Reporting Format system to process data for the IDDR. This system has enabled the ACC to improve the statistical accuracy and reliability of data.  However, ultimately the ACC must rely on the data controls established by the jurisdictions for the accuracy of the data it receives.  The ACC does not consider that alternative sources of data exist given that it is collected directly from police forces and contracted forensic laboratories.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3:</inline>  The committee recommends that Part II Division 2 Subsections 28(8) and 29(5) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be repealed.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Accepted</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The SOC No. 2 Act repealed subsection 28(8) of the ACC Act and replaced it with a new subsection stating that a failure to comply with requirements set out in section 29A will not invalidate the summons. As such, a failure to comply with the requirement to record reasons and attach the relevant Board determination (subsections 28(1A) and 28(2)) will invalidate the summons.</para>
<para class="block">The SOC No. 2 Act also repealed subsection 29(5) and replaced it with a new subsection stating that a failure to comply with requirements set out in section 29A will not invalidate the notice.  The effect of this amendment is that a failure to comply with the requirement to record reasons in subsection 29(1A) will invalidate the summons.</para>
<para class="block">This recommendation suggests that subsections 28(8) and 29(5) be repealed in their entirety.  However, the new subsections 28(8) and 29(5) state that a failure to issue a non‑disclosure notation under section 29A will not invalidate the summons.  The Committee’s report focused on ensuring that an examiner be properly satisfied prior to issuing a summons or notice, and that the reasons for issuing the summons or notice are recorded.  The requirement to include a non‑disclosure notation under section 29A is not related to the decision of whether or not to issue a summons or notice.</para>

<para class="block">The SOC No. 2 Act expands the circumstances in which a disclosure may be made under subsection 28B(4) to include making disclosures to the Commonwealth Ombudsman (the Ombudsman) for the purpose of making a complaint under the Ombudsman Act 1976.   The SOC No. 2 Act also allows disclosure under subsection 28(4) to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) for the purpose of referring to the Integrity Commissioner an allegation or information that raises a corruption issue.  ACLEI is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious and systemic corruption issues in the Australian Federal Police and the ACC.  As such, it is appropriate that a person is able to disclose a summons or notice to ACLEI for the purpose of referring to the Integrity Commissioner an allegation, or information that raises a corruption allegation.</para>
<para class="block">The SOC No. 2 Act also expands the circumstances in which a disclosure may be made under subsection 29B(2) to include making disclosures to the Ombudsman for the purpose of making a complaint under the Ombudsman Act, or to the ACLEI for the purpose of referring to the Integrity Commissioner an allegation or information that raises a corruption issue.   </para>
<para class="block">Recommendation 4 of the PJC‑ACC Report was limited to amending subsection 29B(4).  However, it is appropriate that all people who are aware of a summons or notice (either under subsection 29B(2) or 29B(4)) be able to disclose matters connected to the summons or notice to the Ombudsman or ACLEI where appropriate.</para>

<para class="block">Recommendation 10:  The committee recommends that at least once in each year the Commonwealth Ombudsman be required to provide a briefing to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission about the Australian Crime Commission's exercise of the coercive powers under Part II Division 2 Sections 28 and 29 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 and that Part III Section 55AA of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended accordingly.</para>
<para class="block">

<para class="block">The Government does not accept that the additional statutory oversight recommended by the Committee is necessary given the extent of statutory and judicial oversight already in place.  The ACC is subject to regular review by the Courts and through the existing capacity of the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman’s own motion investigation powers can be used for any part of the ACC’s operations, including examination processes and other matters related to the use of coercive powers.  For example, in August 2008, the Ombudsman released a report into the ACC’s use of powers under Division 2, Part II of the ACC Act, which provides the framework for examinations. </para>
<para class="block">Administrative measures have been implemented in relation to the Committee’s recommendation that reasons be recorded prior to the issue of a summons or notice to produce.  Reasons are now recorded prior to issue in all cases.  These administrative measures were reinforced by amendments to the ACC Act included in Schedule 7 to the SOC No. 2 Act.  These changes to administrative practices, along with a clear legal obligation to record reasons no later than the time of issue of a summons or notice, will ensure appropriate scrutiny and oversight of the ACC’s legal obligations through the existing legal processes available in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Courts.</para>

<para class="block">Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act), providers of remittance services are required to register with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).  On 23 April 2010, the Government released a discussion paper detailing proposals to enhance regulation of Australia’s remittance sector in order to combat serious crimes.  The paper includes proposals to tighten the registration obligations of the sector, and to empower the AUSTRAC CEO to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of remitters in appropriate circumstances, including if the person poses a significant money laundering, terrorism financing or people smuggling risk or has a history of non-compliance with their regulatory obligations.   Subject to the outcome of consultations, the Government proposes to introduce legislation amending the AML/CTF Act as soon as possible.</para>
<para class="block">The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act No. 2 2010 strengthened AUSTRAC’s ability to take enforcement action against reporting entities that do not comply with their obligations under the AML/CTF Act.  Specifically, it removed the requirement that AUSTRAC prove that an entity located in a foreign country is not an authorised deposit-taking institution when taking action against providers of remittance services under the AML/CTF Act.</para>

<para class="block">The Framework clearly articulates the benefit of a fusion capability such as the successful concept of the ACC’s Financial Intelligence Assessment Team, which pools analytical skills and provides shared access to multiple Commonwealth data and intelligence holdings located within the ACC.  The Government has committed to the development of a domestic criminal intelligence fusion capability linking a range of agencies and is currently focused on establishing that capability.  Any consideration of a fusion centre in the Oceania region should occur once the Commonwealth fusion capability has been established and fully evaluated.  </para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Response:</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Government agrees in principle with the recommendation.</para>
<para class="block">Before an organisation can be listed as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not a terrorist act has occurred or will occur) or advocates the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not a terrorist act has occurred or will occur). The statement of reasons, which is made available to the public, contains information which forms the basis for the Attorney-General’s decision to list or re-list an organisation.</para>
<para class="block">Regulations listing an organisation as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code expire after two years. The organisation then ceases to be listed, unless new regulations are made to re-list the organisation. To date, two organisations – the Armed Islamic Group and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad – have not been re-listed following the expiry of regulations listing these organisation as terrorist organisations. In both cases, the Government informed the public by media releases that the organisations would not be re-listed. The media releases explained why the organisations no longer met the statutory test for listing as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code. The Government considers that this is an appropriate way of informing the public that an organisation will not be re-listed, and considers that this performs the function of a ‘public statement of reasons’.</para>
<para class="block">The Government recognises that the Committee has a particular interest in these matters. Where the Committee requests more information on an organisation that is not being re-listed, the Government will ensure that the Committee receives a further briefing by ASIO to explain in more detail why the organisation no longer meets the statutory test for listing.</para>

<para class="block">In response to the Committee’s request, the structure of the statement of reasons has been improved. The statement of reasons now states the statutory criteria for listing under the Criminal Code, and clearly sets out how the organisation to be listed or re-listed satisfies the statutory criteria.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Foreword</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Australian community quite rightly expects the Commonwealth Government to care for our servicemen and women who suffer ill-health because of their military service.  This Government takes that responsibility very seriously.  In 2007 we announced an election commitment, set out in <inline font-style="italic">Labor’s Plan for Veterans’ Affairs,</inline> to convene a Parliamentary Inquiry to examine the health and compensation issues surrounding the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) F-111 deseal/reseal workers and their families.</para>
<para class="block">In addition to examining the health effects of F-111 fuel tank maintenance, with particular reference to the unique fuselage repair work undertaken and the health risks involved, the Parliamentary Inquiry was also tasked with considering the adequacy of the Government’s response to date.  The aim was to investigate whether the Government’s response was adequate and consistent with the findings of the Study of Health Outcomes in Aircraft Maintenance Personnel, 2004 (SHOAMP); and, whether the overall handling and administration of health and compensation schemes was sufficient.</para>
<para class="block">The previous Government provided access to benefits for some 700 RAAF personnel and civilians who were identified as having been involved, to some degree, in the RAAF’s formal deseal/reseal fuel tank maintenance programs.  Health care and compensation benefits were available to workers experiencing any of the SHOAMP-specified illnesses; with the Health Care Scheme available while a claim was being determined, and continuing indefinitely even if a claim was rejected.  The previous Government also paid one-off ex-gratia lump sums to eligible participants who had been in formal deseal/reseal programs, where they satisfied Tier 1 or Tier 2 criteria - definitions based on length of participation in the formal programs. Such ex-gratia payments were available regardless of a claimant’s health status, and were based only on a participant’s working environment.</para>
<para class="block">The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade commenced the F-111 Parliamentary Inquiry in June 2008 and took evidence and histories from the fuel tank maintenance workers themselves.  It also reviewed relevant scientific and health studies, and considered the services and support provided to affected workers by the Departments of Defence and Veterans’ Affairs.</para>
<para class="block">The Inquiry report, <inline font-style="italic">Sealing a just outcome: Report from the Inquiry into RAAF F-111 Deseal/Reseal Workers and their Families</inline>, was tabled on 25 June 2009. A copy of the report is available online at:</para>

<para class="block">The Government has accepted 14 of the Inquiry’s recommendations, some in modified form, one partially accepted, and some accepted with enhancements. The tables at pages 6 and 10 detail the Inquiry’s recommendations and the Government Response.</para>
<para class="block">The Government Response provides some $55 million over four years, expanding the definition of eligible personnel and the benefits and services available to them - to provide better access to care and compensation under the SRCA. </para>
<para class="block">The Response significantly expands eligibility for compensation and health care under ss7(2) of the SRCA, by recognising thousands more F-111 maintenance personnel who may be affected because their work required fuel tank entry.  An estimated 2,400 additional workers, (along with those associated with the formal deseal/reseal work programs) may now be considered for access to health care and compensation through inclusion in the definition of Tier 3 exposure classification, should they become affected by the health conditions linked to F-111 deseal/reseal work. While they were not subject to the same working conditions (with respect to the time spent in fuel tank entry and levels of chemical exposure) as those in the formal deseal/reseal programs, the Government acknowledges that other personnel, such as those undertaking ‘pick and patch’ work, may have also been adversely affected by their working conditions.</para>
<para class="block">Health care treatment and counselling, provided by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs under the SHOAMP Health Care Scheme, and health screening and testing under the Better Health Program, is now available for many more workers.  The Government Response also caters to the needs of family members of fuel tank maintenance workers, by extending counselling services available to workers and their families.  Both group and individual counselling sessions will be available - designed to meet the specific clinical needs of participants.  There will also be an increased number of sessions in the counselling program.</para>
<para class="block">To enable easier access to health care and compensation, the requirements for evidence to support claims have been broadened - through the development of guidelines enabling statutory declarations to be considered as part of formal evidence. This will facilitate the claims process for those whose official work-related records may be unavailable.</para>
<para class="block">The Department of Veterans’ Affairs will task a senior officer, with a health background, and a background knowledge of the F-111 worker claims, to oversee the implementation of this Response.  This officer’s role will also include monitoring and analysing the nature of health issues arising for current and future claims, so that trends in any late-emerging illnesses are identified. </para>
<para class="block">The Department of Defence is continuing to research the underlying cause of health conditions associated with F-111 fuel tank maintenance, through its study of mitochondria in personnel exposed to fuel and solvents.  A pilot study has now been completed and the next stage of the research is being scoped under the management of Defence Centre for Occupational Health. </para>
<para class="block">The ex-gratia payment scheme continues unchanged, with the exception that the Estates of deceased personnel who died prior to 8 September 2001 are now eligible to apply for ex-gratia payments.  The Government has elected not to extend eligibility for the ex-gratia payment scheme. </para>
<para class="block">In the interests of fairness, the scheme (although a flawed approach to a complex health and compensation issue) remains open to workers involved in the formal deseal/reseal work programs under the existing eligibility criteria.  The new guidelines for use of statutory declarations should assist more of the personnel involved in the formal deseal/reseal work programs to access the ex-gratia payments, where official records of their involvement are not available.</para>
<para class="block">As part of the Government Response, there is now a dedicated F-111 Government website, jointly hosted by the Departments of Defence and Veterans Affairs. The site provides information and assistance to F-111 fuel tank maintenance workers and their families, detailing the range of health services and compensation entitlements for affected workers, and the new eligibility requirements. The website is available at:</para>
<para class="block">http://f111.dva.gov.au</para>
<para class="block">The Government thanks the Committee responsible for conducting the Parliamentary Inquiry - for the breadth and scope of their work. We have considered the report in detail and are pleased to present this <inline font-style="italic">Government Response</inline>, outlining our approach and actions regarding the important matters raised on behalf of F-111 fuel tank maintenance workers and their families.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="10pt">At recommendations 3 – 6, the Inquiry Committee recommended the continuation and extension of an ex-gratia payment scheme instituted by the previous Government. This scheme attempted a simplistic lump sum payment solution to a complex health and compensation issue. The scheme did not make payments based upon need but based upon working conditions. As a consequence the majority of ex-gratia payments were made to personnel who were not suffering adverse health conditions. At the same time, other personnel suffering from similar health conditions were not able to access appropriate health care and compensation.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="10pt">The intention of the Inquiry Committee in extending ex-gratia payments to a broader work group was aimed at achieving equity. However, the Inquiry Committee was clearly faced with great difficulty in framing parameters for the broader work group. Unfortunately, the parameters selected by the Inquiry Committee suffer from many of the same difficulties as the original scheme. The majority of ex-gratia payments would be made to personnel not suffering from adverse health conditions. The Government recognises the challenge faced by the Inquiry Committee in seeking to achieve equity with ex-gratia payments made by the previous Government. However, the recommendation by the Inquiry Committee to continue and expand the scheme would continue an approach that is not based upon sound principles.</inline>
<inline font-size="10pt"> </inline>
<inline font-size="10pt"> In the interests of fairness, the ex-gratia payment scheme will remain open to the original workgroup of workers associated with the deseal/reseal formal programs.</inline>
<inline font-size="10pt"> </inline>
<inline font-size="10pt"> The approach to statutory declarations at recommendation two will also apply to Tiers 1 and 2 of the scheme and this may assist some workers associated with the deseal/reseal formal programs who were not successful in their previous ex-gratia payment applications due to the lack of official records.</inline>
<inline font-size="10pt"> </inline>
<inline font-size="10pt"> However, the scheme will not be expanded to a wider work group.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-size="10pt">The Government approach is based upon providing health care and compensation through the existing statutory mechanisms to those in need. Accordingly, the Government has taken an inclusive approach to recommendation 1 and 2 that exceeds the recommendations of the Inquiry Committee. This is a principled approach aimed at supporting those whose health has been affected through their service in the unique working environment of F-111 fuel tank maintenance.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Accordingly, the Government does not accept recommendations 3 – 6.</para>

<para class="block">These Bills provide for more generous tax benefits that are better targeted towards genuine research and development (R&amp;D) activities. Industry expressed concerns about the tightening of eligibility criteria in the exposure drafts of the legislation, and the effect on R&amp;D expenditure. In particular, industry was concerned about the new definitions of core R&amp;D and supporting R&amp;D. A range of views have been submitted in response to a consultation paper and two exposure drafts of the legislation, and the views taken into account in drafting the versions presented to the Committee.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I am very proud to stand here in support of this motion and in support of the evidence and the facts that we have on the table with respect to the waste and mismanagement that has been demonstrated by the Rudd Labor government over the last 2½, and a little bit more, years. It is not gross negligence; it is in fact worse—much worse. It is recklessness in the extreme. There has been a shocking amount of waste and mismanagement. In their time in office under Mr Rudd, Labor have wasted more than $4 billion of taxpayers’ money and they cannot be trusted with the public purse. Tuesday night’s budget delivery has confirmed what the coalition has been saying for months—that Australia cannot afford another three years of a Labor government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to reflect very briefly on the federal budget before reflecting on other evidence with respect to waste and mismanagement under the Rudd Labor government. Labor’s mismanagement of all the major policies over the last two years has left Australia with a massive budget deficit to the tune of nearly $41 billion. That is the largest budget deficit since World War II, bar one budget. It is the second largest in all those many decades. Last Tuesday night’s budget also confirmed our fears with respect to the collapsed Home Insulation Program, the pink batts fiasco, which will cost the Australian taxpayer $1 billion to fix. This additional spending is needed only because of Labor’s mismanagement and maladministration. Labor is now spending good money after bad on this program, and I will say more about that shortly.</para>
<para>Labor will have to borrow more than $700 million a week to fund its reckless and wasteful spending, continuing the upward pressure on interest rates and the cost of living for everyday mums and dads and Australian families. It is wrong, dead wrong. Labor, sneakily, has set aside $126-odd million dollars of taxpayers’ money in the budget to fund its advertising in the lead-up to the federal election. That is very sneaky indeed. It has slipped it into the federal budget, and it includes advertising on climate change. ‘This is the great moral issue of our time,’ says the Prime Minister, yet he has deferred the decision regarding the emissions trading scheme for some three years—and I notice Senator Wong in the chamber today. But they are willing to spend taxpayers’ money on advertising climate change and the government’s response to it. Where is the connection? It is absurd; it is a disgrace. Those are a few reflections on the budget.</para>
<para>But what do we say about the waste and mismanagement? I am going to list the shocking evidence that we have from the 2½ years or thereabouts under the Rudd Labor government. I am going to list the points and then I will speak to a few of them to hopefully gain the support of this chamber for this motion. We have had Building the Education Revolution, with a $1.5 billion blow-out, and the Home Insulation Program, with $1 billion wasted. There was a promise to cut consultancies but there have been $1.2 billion in contracts awarded. We have seen a $1 billion blow-out in laptops in schools, with barely half delivered. In terms of the environment, we have seen climate change advertising, with $50 million wasted, and $1.5 million wasted on the Copenhagen delegation. In terms of the ETS, 150 public servants are doing absolutely nothing for and on behalf of the Australian taxpayers, with $81.9 million wasted. There has been an $850 million blow-out on the solar panel rebate. The Green Loans scheme, a $175 million program, has been cancelled altogether. Of course, we have seen the UN Security Council bid of $35 million by the Rudd Labor government—and I know that is of relevance to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Trood. There was a promise of $4.7 billion for the National Broadband Network before the election and that was replaced with a $43 billion plan by the Rudd Labor government. Also, $20 million has been wasted on the broadband tender process and $25 million spent on paid consultants for the broadband business plan.</para>
<para>What about legal fees under the Rudd Labor government? They are at record levels of $550 million last year. The tax review cost $10 million but we have seen no action. We have seen $46 million wasted on tax bonus payments. Remember the money that went overseas and the money that went to dead people. That was a shocking waste of taxpayers’ money yet again. We saw $2 million wasted on the 2020 Summit. A sum of $45 million was spent on the Indigenous housing program before one house was completed. What a shocking waste of taxpayers’ money! Of the 260 childcare centres promised, 38 were delivered—and, of course, that has now been cancelled. Of the 35 GP superclinics promised, three are fully operational. The government had a plan to stop Japanese whaling. It was promised but not delivered. They are spending $1 million on a whale envoy. Of course, the cost of living has risen under Labor, and I will speak more about that very shortly. We have had the GROCERYchoice website, and what did they spend on that? Eight million dollars—not a bad website. And this is all because Mr Rudd promised before the last federal election that he wanted to get grocery prices down. But, of course, they have gone up and they have wasted $8 million on a website, which they themselves, through public pressure, coalition pressure and obvious common sense, have closed down. But they have wasted $8 million of taxpayers’ money. It is a disgrace. What about Fuelwatch? Prices went up, and this is another broken promise. Of course, you have seen the interest rates rise and rise and rise again.</para>
<para>What about some of the substantial pieces of evidence, whether with respect to the home insulation scheme, to Building the Education Revolution or to the cost of living? Let us have a look at some examples to convince the Labor senators in this place that they should support this motion and hang their heads in shame at this shocking waste of taxpayers’ money. The primary schools element of Building the Education Revolution blew out by $1.7 billion to $14.1 billion, and construction has barely begun. We saw in the budget papers that they are still going to be spending on schools four years after the global financial crisis, which kicked in in 2008. They will still be spending in 2012 in response to the global financial crisis. How absurd! Millions of dollars were wasted on signs and plaques promoting Labor policy and commemorating the Minister for Education, the Hon. Julia Gillard. Fancy spending all that money for that purpose!</para>
<para>Reports of waste and rorting began to emerge, but only after sustained pressure from the opposition, members of the public and people in the media did the government finally concede one example of rorting and waste. It took all that time. Dozens more followed, and here are some examples. In New South Wales, Hastings Public School’s shade project cost blew out from $400,000 to almost $1 million—for a shadecloth! There are plenty more examples on top of that. Tottenham Central School requested a new lab under the BER; instead they received a $600,000 eight-by-2.5-metre brick canteen—a canteen instead of a lab; a canteen without any cooking facilities and rendered ‘useless’ by the school. Marulan Public School in New South Wales received $853,000 for a new library that they did not want. The building is still not complete after being promised by early February. Inclusions such as heating, solar panels and covered walkways have been omitted. Estimates suggest that the structure that has been built could easily have been completed for around $350,000.</para>
<para>Senator Brett Mason asked an excellent question today of the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Carr, with respect to Rawlinsons, who are very credible and well-respected quantity surveyors. They did an assessment of the government’s Building the Education Revolution projects in terms of value for money. But do you think this government is interested in value for money? Clearly not, and the evidence confirms that. What did Rawlinsons say? They said that the way the government is approaching this is ‘insane and anomalous’. In terms of value for money, this government clearly is not interested. Its approach was to spend. Reckless spending is what it is doing.</para>

<para>I want to make a few comments with respect to cost of living. An excellent summary of this was set out in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on Thursday, 29 April. The headline is ‘Your bills soar as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd fails to keep costs down’, and the story says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">THE soaring cost of petrol, child care, housing, electricity and health is proof Kevin Rudd is failing to deliver on his election pledge to tackle the cost of living for working families.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister sought to make living costs a key election issue when he courted votes from “working families” and repeatedly attacked the Howard government for having “no solution”.</para>
<para>An analysis by the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>, based on the latest report card from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, reveals price increases in the past 12 months for utilities, child care and petrol alone have ripped $1000 from the yearly budget of a typical working family.</para>
<para>And the cost of housing (both rent and interest rates), hospital and medical charges, education and even haircuts eats up more of the budget than the cheaper price for clothing and computers. Grocery prices have been mixed.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In Victoria, as the story goes on to say, electricity has gone up 20 per cent; water and sewage, 17.6 per cent; gas, 7.5 per cent; petrol, 7.4 per cent; house purchase costs, 6.3 per cent; property rates and charges, 5.3 per cent—and the list goes on. In terms of the cost of living, this government has failed absolutely and abundantly. It is very sad.</para>
<para>In terms of the environment, the Green Loans Program has collapsed and has been cancelled, at a cost of $175 million. What has happened at the tax office? Senator Sherry is responsible for what happens at the tax office, and what happened was that tens of thousands of taxpayers were left out of pocket after tax assessment letters went out without cheques attached—that is, 140,000 letters will need to be resent, while the ATO continues to pay interest on overdue refunds. I commend shadow Assistant Treasurer Sussan Ley, who said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">After 3 months ignoring the problem this is yet another example of the Rudd Government’s delayed response in addressing problems that are affecting families and business across Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In terms of the environment again, a small-town Victorian football club was recently given 17 new hot water units, one for each player—how absurd!—under the Labor government’s hot water rebate scheme, which was intended for households only. The energy efficiency minister, Greg Combet, has been unable to explain how a sporting club benefited from the program. Koondrook footy club president Rod Barrington summed up the Labor government’s mismanagement perfectly when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">They just didn’t do any research about where it was going. It is taxpayers that pay for it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Too right they are paying for it! They are paying for it through the neck.</para>
<para>In terms of the pink batts fiasco, it has gone from bad to worse. It was confirmed in the budget that $1 billion of taxpayers’ money will be spent to remedy that program, to fix it up.</para>

<para>—What a farce it is, Senator Williams! It is a disgrace. Of course, there is no commitment by this government to inspect every one of the homes insulated under the program. So you have mums and dads, families, living in homes, anxious and in fear, not knowing exactly whether their homes are safe and secure. Under this program there have been 240,000 dodgy or unsafe installations, 1,500 electrified roofs, about 120 house fires—possibly more—and, tragically, four deaths. It is not good enough. There is a Senate inquiry, but the government should come clean and reveal all the information, including the letters between the Prime Minister and the minister for the environment.</para>

<name role="display">Senator CAMERON</name>
</talker>
<para>—Let me say at the outset of my contribution to the motion on taxpayer money that this government has nothing to hang its head in shame over. We are a government which tackled the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, we are a government which set about supporting 210,000 jobs in this economy and we are a government which, through the initiatives that we undertook, increased the level of GDP by three-quarters of one per cent. We are a government which has taken on the challenges, and we have done that with a number of initiatives to make sure that we have quality, adequacy and efficiency in our transport, communications, energy, education and health infrastructure systems. We have moved on higher education and we have moved on innovation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is where money has been spent, money that was not spent during 10½ years of the Howard government lying back and doing nothing, 10½ years of economic incompetence and 10½ years of lost opportunities. We have taken the steps to make sure that the schoolkids of this country have decent accommodation—something you did not care about. You did not care whether they could get out of the sun. You did not care whether they had a school hall. You did not care whether they had any language skills. You did not care whether they had any science labs. We do; Labor do. Labor want a decent society; we want a good society. We want a society in which everyone gets a fair go, not just the mining magnates that are pouring money into the coalition for its election purposes. We want a fair go for the children of this country, we want a fair go for the mums and dads and we want a fair go for communities both here and in the regions. We want a fairer society. We want a decent society. That is why, when faced with a $210 billion downward revision of taxation receipts as a result of the global recession, we decided to move. We decided to act decisively.</para>
<para>What did the opposition say? The opposition said: ‘We should wait and see. We should let the market rip. We should let workers lose their employment. We should let workers get put on the dole. We should let families suffer because we want the market to resolve this.’ We as a government knew the market would not resolve this. That is why we took the action that we did. We took action to ensure that working families were looked after and that working families had income immediately and jobs in the medium term. That is what we did. We supported the income of households through fiscal stimulus. We had shovel-ready infrastructure in place and we moved to create jobs. We had longer term nation-building projects that were absolutely essential to build a strong and productive economy for the future—something the Howard-Costello government never, ever did.</para>
<para>With this massive contraction in the world economy, with eight out of 10 of our trading partners contracting in 2009, we took that early and decisive action. We stimulated demand to make sure more Australians were in work. As I said, we invested in roads, rail, ports and broadband to boost productivity and growth because we understand the role of government—something that the coalition does not understand. The role of government is to step in and ensure that the economy continues when the market fails, yet we have a coalition that says, ‘Everything will be okay; we’ll sit back and we’ll wait to see what happens.’ We were not prepared to go down that path. We decided in the last budget to invest in roads, rail, ports, broadband and infrastructure, to invest in clean energy initiatives and to give first homeowners a fiscal hand-up. Many young homeowners would not have houses without that initiative of this government. We always had a deficit exit strategy in place.</para>
<para>In this budget, we have continued to invest in families through personal income tax cuts where a worker on $50,000 will be $450 better off. We have fairer and simpler tax returns. We are supporting banking competition to make the banking area more competitive, after-hours access to general practitioners, GP superclinics, training more doctors and allied health professionals and a COAG agreement on the National Health and Hospitals Network. We are also making sure we build for the future by giving ordinary working-class Australian kids an opportunity to get an apprenticeship—something that was never done under the Howard government.</para>
<para>Yet what do we get from those opposite? We get a scare campaign on behalf of their mates in the mining industry. The scare campaign is that the mining industry will be doomed under this government’s approach to making sure that they pay their fair share. You have to remember that the mining industry are making huge profits—$90 billion a year. Yet what the government gets back to invest in our schools and in our health system is minuscule. This lot on the other side want to make sure that the chief executive officer of Anglo American can pick up his $1.5 million a year and that we cannot make any improvements for our school kids. Anglo American’s profit is $511 million a year. It is our resources that we should be getting a return on.</para>
<para>BHP Billiton’s profit in 2008 was $15.39 billion. The chief executive gets $10.399 million a year—some people do not earn that in a lifetime and he gets that a year. This lot opposite have money coming into their election campaign to run their big scare campaign in support of the richest players in the country. They are arguing that we should not get back a fair share of the tax to provide for our infrastructure, for our schools, for our health and for our pensioners. We will not accept that position. Some of that $15.39 billion profit should come back to ordinary Australians.</para>
<para>At the peak of the boom in 2008, Rio Tinto earned $10.194 billion. Its chief executive officer is on a pay of $5.59 billion, no million—I nearly did a ‘Barnaby’ there, sorry. Xstrata’s profit at the peak of the boom was $7.249 billion and its chief executive earned $5.5 million. I want some of that money in our schools. I want some of that money in our education. I want some of that money in superannuation for ordinary Australians. That is what we stand for. That is what Labor stands for—not the scare tactics and scare campaigns of the lot on the other side. We stand for a fair and decent society—a society that can deliver for ordinary Australian families.</para>
<para>The richest men in Australia are running a campaign against this government. Why are they rich? They are rich because they have our resources. Forbes has Twiggy Forrest, CEO of Fortescue Metals, as being worth $5.7 billion on its list of richest Australians. One individual is worth $5.7 billion, yet those on the other side are running a scare campaign that none of that should come back to ordinary Australian families—that ordinary Australian families should not be living in dignity in retirement, that they should not get their superannuation lifted, that they should not get decent health services, that they should not get decent education and that you should let the market rip and let the billionaires in the mining industry stay as they are.</para>
<para>When you hear them argue for the mining industry, always remember Clive Palmer. He has had a meteoric rise since he was a property developer, and back when he pushed Joh Bjelke-Petersen for Canberra. That was his start. He has handed $850,000 in funding to the coalition. Why would they not be standing up there denying children decent schools? Why would they not be standing up there denying decent roads to the community? Why would they not be standing up there doing what they are doing—that is, continuing an unfair tax system in this country? They are playing up to their paymasters—the mining companies that are pouring money into the coalition to try and stop this tax, and to try and keep their unfair position in this country. That is not a position that we are prepared to tolerate.</para>
<para>Let us go back to some reality in relation to this country’s finances. I ask any of the speakers who are going to follow me to look at the budget papers and to look at chart 1 in Budget Paper No. 1. That shows that we will be the only country with a positive GDP in three years time. Germany, Canada, Italy, France, Japan, the UK and the US will be nowhere near our fiscal position. Our debt is the lowest amongst advanced countries, and as a percentage of GDP we are the envy of the world. Let me tell you what the experts say—not what is said by Senator Barnett or Senator Joyce, the failed shadow minister, not them—the people who understand how the economy works. What did Governor Stevens say on 1 March at the ASIC summer school in 2010? He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We can come out of this episode as the country that didn’t have to buy their banks, where government finances are in terrific shape, where the ... debt ratio will peak at 10 per cent of GDP, with a strong regulatory framework, didn’t have to do very unconventional monetary and fiscal measures, the regular measures applied liberally worked, worked a treat actually ... how many other countries are on that list?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There are issues when you move to intervene to help ordinary workers. You do have problems from time to time. But what does the Governor of the Reserve Bank have to say? The governor says that our finances are in ‘terrific shape’, that we are the envy of the rest of the world.</para>
<para>What does Kyran Curry, from the credit rating agency Standard and Poor’s have to say? He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The deficits and additional borrowings do not alter the sound profile of Australia’s public finances, which remain among the strongest of its peer group.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I have more that I could go on with. But just let me contrast our position of fiscal responsibility—of economic responsibility, of looking after ordinary Australians—with the rabble that are the opposition. How many shadow finance ministers have they had in the last period of time? Peter Dutton, member for Dickson: gone. Joe Hockey, member for North Sydney: gone. Senator Helen Coonan: sacked to put in Senator Barnaby Joyce. What an absolute joke. And now Senator Barnaby Joyce has been sacked because he is so incompetent and we now have Andrew Robb. What a rabble this lot are. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—‘Monstrous profits’, he called out. Who owns them? I asked that question of an accountant, a financial adviser, a couple of days ago and he said 10 to 20 per cent of the ownership of those companies is in superannuation funds—the $1.3 trillion superannuation funds of the workers, those very people that you are supposed to represent. They are the investors, the owners of such mining companies. But that word ‘profit’ is a dirty word over there in the Labor Party. They would much rather see businesses not make a profit.

<para>—and Senator Cameron perhaps might even consider listening—of these great investments by the Labor government, which just happened to fail. Let’s start with Fuelwatch: $21 million. There is silence on the other side, Madam Acting Deputy President. They might as well have thrown it in the gutter. What is the result of Fuelwatch today? It is a waste of $21 million of taxpayers’ money—or borrowed money—that will have to be paid back.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The National Broadband Network has gone from $4 billion, to $7 billion, to $43 billion and is to cost about $20,000 a connection. Where is the money coming from? We can see from the $25 million report on the National Broadband Network that it is not going to return a dividend; it is not going to attract private investment. It will have to be borrowed money that sets up and establishes it.</para>
<para>We will move on to GroceryWatch: $13 million. This was how Mr Rudd was going to put downward pressure on grocery prices. One of his many promises prior to the 2007 election was, ‘I will put downward pressure on grocery prices.’ So he introduced GroceryWatch, at a cost of $13 million. It is just like Fuelwatch: he might as well have thrown it in the gutter. It did not do any good; it was simply a waste of money.</para>
<para>Of course I will talk about the school infrastructure program, Building the Education Revolution—or the ‘builders’ early retirement’ scheme, as we should refer to it. And then there are refugees. How many boats have we had so far? Mr Rudd said prior to the election of 2007, ‘I will turn the boats back.’ What a great statement. Now, in this week’s budget, we find an extra billion dollars from taxpayers—sorry, put on the credit card that future Australians will have to pay for—to control the asylum seekers and the cost of them.</para>
<para>I am sure Senator Humphries, who is in the chamber, will remember the 2020 Summit—1,000 minds, 1,000 bed and breakfasts and a $2 million-plus program for nine usable ideas. I suppose that is nine more than the Labor Party would have had, anyway.</para>
<para>Then there is the ‘batts-in batts-out’ program, the $2.6 billion stimulus package to insulate houses. This is a very serious issue. I feel so sorry for those relatives and loved ones of the four men who lost their lives. It is darn lucky that more people have not lost their lives, when more than 100 houses have burnt down. Now we see in the budget almost $1 billion to clean up the mess. Is that money well spent? It is money wasted.</para>
<para>And when we talk about money wasted we should talk about the $42 billion ‘cash splash 2’: $900 to most Australians—all those on less than $80,000 gross income—to stimulate the economy. I am sure China would have been very grateful for that $900 handout spent on the new televisions and electronic items that we import from there. We do not make any in Australia these days, of course—or, if we do, it would be very few. I am glad my daughter used her $900 dollars wisely to stimulate the economy. She paid off her credit card with it, which was the way she saw to stimulate the economy. She said, ‘What a waste of money.’</para>
<para>We will move along to further programs. The GP superclinics: $275 million. How many of those do we have in action? I think there are two—or is it three?—completed GP superclinics. Health is a major issue. The money should be spent wisely and we should get a decent return.</para>
<para>The Rudd government was going to reduce consultancies by $112 million. Instead, what do we have? An increase to $800 million—6,354 consultancies. There is a blowout of almost $700 million.</para>
<para>It gets better. There is digital TV from Senator Conroy. In 2008 he was going to slash $22 million from the cost of the changeover. The original estimate was $16 million. It is now to cost $66 million. It goes on and on and on.</para>
<para>Let me look again at the Building the Education Revolution. I have had some people come to me, but I will not name them because they do not want to be publicised. They are in the education department and fear the repercussions of being named. A local builder quoted $78,000 for a covered outdoor learning area, which included the footpaths, but the government contractor came along and charged $228,000 excluding the footpaths—basically, four times the price.</para>
<para>Dr David Gillespie, the Nationals candidate for Lyne, is still amazed that Hastings Public School at Port Macquarie had a shade project blow out from $400,000 to almost $1 million, and the education minister only intervened after the media blew the whistle. I do not know why the local member did not raise the issue.</para>
<para>At Manilla Central School near Tamworth in New England, up where I live, they have two demountable classrooms off the back of a truck. That is two demountables for $1.8 million! Again, it was Senator Joyce on a television program who highlighted this waste, and again the local Independent member was asleep at the wheel. Think about building a house. Three hundred thousand dollars would build you a good brick home. So for $1.8 million you could expect to build six really good brick veneer homes. What do they do? They get two demountable classrooms. That is far from equivalent to six brick veneer homes.</para>
<para>The education minister was in denial. She thought this program was fantastic. But now she is not sure and is spending another $14 million to find out. Senator Mason and I, through the Senate, asked the Auditor-General to address a question of value for money. But his report, released last week, did not answer any questions. No doubt we will be asking more. No doubt the inquiry in the New South Wales parliament—in the Legislative Council—will release the information about the waste in this whole Building the Education Revolution.</para>
<para>I will give you another example. A school in the New England area had a barbed wire fence. The top wire of the fence around the school was made of barbed wire. Along came the experts in the Building the Education Revolution and they said, ‘That fence has to come down.’ It cost $32,000 to replace it with a new fence. The cocky next door took the barbed wire off and put a plain wire on, and $900 later the job was complete. There is a saving of more than $31,000. But, to remove the barbed wire, they had said, ‘No, we’ve gotta pull the whole fence down.’ This is a very small school I might add.</para>
<para>I will tell you about another school in western New South Wales. We talk about spending money for value—and we might get a reaction from the other side here. I know of a school in western New South Wales that got a new classroom for around $225,000. You might say: ‘That is a great investment. Schools need classrooms.’ But this school has a student total of three. You have three students in the whole school, and they put in a new classroom! How many classrooms do you need in a school with three students?</para>

<para>What annoys me so much is that when I visit places like St Annes Nursing Home up in Broken Hill I find that they do not have enough money to expand their buildings to provide more facilities. They are a really good organisation, and Broken Hill has many people in that age bracket where they are needing care and will need care in the very near future. But we see a new classroom going into a school in western New South Wales that has a total school attendance of just three. So much for the neglect of our aged care and so much for the waste in this program.</para>
<para>Let us move on to the climate change and the ETS. Let us talk about climate change. It is ‘the greatest moral challenge of our age’, but the Prime Minister puts it off until 2013 and blames the opposition for it. The Copenhagen junket in December last year cost $1.5 million, with the Prime Minister and his entourage, and for what result? Nothing. They virtually told the Prime Minister to go away. Yet he is spending millions and millions of dollars advertising to raise awareness of climate change.</para>
<para>Back to the broadband issue. Labor promised broadband $4.7 billion and spent $20 million on a cancelled tender process and another $25 million on consultants to work out if it was viable. The end result is the $43 billion project. But we know who the seven per cent who miss out will be. They will be from regional areas—around one and a half million people.</para>
<para>What about the home insulation program? The government was warned there were problems with this program, but the Prime Minister put his hands over his ears and ordered his environment minister to roll out the program. It was payday for the crooks and conmen out there. It cost $1 billion to fix the home insulation debacle. There were 240,000 dodgy or unsafe installations, 1,500 electrified roofs, 120 house fires and four deaths. That $1 billion could have built 32 cancer clinics. It is $1 billion wasted—not of taxpayers’ money but of borrowed money—that could have built 32 cancer clinics.</para>
<para>And what has happened to those businesses who took the Prime Minister at his word? They ordered in the batts and put on workers and then had the rug pulled out from underneath them. Many legitimate businesses are still owed thousands of dollars by the Rudd government for work done before the program was closed on 19 February. This would have to be the biggest waste of any government program in Australia’s history, and the ‘economic conservative’ is presiding over it.</para>
<para>I want to go on to talk about the buyback of water. The Kahlbetzer family was paid $303 million to buy back their water licences. Two of the rivers—the Gwydir and the Lachlan—do not even run into the Murray. The Gwydir empties out into the Gwydir wetlands. In a once-in-100-years flood, the Lachlan may get to the Murrumbidgee, but it is unlikely. Then we have the Macquarie River going through Dubbo, where a licence was bought back, and it runs out into the Macquarie Marshes. But the Kahlbetzer family said, ‘You buy all or none.’ That is $303 million to let more water go down the Murray, and three of the rivers do not even run into the Murray. The wasteful spending that we are seeing in this whole program is outrageous.</para>
<para>When you look back at the Whitlam era, and the borrowing and waste, this government today makes the Whitlam government look conservative. The wasteful and reckless spending will cause interest rates to rise. That is a big thing about this whole program—the borrowing of money. We had a debt of—what? A couple of days ago it was $140 billion of gross debt. That will run at about $150 billion before the end of this financial year. Add another $41 billion onto that, and that is $191 billion by 30 June 2011. Add another $13 billion after that, and we are looking at about $204 billion gross debt. Even in two years time, that is $6.5 billion to pay the interest alone. Imagine what $6.5 billion could do. We realise there is a global financial crisis and we realise that you need some stimulation, but—</para>

<para>Now we have had six interest rate rises in the last eight months and more to come. My home loan has gone from a start of 4.99 per cent to now almost seven per cent and I know there are a lot more to come because you are simply releasing the fiscal handbrake and the Reserve Bank will have to pull harder on the other handbrake for interest rates. Those who will suffer will be the battlers, the ordinary families paying for their homes, the people in small business, the farmers who have suffered drought—in many areas since 2002. They are the ones who will suffer most. The waste of these programs has just been humungous. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is very interesting in this budget week that, rather than having any constructive response to a very well put together budget by the Treasurer, Mr Swan, and the Labor Party, the opposition goes back to its old mantra that it has been trying to push for so long now and moves the motion: ‘That the Senate notes the Rudd Labor Government’s waste and mismanagement of taxpayer money.’</para>

<para>The opposition have come in here and said that we should have done more in the time we have been in government. I am standing here looking at page 26 of today’s <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, which has nearly three pages of bills discharged or negatived because of the current opposition not allowing the Rudd Labor government to get on with the job, to fulfil its programs and to work efficiently in the best interests of the Australian public. The opposition come in here time after time with their negative comments and their negative votes without putting forward any alternative. The opposition have not put through revenue measures from the last budget and have not allowed us to proceed with well-structured programs that would allow benefits to the Australian people. Indeed, they have signalled that they will do that again with this budget. I do not know what we will hear from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, this evening in his budget-in-reply speech. We are all hoping that we might hear something substantial rather than the ‘No, we will not pass the resource rent tax; no, we will not pass this and we will not pass that’ because they are bereft of any ideas. Of course, it is perfectly easy to criticise programs and we heard Senator Williams address the Building the Education Revolution Program and the Home Insulation Program, which were part of the government’s stimulus package. I have been to two openings of BER schools.</para>

<para>—Senator Williams has not been to any. I feel very sorry for him. If he had he might not have come into the chamber, like he has, and criticised them. Anyone who has been to one of those openings has been overwhelmed by the appreciation of the school and the community for the facilities they have been given as part of that program. The two schools I have been to have been in rural South Australia, and they each made the point that, in a small community, it is very hard—very difficult indeed—to raise funds for this kind of capital expenditure. They are very grateful to the government, as building these facilities means that they can now concentrate their fees and their fundraising on improving resources for their students, improving curriculum and doing the other things that schools need to do, rather than saving their money for capital expenditure or making do with substandard facilities.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I know as a former member of a state parliament where the state government had responsibility for the upkeep of those resources how difficult it was to put money aside for that sort of essential maintenance and renewal of school facilities. Too many schools, particularly schools in rural and regional areas, had substandard facilities. This program under this government has set about addressing the problem—and has set about addressing it in a climate of global financial crisis.</para>
<para>The Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, has put in place an auditing program through the implementation task force, which ensures that the taxpayers of Australia are getting full value for money. The terms of reference for this task force are comprehensive and will ensure that, where there have been problems and where there has been outright rorting of the system, that will be pursued vigorously. There is also the opportunity for that program to be stopped if that is found to be the case. So rather than allowing a regional rorts type program to proceed, as under the Howard government, the minister and the Rudd government have acted quickly to ensure that, if there is any problem with the program, it is stopped and stopped now.</para>
<para>Similarly with the insulation program, part of the stimulus program, once the problems were identified—and unfortunately it cost the lives of four young men, and that is tragic—the Rudd government moved in to stem the results of that loss and redress the problems of householders who received the grant under that insulation program. Many of those households, of course, have got perfectly good insulation. They are very happy with it and it is performing the job that it is required to do. But there are households—and we do not yet know how many—where there are problems with either the installation or the safety of that installation. The government has put in place programs to ensure that those problems are redressed, and most certainly that it does not happen again. Furthermore, not content with that, the government has put in place programs to make sure that the workers in that industry are not simply abandoned, that there are programs in place that they can access to make sure that they have the best chance of getting another job—to keep intact the aims of the government’s financial stimulus package.</para>
<para>Senator Williams said, ‘Why didn’t we leave this to growth through the private sector? Why put in a government stimulus?’ Because it works, Senator Williams. That is why it was done. It was done because the private sector was pulling back on their investment. It was well documented that business investment was pulling back, particularly from small to medium businesses. They were not prepared to take the risk, given the global financial situation. In order to stop massive unemployment and in order to stop a decline in confidence in the economy and a spiralling downturn, the government stepped in and performed the role that the private sector was not going to perform. Rather than having the battlers suffer—as Senator Williams said—we have put in place programs to ensure that there will be far fewer battlers than there would have been if the Howard government had stayed in place.</para>
<para>I am astonished at the hubris of the opposition to come in and complain about waste and mismanagement and a lack of activity by the Rudd government. Clearly, it is a case of people in glasshouses should not throw stones. They make themselves far too easy a target. But the Rudd government is not, I have to say, spending too much time with the opposition here; the Rudd government is getting on with the task that it was elected to do—that is, to build Australia’s future. Despite the negativity and the willingness of the opposition to vote against any piece of legislation that is brought into this place, the Rudd government has still had a number of sterling achievements in the last couple of years. Apart from dealing very decisively and officially with the global financial crisis, the Rudd government has funded 1,000 new nurse training places; supported record investment in solar and wind power; very critically, abolished Work Choices; helped to secure our water supplies by buying back water licences from the oversubscribed water of all rivers—not just the Murray-Darling Basin—and therefore helped the health of the Murray-Darling Basin; invested in new cancer research and treatment centres; funded increases in GP training; and worked very hard in general in education and skills development.</para>
<para>I thank the opposition for giving us this opportunity to stand up and run through the achievements of the Rudd government and contrast them with the appalling record of the previous Howard government.</para>

<para>—There is a song of which the refrain comes to mind, ‘If it feels good, do it’, but in the case of the Rudd government it is more like, ‘If it sounds good, let’s promise it and keep promising it for as long as we can get away with having it sound good. And when it comes to D-Day’—that is, delivery day—‘we will break our promise or, if we proceed to try and deliver, then we will mismanage and the botch the delivery and create nothing other than waste in the process.’</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If it sounds good, promise it. ‘If it sounds good, we will promise Fuelwatch.’ It sounded good, all right. Did it do any good? No. ‘GROCERYchoice sounds good, so we’ll promise it.’ Did it do any good? No. ‘Computers for every school kid: sounds good; let’s promise it.’ Did it do any good? No. ‘The Building the Education Revolution: sounds good, so we’ll promise it.’ Has it delivered value for money? No. And that is the least of it. ‘The Home Insulation Program—stimulating the economy, creating jobs and protecting the environment: sounds good; let’s promise it.’</para>
<para>In this process the Rudd government has turned its back on the most fundamental of its promises that could have helped it to deliver some good from what sounded good. That most fundamental promise, given by the Prime Minister himself, was evidence based policy. With any of these promises, had the government bothered to keep that promise—to actually do a cost-benefit analysis, to map the problem that they were trying to fix or the good that they were trying to do and show that their policy was going to achieve it—then they might have avoided the waste and mismanagement that is tragically unfolding with broken promises and botched delivery daily.</para>
<para>The Home Insulation Program: sounds good—stimulate the economy, create jobs and help the environment. There was no evidence base for the Home Insulation Program. It was characterised instead by haste to get the money out the door at all costs—pun intended. The top priority was to get the money out the door; little else mattered. Those were the writing instructions. That is the evidence behind the scenes that we would get, if we could get it, through the Senate committee process attempting to do its best to show the Australian people what they deserve to know about the management of the Home Insulation Program.</para>
<para>The Rudd government promised that the Home Insulation Program would stimulate the economy—we were told at the time. It is a broken promise, particularly with the budget, because we now see that all the Home Insulation Program is going to do is realise the warnings that the government got in its own independent risk analysis from Minter Ellison. More than a year or so prior to today, and certainly months in advance of rolling out the program, the Minter Ellison risk assessment foretold that if the risks identified in that assessment were not addressed, then there was every prospect that the program would cost more than any money it was ever going to bring into the economy. Sadly, that is exactly what is now set to happen with the home insulation debacle, as most recently proved by the budget delivered by the Treasurer this week.</para>
<para>All that the Home Insulation Program is going to do is break the first plank of what the program was supposed to do and which sounded good: stimulate the economy. No, it is going to back money out of the economy. Create jobs? Please, tell that to the Australians who came to the industry at the behest of the government. They answered the government’s call yet many of these workers had their jobs destroyed overnight by the stroke of a ministerial pen when Minister Garrett first suspended and then scrapped the Home Insulation Program—not that I am suggesting that that was not the right thing to do. It was just after too many months, too many millions and too much waste—too late.</para>
<para>The third plank of the Home Insulation Program was to supposedly help the environment. How can a program help the environment when it has not been evidentially assessed and when the wrong insulation is put in the wrong sorts of houses in the wrong places for the wrong sorts of climates? How can a home insulation program help the environment when in tropical Queensland, insulation is laid underneath corrugated iron roofs, which naturally attract condensation due to the tropical climate? How can that insulation help the environment when it collects moisture and risks not just the insulation becoming mouldy but also ceiling collapse? How can the wrong insulation in the wrong sorts of houses in the wrong sorts of climates help the environment?</para>
<para>How can the Home Insulation Program help the environment when everybody other than the government seems to be saying that every home that has had insulation laid under this program must at the very least be inspected? There will be quite a few damn carbon miles created in inspecting all that has been laid. What to do once it has been inspected? There are electrical risks waiting to be realised. There is dangerous and dodgy insulation waiting to be realised. What to do then? It is not so simple as to rip out the foil insulation, for example. There is evidence to the Senate inquiries into the Home Insulation Program that much of the insulation that has been laid is not biodegradable. What about the environment in that?</para>
<para>What is to be done if insulation—for example, foil—is ripped out and the electrically risky staples remain, which the electrical experts say still leaves electrocution waiting to happen who knows when? What to do about that mismanagement and the waste that comes therefrom? The Home Insulation Program sounded good but did no good at all. Indeed, it has created—I am sure unintentionally, but it is so nonetheless—tragedy and destruction rather than construction of anything good.</para>
<para>Round 1 of the National Broadband Network sounded good in its promise to connect some 98 per cent of Australians at a cost to the taxpayer of some $4.7 billion. The $4.7 billion debt, of course, did not sound very good to the Australian public, but some 18 months after the making of that sound-good promise, and some $30 million of taxpayer expenditure on that promise later, the government decided to up the ante with something that sounded even better. So it broke the NBN round 1 promise and made the NBN round 2 promise. In making the NBN round 2 promise, the government is now telling us that it will spend up to $43 billion of taxpayers’ money to connect some 90 per cent, maybe, of Australians to a fibre-to-the-home network. It sounds good, but look at the government’s track record on promises broken thus far and botched delivery and look at the clues as to why. The clues, as I have said, are no cost-benefit analysis and no delivery on the promise of evidence based policy.</para>
<para>With the National Broadband Network round 2, Minister Conroy suggests all will have been revealed by now in his implementation study, which he has belatedly released. All that the implementation study, that $25 million taxpayer spend for some 500 pages—and we do not want to contemplate how much taxpayer money has been spent per page on that diatribe—</para>

<para>—You can work it out. All that the implementation study tells us is that it is a very optimistic forecast of what the National Broadband Network will cost. Yet there is still no mapping and no empirical analysis of the benefit of this sounds-good National Broadband Network.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>But, if you dare to question the National Broadband Network, you are branded, just as you were branded a climate change sceptic when you dared to question the Prime Minister’s solutions to so-called climate change. If you dare to question the National Broadband Network, you are branded as a National Broadband Network sceptic. Why should you not be so when thus far the only thing that we have seen from the government is the $25 million taxpayer funded implementation study, which is very robust when it comes to how much this thing is going to cost but very light on telling us the benefits?</para>
<para>The implementation study projects take-up rates of between 70 and 90 per cent, so it is suggesting that between 70 and 90 per cent of Australians will take up fibre to the home. For example, it suggests that if 70 per cent of Australians take up the National Broadband Network and there is a small blow-out in costs then the profit—I wonder if it is super profit; no, of course not, because this is NBN Co.—will be in the range of some three to five per cent. The study then goes on to say that if 80 per cent of Australians take up fibre to the home and there is no blow-out in costs then NBN Co. will realise some six to seven per cent in profit. Then it goes even further and suggests that if 90 per cent of Australians take up the National Broadband Network and costs come in—yes, you have guessed it—slightly below par, slightly below what is predicted, then NBN Co. will make a profit of some eight or nine per cent, which of course is not a super profit in the mind of the Rudd government, because after all this is a government that clearly has two standards. This is an implementation study that is very conservative on the cost and totally light on when it comes to benefits.</para>
<para>If you look at the broken promises and the botched delivery of this government thus far, Australians are entitled to question what is looking set to happen with the second round of the National Broadband Network. Let us not forget that today, finally, this government has fessed up. Yes, it is going to break its promise made to the Australian business community, supposedly, about the Do Not Call Register. It sounded good to promise the business community that they would not be bothered anymore if they did not want to be by unsolicited business calls, but the government forgot to do what it promised to do, which was to deliver evidence based policy with a Do Not Call Register. It did not map who was going to benefit from the bill and it did not map at what cost that bill would come. So they waltz into parliament this week needing coalition support to deliver their breaking of their promise but more importantly to deliver ongoing registration for households that want to continue on the Do Not Call Register.</para>
<para>All that waste could have been avoided. The Australian public is entitled to continue to ask the Rudd government what it is going to deliver in terms of the National Broadband Network, how it is going to deliver it, when it is going to deliver it and what they are going to have to pay to enjoy the benefits. They are all the more entitled to ask that when you look at the Rudd government’s record of broken promises, botched delivery, waste and mismanagement.</para>

<para>—As Napoleon said, ‘Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake’—or perhaps, as Senator Birmingham may take note of, never argue with the guy with the microphone. I can assure them that my colleagues over here and I are enjoying the opportunity to work up some campaigning material for the months ahead.</para>

<para>Today we are being accused of wasting taxpayers’ money. I said yesterday that the motion introduced by the opposition, accusing the Rudd government of reckless spending, required cheek of a very high order. Today’s motion goes even further: it is positively reckless. For the Liberal and National parties to raise the issue of wasteful use of taxpayers’ money in this Senate shows a truly reckless disregard for their own political safety. We knew that they would abandon the truth, but now they have abandoned caution as well. Senators opposite seem to think that they can come into the Senate and berate us for allegedly wasting taxpayers’ money, without anyone pointing to the monumental hypocrisy that this charge entails, coming as it does from the most shameless misusers of public money in the history of Australian politics—and that is indeed saying something. They must have very short memories; they must imagine that we all have the memories of goldfish and they must assume that the electorate does too.</para>
<para>Fortunately for the forces of truth and virtue, however, I have a very long memory, and I also have a big fat file on the record of the Liberal and National parties misusing taxpayers’ money. It is now my privilege to share with the Senate some of the contents of that file. Perhaps fortunately for those opposite, the time available to me will not allow me to go through every example of their gross waste of taxpayers’ money. The rest will, however, keep for another occasion.</para>
<para>The first item from this file is the report of the inquiry held by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Reference Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Regional partnerships and sustainable regions programs</inline> and dated 6 October 2005. This was the notorious ‘regional rorts’ program, as it came to be popularly known—a program which the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government referred to in such a timely way in question time in the House of Representatives just today.</para>
<para>What did that committee inquiry find? It found:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In six case studies involving grants in excess of $15.5 million, the Committee uncovered major deficiencies … “In these projects the Committee found common problems—funding criteria were bypassed, the department and area consultative committees were cut out of the picture and ministers and their advisers intervened to fast track the approval of select projects at the expense of due process” …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There you have it—but the story continues. It is very clear from the committee’s report that the Regional Partnerships program was used by ministers in the Howard government as a way to channel taxpayers’ money to their own marginal electorates. The clinching proof of this dire allegation is that the committee found that over half of the grant approvals, amounting to over $70 million in funding, occurred in the three months leading to the federal election of 2004. Fancy that! They were timed so that coalition members and candidates could announce these projects just before or during the election campaign—what a coincidence!—and then, of course, take credit for them. They were, in other words, a blatant exercise in vote buying. These are the people who now come into this place and seek to lecture us about the misuse of taxpayers’ money.</para>
<para>Let me give some striking examples of this magnificent program. The Beaudesert Rail project was the recipient of four grants totalling $5.7 million, including a $600,000 grant under the Regional Partnerships program. Beaudesert was, of course, in the marginal Liberal electorate of Forde, and the committee concluded that the $600,000 Regional Partnerships grant to Beaudesert Rail approved in November 2003 was made for political purposes. The committee said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Documents provided in evidence to the Committee reveal that in the final days leading up to the government decision on BR the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson MP, who was also the portfolio minister for RPP, was involved in discussions with the Prime Minister’s office about the matter of government assistance.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Next we have the notorious Tumbi Creek dredging project—and, I must confess, it is one of my personal favourites. Surely senators opposite remember Tumbi Creek. They might have recalled this matter before they came into the Senate and tried to raise the issue of misusing of taxpayers’ money. Let me remind them that two grants totalling $1.5 million to Wyong Shire Council for dredging work at the mouth of Tumbi Creek were approved by the National Party parliamentary secretary De-Anne Kelly in mid 2004. Tumbi Creek happened to be in what was then the marginal Liberal seat of Dobell. It has of course since been liberated from the forces of darkness and evil and is held by Mr Craig Thomson.</para>
<para>The committee found that there was ‘a high degree of political collaboration’ involving ministerial advisers and the federal member’s office in relation to this project. In one instance a ministerial adviser countermanded departmental advice. This meant that, even though the dredging project was actually ineligible to receive funding because it did not have the relevant state licence, the grant announcement could still be made by the Prime Minister just days before the 2004 federal election was announced. Fancy that!</para>
<para>If I had the time, I would offer the Senate some more fine examples that were set out in the Senate committee’s report on the Regional Partnerships program—more examples of the gross and deliberate waste of taxpayers’ money by the previous government. Alas, if I did that, I would not have time to remind the Senate of an even bigger abuse of public funds by the government to which senators opposite belonged. I am referring, of course, to the huge amount of money spent by the Howard government on government advertising.</para>
<para>During the 11 years of the Howard government, something in the order of $1 billion was spent on government advertising—a truly extraordinary sum, and there was not even a pink batt to show for it. The biggest ticket items in the Howard government’s advertising budget were blatantly political campaigns designed to further the government’s agenda. There is no person active in politics in this country who would doubt for a single moment that those campaigns were tasked with anything other than the re-election of the government that paid for them.</para>
<para>The campaign to promote the GST cost something in the order of $400 million. This was a campaign launched before the relevant legislation had been passed by the Senate—that is to say, the coalition government launched the television campaign to support their policies before they even bothered putting the legislation into the parliament. This was not a legitimate advertising campaign designed to explain a new tax system to the taxpayers. It was a political campaign designed to put pressure on this Senate to pass the legislation, to persuade the electorate at large that that legislation was desirable and to do that before even legislators had had the opportunity to consider it. It was a campaign that met all of the tests of an outrage.</para>
<para>The other big-ticket item on the Howard government’s advertising bill was the campaign to promote the Work Choices legislation, a campaign that cost taxpayers well over $120 million and which was one of the most blatantly political campaigns ever seen in this country. It is true to say that it was a terribly unsuccessful campaign. It is true to say that the coalition government’s campaign to sell Work Choices was a complete and miserable failure. It proves that old advertising adage that nothing kills a poor product like good advertising. Notwithstanding the abject failure of that campaign, the intent and the reasoning that gave rise to it make it clear that it was one of the most blatantly political campaigns ever seen in this country. Australian working families were forced to watch their own taxes being used to pay for advertisements telling them that they would be better off under an industrial relations system that stripped away nearly all of their workplace rights. Most importantly, of course, they could see through its transparent political agenda.</para>
<para>Today’s motion seeks to criticise the Rudd government for wasteful misuse of taxpayers’ money. It comes from senators who were themselves part of a government that was guilty of massive and systemic misuse of taxpayers’ money. They wasted taxpayers’ money on middle-class welfare, showering money on their own supporters at every budget and during every election campaign. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper famously calculated that, in his 2004 election announcement, former Prime Minister John Howard spent $94 million a minute—an extent of largesse and an orgy of pork-barrelling that even appalled their friends at the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper.</para>
<para>Those opposite are not strangers to misuse of taxpayers’ moneys. Even some of the Howard government’s strongest supporters became queasy about the reckless spending of the Howard government. In December 2006 Greg Lindsay, Barry Maley and Peter Saunders from the Centre For Independent Studies, a conservative think tank—which, I might wryly remark, was neither independent nor guilty of much study—wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> about their concerns at the Howard government’s wasteful spending:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We are among those who have expressed concern about the federal Government’s family policies …</para>
<para class="block">We were appalled by the $3000-per-child cash handouts showered on parents at the time of the last election, and we are increasingly convinced that the Government’s new family relationship centres are a waste of money.</para>
<para class="block">                …            …            …</para>
<para class="block">The Howard Government is spending record sums of taxpayers’ money providing for families who could provide for themselves if only it taxed them less.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Earlier in the article, they also stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Families are losing their financial independence as they become habituated to receiving handouts from Canberra.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This motion today is a masterpiece of hypocrisy. It comes from a coalition which has no credibility when it comes to the subject of wasteful spending and whose leaders were members of the cabinet that presided over some of the most wilful and exposed rorting of the public purse of any government in Australian history. No-one who has had the patience to listen to this debate would be fooled by this motion.</para>
<para>Let us remember that the stimulus package and the expenditure of the Rudd Labor government were designed to fulfil an important macroeconomic task. That macroeconomic task was the preservation of our economy in a period of unprecedented turbulence. The global financial crisis raised the very real spectre of a global recession and even, some feared, a global depression. It was in those circumstances that the Rudd government acted boldly and decisively. It introduced a stimulus package which saved the Australian economy. A technical recession was avoided and the Australian economy is now the envy of the world. This was the great macroeconomic task that our expenditure was aimed at.</para>
<para>Those opposite might whinge and wail about some of the implementation of some of the smaller parts of that stimulus package, but let us remember that the stimulus package was conceived by a government concerned for the national good. Compare and contrast that to the behaviour of those opposite, because these abuses of taxpayers’ money that I have cited here today were not conceived in the national interest. They were not part of a broader program aimed to preserve and protect Australian jobs. They were not part of a program to bring about better government in this country. They were not conceived by politicians anxious to protect Australians from a global financial crisis. No, their atrocities were nothing more than the small-minded plotting of politicians desperate to protect and preserve their own election. The opposition come into this place with such a miserable record and seek to berate this government, when in fact what they should be doing is looking at their own record and the fact that not only have their own abuses of the public purse been dramatically exposed but the reasoning that gave rise to them was utterly bereft of anything other than a greed for power.</para>

<para>—Last night Australians tuned into the ABC <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> with Kerry O’Brien and were staggered by Prime Minister Rudd’s behaviour. It reminded us all here in the chamber of the appalling mistake that the Labor Party made when they chose Mark Latham to be their leader. It was only due to the total rejection by Australians of that choice that the Labor caucus dumped him. After last night’s gripping performance—about which we have heard and seen a lot of editorial comment today—I can only ask: can the real Kevin Rudd please stand up? No matter how much he would like us to believe that he is a calm, conciliatory, approachable family man, those who have the misfortune to be close to him in the political arena seem to know otherwise. Air stewards, restaurant owners and waiters in Melbourne and even Labor caucus members, along with many former staffers, know only too well that this man is a fraud who has delivered a big-taxing, big-spending budget which is not only fiscally inept and unmanageable but also totally unrealistic. He wishes he could turn the clock back to his schmoozing days on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunrise</inline> breakfast program.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last night he lost the plot, and with it he lost the support of the electorate. After taking a sharp dive in the polls following the shelving of his ETS legislation, not only Kerry O’Brien but also Mr Rudd’s party and his staunch followers are starting to question the Prime Minister’s leadership qualities. Even Dean Mighell recently said on Melbourne radio that he hoped Julia Gillard would be more of a Labor Prime Minister than Kevin Rudd. Her coy, smiling responses to that, though, do not cut the mustard. At last, we hear an honest word from a well-known comrade in the ALP ranks.</para>
<para>The Australian public are now evaluating the so-called achievements of this government, and with good reason. At last they are realising that it has nothing to show but a huge debt. Mr Rudd has failed the Australian people like no other Prime Minister before, and this government is arguably the most appalling and inept in Australian history. Even the supporters of Gough Whitlam now have a smile on their faces. There is nothing left of the last election promises of this government. They either have simply failed to get off the ground or have amounted to little more than unprecedented mismanagement, bungling and outright failure.</para>
<para>Let us go through just a few of them. We are only months from the next federal election and what do we have? There is no ETS. There is no human rights bill, which was pledged. We do not see the 266 childcare centres that were pledged. We do not see all the GP super clinics that were pledged—or the extra aged-care beds or all those trades training centres. What about Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch? What a catastrophic disaster they were. What we have instead is one illegal boat after another arriving and a massive black hole in the budget which, as we all know, will not return to surplus in 2012-13. Speaking of the boat arrivals, that inept social public policy position on border protection has seen a blow-out of a billion dollars and we are now up to a record 125 boats. This government is on the skids and this budget is built on a house of cards.</para>
<para>Mr Rudd’s economic outlook depends entirely on a new tax grab which he will not be able to put into action. The coalition will not support what is nothing but a 40 per cent slug on the profits of resource mining, and he very well knows this. He also knows that Senator Fielding is opposed to this irresponsible and knee-jerk measure. So there is $12 billion of revenue gone that is necessary to return the budget to surplus in the next two years. No wonder the Prime Minister is losing it on public television, and I doubt very much if he is sleeping very well of a night.</para>
<para>The budget deficit this coming year is a massive $40.8 billion. This is the second-biggest deficit since World War II. Labor will have to borrow more than $700 million a week to cover its net debt, the interest payments and to keep the cash flow going. Let us just put that into language that we all understand because I cannot, for the life of me, think how any government could borrow that amount of money. That is over $30 that the government is borrowing for every man, woman and child in this country each week to cover net debt interest payments and to keep the cash flow going. Government debt will be a massive $94 billion in 2012-13, requiring $6.5 billion a year in interest payments; and, with his philosophy to spend billions while saving millions, this will not change. Instead of being economically prudent, as stated so many times, Mr Rudd again flushes Australian taxpayers’ money down the toilet.</para>
<para>But the biggest broken promise of all is the one where the Prime Minister declared himself to be an economic conservative who would keep the budget in surplus. I stand in this chamber today with the message for Mr Rudd: you cannot achieve this goal if you blow a billion dollars on the computers in schools program because you forgot to calculate funding for software, for the training, for the teachers and for the lockers that the kids need to secure the computers in. It is inconceivable that anybody would put together a program like that without appreciating what the add-on needs were.</para>
<para>You cannot return the budget to surplus if you blow out another half a billion dollars for cleaning up the mess you have caused by not administering the catastrophic pink batts bungle, ignoring warnings and risks. When we are talking financially about the fiasco of the insulation program, we must not forget those families who are still traumatised by the loss of loved ones sadly lost in fires. It is just an appalling failure of public policy. You cannot return the budget to surplus if you blow another $1 billion on your failed border management policy, inviting boat people to this country, promising VIP flights and four-star hotel accommodation. You cannot return the budget to surplus by blowing money on the ill-conceived Building the Education Revolution program, which, in my opinion, should be renamed the ‘Building Expensive Restrooms program’.</para>
<para>Mr Rudd has gone on a reckless spending binge which can only be described as economic vandalism. In less than three short years he has replaced a $20 billion surplus with a deficit nearly three times as large. We have repeatedly said in this chamber that it took the former coalition government 10 long and hard years to pay back the staggering $96 billion dollar debt which was the result of the prior Labor government’s spendathon. The list of Mr Rudd’s waste is indeed very impressive. He created a phantom department where 150 public servants implement and administer the government’s ETS, at a cost of $81.9 million, despite the fact that a scheme currently does not exist and, from what we can gather, probably never will exist.</para>
<para>Solar panels, on the other hand, do exist and are very popular with the electorate. Yet this is the very reason why we do not have a solar power program anymore: it was too effective and too successful. They were not able to predict the high demand for this very program, resulting in an $850 million blow-out. Labor, in their infinite wisdom, intended to spend $150 million over five years on solar rebates but instead splurged $1 billion in just 18 months, so the program was abolished. Yes, the bill for fighting the ‘greatest moral challenge of our time’ has been a very costly one. A similar fiasco was Labor’s $175 million Green Loans Program. The audit of the program alone cost taxpayers more than $4 million.</para>
<para>But let us move on, because, as they say, ‘Yes, there is more.’ Labor promised broadband for $4.7 billion but broke that promise, replacing it with a $43 billion plan. Let us not forget that, whilst getting there, they have wasted $20 million on a cancelled tender process and spent $25 million on yet another report. Labor spent over $10 million on legal fees defending the rights of nine Sydney terrorists who were found guilty of terrorism offences. This is more than $1 million for each terrorist. Then taxpayers received the bill for almost $2 million in consultancy fees as Mr Rudd tried to find ways to save money on travel. Just imagine what would happen if all households worked like that! Two separate consultants were hired, one for $1.4 million and the other for almost half a million dollars, to do scoping studies on how to meet the goal of saving $26 million on travel. Every Australian could give him the answer—that is, stay home, fix up your problems here in Australia and look after the interests of all that you are responsible for and accountable to.</para>
<para>The cost of refurbishing Australia’s embassy at the Vatican also cost much more than originally budgeted for. Then we have a bill of $1.3 million to stop accidents that never have happened—this is the amount of money Mr Rudd has spent realigning roads around Parliament House in Canberra. It was something that was raised in the last estimates, and government officials could not remember if a single accident had ever happened on the road around here.</para>
<para>But let us stop looking at the waste from the past; let us have a look at what this budget holds. There is—deeply buried, of course—a $10 million grant to a so-called Trade Union Education Foundation. One could reasonably ask why they are the recipients of a $10 million grant and whether it is to fund union bosses and their efforts to support the Labor government at the forthcoming election. Then we have the proposal of the Rudd government to waste $126 million on taxpayer funded political print, radio and television advertising—government advertising that they pledged they were going to stop at the last election. That $126 million includes $30 million for another climate change advertising campaign, despite the government having no climate change policy.</para>
<para>The same principle applies to paid parental leave. Although the PPL legislation is before parliament, the Rudd government have already committed $12 million to advertise the scheme. We have not even seen the legislation and yet they have allocated $12 million for the scheme. Mr Rudd is also proposing a new $29.5 million advertising campaign to sell his health changes, even though Western Australia has not signed on and all new beds will not even be delivered until 2013-14.</para>
<para>There is only one thing that is consistent about this government and Prime Minister Rudd—that is, their fixation on maxing out on the cash in all programs. I saw today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> in ‘Cut and paste’ his very consistent claims that everything is the biggest ever in the history of Australia. This is an absolute disaster for all Australians.</para>

<para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Rudd government’s strong economic record and about the threats posed to our economy by the opposition—threats that make a mockery of this motion’s claim that we have wasted and mismanaged taxpayers’ money. When the Rudd government’s nation-building economic stimulus plan was announced, we were facing the prospect of a recession and a million Australians out of work. We took the view that we should do all that we responsibly could do to cushion the economy from the global downturn and to protect Australian families, Australian jobs and Australian small business. Because 70 per cent of our fiscal stimulus spending was investment in critical economic and social infrastructure—investments in road, rail, social housing and community facilities—we have been able to bolster consumer and business confidence while expanding Australia’s future economic capacity and boosting local community infrastructure.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Rudd government’s stimulus strategy has been all about protecting jobs now while building a better future. I think that today’s labour force figures are a further tribute to Australian workers and businesses. They have really got behind our stimulus measures. Australia created 225,000 jobs while other countries were shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs. That is 225,000 people who have been able to tell their families, ‘I’ve got a job.’ That is 225,000 people who are still paying tax, still paying their mortgages and keeping our economy going. That is 225,000 people much better placed to pay and provide for themselves and their families. Is that a waste of taxpayers’ money? The results are remarkable given the headwinds generated by the global economic crisis that occurred elsewhere. In the US and Europe, unemployment remains stuck at around 10 per cent while here it is now 5.4 per cent and is expected to keep falling to 4¾ per cent by the June quarter of 2012, we hope. While these figures build confidence in our recovery, they also I think caution against complacency.</para>
<para>Our stimulus program was specifically designed to have its peak effects in the June quarter of 2009 and to phase down gradually after that. I think pulling the plug on stimulus overnight would risk the future of critical nation-building investments and the jobs and small business that depend on them. It would be an act of economic insanity, especially when 600,000 Australians remain unemployed, 60,000 in my home state of Western Australia alone, and when in WA unemployment remains more than two per cent higher than it was in October 2008 when this crisis began and when we recall that after the last recession unemployment took more than a decade to come down to prerecession levels. The fragility of the global recovery has also been underlined in recent weeks by the news from Greece and Spain highlighting the ongoing fragilities in many of the advanced economies of the world.</para>
<para>In this context, the demand from the opposition for the stimulus measures to be wound back is reckless in the extreme. Either the opposition are economically illiterate or they simply do not care about Australia’s unemployed. But Labor does care. We care about those thousands of unemployed Australians, tens of thousands of them in WA alone. Our unemployment data confirms what we on this side of the chamber have been hearing from the community, that times are still tough for many Australians, especially those in small business. Unlike the opposition, who appear to be deaf to these community concerns, we recognise that our stimulus initiatives continue to play a critical role in protecting the living standards of Australians by securing employment and building the productive capacity of the nation.</para>
<para>The Rudd government sees this as the beginning and not the end of the battle—the battle to ensure Australia’s prosperity and to combat the insidious effects of unemployment. Nation building for recovery lies at the heart of the Rudd government’s fiscal stimulus strategy and it also lies at the heart of the budget released by the Treasurer—nation building that will ensure the recovery brings with it new jobs and new investment, greater prosperity and better living standards for all Australians. With the ongoing demand for our commodities from rapidly growing economies in our region, Australia is well placed to benefit from a global recovery. The Rudd government’s policy settings have done much to keep Australians working and to protect Australian living standards.</para>
<para>We must continue to be vigilant. It is about investing in our infrastructure that will support our recovery, unlock our full economic potential and create the jobs of the future, protecting our living standards and ensuring our future prosperity. This government is determined to do the hard yards, the yards required to reform our economy and build a new era of sustainable prosperity. The Rudd government recognises that improving long-term productivity growth will be crucial for Australia’s future productivity and prosperity. It is about sustaining long-term productivity growth in the face of an ageing population. To do this, we must build advanced 21st century infrastructure—things like the NBN. We have to invest in a skilled workforce and we must tackle social exclusion, particularly by removing barriers to work and increasing workforce participation—all things that we have invested in in this budget and all things that will help promote the productivity of this nation. Then there is the $661 million for skills and training, including 70,000 new training places and support for 22,500 apprenticeships over five years. Again, surely this is not a waste of taxpayers’ money.</para>

<para>—Everyone hates getting annoying phone calls during dinnertime from telemarketing companies trying to sell them something. It is the last thing that anyone wants after a hard day’s work. Family First supported the creation of the Do Not Call Register back in 2006 to stop these kinds of calls and we support the changes in the current bill, which will extend people’s registration from three to five years. For many people, telemarketing calls are unwanted—they are a nuisance and an invasion of family time at home. For almost three years now, four million Australians—that is a lot of Australians—have exercised their right to get rid of these unwanted calls by registering themselves on the Do Not Call Register.</para>

<para>—That is four million Australian families who do not want to get unwanted marketing calls—four million Australian families who do not want their time wasted by these annoying calls. But guess what? Up until just a week or so ago, many of these people faced the prospect of dropping off the Do Not Call Register and once again becoming fair game for those nuisance calls. Why? Because their registration on the Do Not Call Register was going to expire. That would have meant many people would drop off the Do Not Call Register leaving them exposed when they thought they were protected by the register. It would also have meant no more quiet dinner times sitting down with the family and catching up on the day’s events; no more undisturbed TV—perhaps watching the Senate—when you get to plonk yourself on the couch after a long day at work; no more quality time with the kids or helping them out with their homework without annoying phone calls. Instead, the government finally got the message that people on the Do Not Call Register really do not want to have to keep on registering over and over again. So what did they do? They drafted an amendment. Did they draft an amendment to ensure that people would be permanently registered on the Do Not Call Register unless they asked otherwise? No, of course not. That would be doing what most people would probably want them to do. Instead, they have extended the length of registration from three years to five years. What that means is that the problem of people dropping off the Do Not Call Register unwittingly has not been fixed; it has been simply delayed. Because in two years from now the people who rushed to put themselves on the register back in May 2007 will be in the same position they are now. Sure, people can re-register themselves on the Do Not Call Register but let us face it, how many people do you think are really going to do this? How many people do you really think actually know that they are going to drop off the list and will need to re-register themselves? The government will probably say they will have some sort of campaign but we all know that that is not as effective as allowing people to register permanently.</para>

<para>I spoke to a number of people and asked them about the Do Not Call Register. None of them had the foggiest idea that you need to re-register. Maybe up in government circles—maybe in <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> land, I do not know—this is the topic of conversation at dinner parties, but I can tell you that out on the street most ordinary Australians would not have a clue. And now, because of shonky public policy, all these people will again be fair game for telemarketers, not now but in two years time. The government is delaying the problem, not fixing it. And what about those vulnerable Australians who most need this protection from those nuisance calls? Those Australians, many of them elderly, who unfortunately are more susceptible to high-pressure tactics and need the protection that the Do Not Call Register provides. There are many vulnerable Australians who really hold on to the fact that their number is not on telemarketers’ lists and I think the government has totally underestimated how much people rely on this register. Does the government really think that these people know that they have to re-register? I cannot believe it.</para>
<para>The worst part about all of this is that it would be so easy to fix this problem but the government refuses to act. In the United States and the United Kingdom registration periods have been removed, so registrations remain permanent. Maybe this is a tactic of the Rudd government to make another election promise and say they will fix it next time around and do it permanently. But in the US and the UK registration periods have been removed so that registrations remain permanent. Claims that permanent registration present a problem are just rubbish. In the US and the UK when a number is deactivated, such as when a person moves house, the register is notified and updated, meaning that even an owner’s new number will not be registered without their knowledge. This shows that permanent registration is possible and can work. There is no evidence of any problems with this system in other jurisdictions. It staggers me that the government will not go the full mile and let people register themselves permanently on the Do Not Call Register. It also staggers me that the government is still giving an exemption to—guess who?—politicians. That is right! Politicians are exempted from the Do Not Call Register. Even if you are registered on the Do Not Call Register, guess what? Politicians are exempted and, yes, they can make those calls. That is a cop-out. It is a disgrace that we ban all other companies but politicians are exempt.</para>

<para>—The issue here is why. Why would they do that? Think about all those pre-recorded messages from the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition going through to the phone. Pollies are exempt. We cannot wait for those phone calls again—maybe from this Prime Minister. I do not know. Maybe those in <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>-land will be exempt! But this is a very serious issue. There are many vulnerable Australians, and to think that politicians are exempted! In my home state of Victoria there are two elections this year, and you can bet your bottom dollar that families across the state are going to be called up and hassled. It is a double standard and I think it is pathetic. It is not just the Labor Party that is guilty of this double standard; the coalition under the Howard government also supported this decision. I have been firm in my position from all the way back in 2006: politicians should be treated just like every other telemarketer or company and made to follow the Do Not Call Register.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Both of these issues—the issue of letting people permanently put themselves on the list and the issue of getting rid of the special exemption for politicians—are matters which need to be dealt with, not put off again for a couple of years. I have circulated amendments which address both of these issues and will continue to hold the government of the day to account on these two matters. The Do Not Call Register was put in place for a very good reason. We need to make sure that we continue to protect those Australians who want to be on the Do Not Call Register, not make it more difficult for them to avoid these annoying nuisance phone calls.</para>

<para>—It is good that we have got to this amended <inline ref="R4239">Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2010</inline> now before the chamber, but it is bad that it has taken so much to get to this. What a waste in getting to this. What a waste of time. What a waste of money. What a waste of work. The government announced its Do Not Call Register proposition at budget time last year. It took them another six months to release discussion papers to start to get legislation drafted. What a waste of time, particularly when it is now incumbent upon this place to pass the bill with amendments to keep existing homeowners’ do-not-call registrations alive. What a waste.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What a waste that it took stakeholders; business, which was supposedly going to benefit from this bill; and the parliament, in particular the opposition and Senate committee processes, to do the homework that the government should have done but, as usual, failed to do in preparing the Do Not Call Register proposal without any sort of evidence based policy. Why all that waste when all this bill was ever based upon was a ministerial whim? That is what it was. In evidence given to Senate inquiries into the bill, Senator Conroy said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It has been a particular concern of mine that unwanted and unsolicited calls and faxes are wasting valuable business resources …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He said that in an attempt to justify the proposition that businesses should be able to register themselves on the Do Not Call Register—a proposition which is now no longer part of the bill. I then asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Do you have evidence from business?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Senator Conroy said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Businesses that choose to register their number clearly want protection against telemarketing calls. If they do not, then they do not have to.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is code from Minister Conroy for ‘We will build it and they will come’—the same sort of code that he is using for the National Broadband Network. His faith was ‘Build the Do Not Call Register and they will come.’ Through the Senate committee process he finally learnt that business would not come. The Senate committee heard, ‘What conscientious CEO would care to register his or her business on the Do Not Call Register, effectively saying, “My business is closed for business”?’ Minister Conroy would have realised, had he done his homework, that the very businesses that were supposedly going to benefit from the Do Not Call Register would not have put themselves on the register in the first place.</para>
<para>He also would have realised that his proposition would not work, because the bill failed to distinguish between so-called telemarketing calls to business and normal business-to-business calls—so much so that pretty much every business making everyday commercial phone calls would have been forced to call a Do Not Call Register authority to check that the very business they wanted to call was not registered on the Do Not Call Register. This presented the absolutely absurd proposition that almost every business would have to call a register to see if a recipient of their call was on it when, in fact, the register would likely be empty. That was proven through the Senate committee process by the relevant department confessing, firstly, that they had no proof of how many businesses would register for the Do Not Call Register if the bill were to proceed in its original form. Secondly, they had no idea, no mapping and no cost-benefit analysis of the number of occasions on which a business wanting to make outgoing phone calls to another business would have to check with the Do Not Call Register, what it would cost them to do so, for what period of time a so-called washed list of numbers you could call would last and what the consequences of that would be. The government had not done its policy homework.</para>
<para>So we have wasted all this time and all this industry resource and effort essentially on a minister’s whim: ‘Let me build it and they will come.’ The Australian people are entitled to ask whether it will be exactly the same with the same minister and his ‘Let me build the National Broadband Network and they will come’.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I will be brief, yet again, because yet again we are running out of time. As the minister just said, this is uncontroversial legislation, but the handling of this legislation by the government is anything but. It is a disgrace that we are here in the last 15 minutes of this week in parliament, the last possible opportunity to deal with this legislation. If we do not deal with this legislation in the next 15 minutes, more than four million families across Australia might be exposed to those nuisance calls from telemarketers that they do not want. Here we are in this position. The government, through its mismanagement, is putting the Senate in this position. Because we are focused on the national interest, because we are focused on the interests of more than four million families across Australia, we are doing the right and the decent thing. The coalition, the Greens and Family First are all facilitating the speedy passage of this bill, but the way this is being handled is a disgrace.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Of course, the whole handling of this legislation since it was introduced in November last year has been a disgrace. The reason the government get themselves into trouble again and again is that they have these ideological slogans, these grandiose statements. They come up with these announcements with great fanfare: ‘We’re going to include all the businesses across Australia in this as well.’ Not thinking things through is what gets them into trouble again and again. That is what delivered us the failure on GroceryWatch, on Fuelwatch, on the ETS. Everything they have touched they have stuffed up.</para>
<para>I did promise that I would keep it short and Senator Fisher explained in some detail the many flaws that the minister had to address belatedly in a late Friday afternoon backflip which he thought he could get away with while no-one was watching, on 30 April. Here we are. This inclusion of businesses in the Do Not Call Register was never going to be workable. We told you so right from the outset. It only took you five or six months to figure it out, and eventually you came onboard with what we told you all along. It is incompetent government. It is a government driven by grandiose ideological statements. They do not think things through. That is why we always end up, under this government’s mismanagement and maladministration, in the sorts of circumstances we are in.</para>
<para>While I am on my feet, and so that I do not have to get on my feet again, I am just going to quickly make a comment in relation to the amendments that Senator Fielding has foreshadowed. The coalition will not be supporting those amendments. Essentially, in relation to the exemption of political parties, we take the view that allowing an exemption for political parties from the register is consistent with other exemptions in the bill which seek to balance the ability of organisations to undertake socially important work. Political parties, Independent MPs—including you, Senator Fielding—and nominated candidates play a vital role in a democratic society and it is important that they be able to continue to make a range of calls to enable them to continue to fulfil their roles.</para>
<para>In relation to permanent registration, we agree with the government that permanent registration on the Do Not Call Register would lead to many practical difficulties with keeping the register accurate and relevant. Industry figures suggest the Do Not Call Register would be 40 per cent out of date within five years if permanent registration were introduced, and 10 per cent of phone numbers, incidentally, are disconnected every year. We agree with the proposition that it would unfairly disadvantage businesses, because they would be forced to comply with a register that does not reflect consumer preferences in relation to receiving telemarketing calls.</para>
<para>With those few words, I conclude my contribution on this particular piece of legislation but yet again point out that it did not have to come to this. We did not have to waste the last five or six months. It came down to the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee, with coalition senators under the leadership of Senator Fisher, to expose the many flaws in this legislation which the government had to address at the last minute. They thought they could do it under the cover of a late Friday afternoon announcement. It is one backflip after another. We are dealing with an incompetent minister, we are dealing with an incompetent government and it is time that they actually learnt that public administration is something that involves a little bit of thinking from time to time.</para>

<para>—They were. They were great. It was a great speech. We were trying to conclude the debate before two o’clock and I think Senator Feeney thought that my complimenting of the government was a little bit backhanded, so I will just make clear what it is that I mean. This is obviously a bandaid. It is a quick fix, but it is one that is appropriate. I would prefer that the government do this, even though they are going to cop a bit of a flogging from the opposition and the crossbenchers for the awkward way in which it is being passed. Better that than to just persist with something that is broken and wrong. I would always prefer, and the Australian Greens would always prefer—and we will not be giving you much of a kicking for—coming back with something that works, with improved legislation that saves the Commonwealth money, rather than pig-headedly persisting with something that is obviously flawed. So we appreciate the opportunity and the consent of the coalition for at least bringing this back so that we can debate it.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We are keenly aware of the consequences if this is held over for another month. Every day that this lapses costs the Commonwealth money, and so we are happy to see it pass this evening. For many of the reasons that Senator Cormann outlined, we will not be supporting the amendments proposed by Senator Fielding, although I have some affinity for them. We believe that maintaining the list in perpetuity will perhaps leave us with many of the issues that the government has used to justify giving us a couple of years extension to sort the system out in future. Presumably we will be revisiting this legislation some time in the new parliament. Hopefully we will be doing it in a fashion a little bit less awkward.</para>

<para class="block">I will talk to both types of amendments—and I spoke to them in my speech quite well. What I will say is that they do permanent registration in the US and the UK. When a number is deactivated, or when someone changes their number, it is taken off the Do Not Call Register and you have to reregister. I understand the Liberal Party’s comments but I am not sure they are really well thought through. But the fact that the US and the UK do it indicates there is a reasonable way of making sure that numbers which have been deactivated do not remain on the register, so that the next owner of the number does not have a do not call number. There are ways around that.</para>
<para>On the removal of exemptions for political parties on the Do Not Call Register, I think a classic example is that of prerecorded messages from the Prime Minister. I think they would be classified as being pretty close to being a nuisance call. I am pretty sure Labor would agree with me, because they called those sorts of calls nuisance calls when the previous government used them. This would be a way of making sure that that did not happen, given that they complained so bitterly about them at the time. There would be consistency if Labor did support it. It is important that there is at least a two-year extension. That is the only reason I agreed to make this legislation non-controversial. I appreciate the chamber allowing me to speak and to raise my concerns, which I have been consistent on, and I am hoping that Labor may do a backflip and support my amendments.</para>

<inline ref="R4280">Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The <inline ref="R4280">Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010</inline> makes amendments to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000.</para>
<para class="block">The Bill amends the table in subsection 14B(1) of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to include additional funding for the Sporting Chance program, in order to bring it into the Commonwealth’s suite of targeted assistance measures and to adjust the 2010 to 2012 appropriations agreed as part of the new Federal Financial Relations Framework.</para>
<para class="block">By amending the appropriations under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 the Australian Government can continue working with a range of stakeholders to develop and implement innovative measures to close the gap.</para>
<para class="block">In education the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous students is stark.</para>
<para class="block">Most indigenous students meet minimum standards of reading, writing and numeracy – but not nearly as many as their non-indigenous classmates.</para>
<para class="block">For example, the 2009 NAPLAN results reveal a gap of 26.4 percentage points between the reading levels of indigenous and non-indigenous Year 5 students.</para>
<para class="block">When they reach Year nine, NAPLAN reveals a 30 point gap between the writing levels of indigenous and non-indigenous students.</para>
<para class="block">The Act provides an excellent vehicle to action good ideas – ideas that deliver results.</para>
<para class="block">The Act maintains commitments to initiatives introduced by the former Government including the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance program.</para>
<para class="block">$10.93m over three years will be used to extend the activities under the Sporting Chance Program – using sport to engage with Indigenous students and show them the value of education.</para>
<para class="block">An example of the program’s achievements can be found in the work of the Clontarf Foundation.</para>
<para class="block">The Foundation has been the major single provider of school-based sports academies for boys under the Sporting Chance Program since projects commenced operations in 2007.</para>
<para class="block">They consistently achieve improvements in attendance, and reports significant success in attainment to Year 12 in schools of which they operate.</para>
<para class="block">Mid year 2009 reporting indicates that average attendance of students in Clontarf academies was 76 per cent compared with 70 per cent.</para>
<para class="block">Mr Speaker</para>
<para class="block">Record Australian Government investment in education is geared towards giving students from all backgrounds and all locations a chance to access a good education.</para>
<para class="block">By focussing on programs—like the Sporting Chance—that are delivering better education outcomes for indigenous students the Australian Government is actively working to close the gap.</para>
<para class="block">The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010 can make an important contribution to that effort and I commend it to the House.</para>

<inline ref="R4334">Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 2) Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This <inline ref="R4334">bill</inline> amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia’s tax laws.</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 1 amends the non-commercial loan rules in Division 7A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to prevent a shareholder of a private company (or an associate of the shareholder) accessing tax‑free dividends through the use of company assets, for less than their market value.</para>
<para class="block">This Schedule also makes a range of other technical amendments to strengthen the non-commercial loan rules by ensuring that they cannot be circumvented by the use of corporate limited partnerships or by interposing entities between a private company and its shareholders.</para>
<para class="block">The Government announced that it would tighten the non‑commercial loan rules in Division 7A as part of the 2009-10 Budget. After listening to the community, particularly the farming and small business communities, the Government has introduced a number of exceptions into this measure to cover the minor use of company assets, the use of assets for income producing purposes where that use would otherwise be deductible and the use of certain dwellings for private purposes.</para>
<para class="block">These amendments will strengthen the operation of Division 7A as an integrity measure, providing greater equity and fairness to taxpayers.</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 2 amends the taxation laws to extend tax file number withholding arrangements to closely held trusts, including family trusts.</para>
<para class="block">Generally, the new tax file number withholding arrangements will apply to the trustees of closely held trusts and family trusts where the trustee makes a payment of income to the beneficiary or the beneficiary is presently entitled to be paid a share of the income of the trust and the beneficiary of the trust has not provided their tax file number to the trustee.</para>
<para class="block">To allow the Australian Tax Office data matching and ensure the effective operation of the system, the new tax file number withholding framework includes various reporting and remittance obligations.</para>
<para class="block">This measure will improve the fairness and integrity of the taxation system by equipping the Tax Office with the information necessary to match amounts assessable to beneficiaries of these trusts, with amounts reported in the beneficiary’s income tax return and thus help ensure that beneficiaries of these trusts pay their fair share of tax</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 3 exempts from income tax the value of the HECS-HELP benefit received by an eligible applicant.</para>
<para class="block">The HECS-HELP benefit, or Higher Education Contribution Scheme-Higher Education Loan Programme benefit, was an initiative first introduced in the 2008-09 Budget. The benefit gives eligible recipients a reduction in their HECS debt repayment and/or their HELP debt repayment or, in some cases where a repayment is not required due to low income, a direct reduction in their HELP debt.</para>
<para class="block">The benefit was initially introduced for mathematics and science graduates and early childhood education teachers. In the 2009-10 Budget it was announced that the benefit had been extended to nurses and teachers generally.</para>
<para class="block">The amendments ensure that no income tax is payable on the value of the benefit received by eligible recipients.</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 4 amends the list of deductible gift recipients, or DGRs, in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status. DGR status assists the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities.</para>
<para class="block">This Schedule adds two new organisations to the 1997 Act, namely the Sichuan Earthquake Surviving Children’s Education Fund and the Bali Peace Park Association Inc.</para>
<para class="block">This Schedule also extends the period that the Yachad Accelerated Learning Project Limited can collect deductible gifts for another three years.</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to make the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute Limited income tax exempt for a four-year period.</para>
<para class="block">The Institute is a not-for-profit-organisation that aims to accelerate the development and global adoption of safe, commercially and environmentally sustainable carbon capture and storage technology.</para>
<para class="block">Carbon capture and storage technology aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels burnt during industrial processes, such as coal powered electricity generation. It involves the capture, compression, transport, long-term storage and monitoring of carbon emissions that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere.</para>
<para class="block">The Institute’s purpose is to drive the commercial uptake and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies, which would have significant positive consequences for the global environment.</para>
<para class="block">There may also be an economic benefit to Australia of investing in environmentally sustainable industries through carbon capture and storage technologies. Australia has the fourth largest coal reserves in the world, and is the world’s largest exporter of coal.</para>
<para class="block">The information and expertise developed by the Institute is to be disseminated broadly and globally to the benefit of both the Australian and the global carbon capture and storage communities.</para>
<para class="block">Supporting the Institute by making it income tax exempt is a part of the Government’s strategy to mitigate the risks of climate change.</para>
<para class="block">Schedule 6 repeals over one hundred provisions in the tax laws that provide the Commissioner of Taxation with an unlimited period to amend taxpayers’ assessments.</para>
<para class="block">Generally, under the current law, amendments to the taxpayers’ assessments may be made within specific time periods, including in certain circumstances, time periods that are unlimited.</para>
<para class="block">The repeal of the unlimited amendment period provisions within this Schedule include provisions where the standard two to four-year amendment period would provide sufficient time for the Commissioner to examine and make any necessary amendments to the relevant assessment. For these provisions, the standard amendment period will also retain an unlimited amendment period in cases of fraud and evasion.</para>
<para class="block">This will have the effect of reducing the volume of unnecessary and redundant provisions in the taxation laws, as well as assisting in providing more certainty to taxpayers in their taxation affairs.</para>
<para class="block">Full details of the measures in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para>

<inline ref="R4315">Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill 2010</inline>
</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am pleased to present legislation addressing minor but necessary measures that will remove anomalies between veterans’ entitlements law and social security law.</para>
<para class="block">These amendments are a demonstration of the Government’s commitment to continually review, update and improve the services and support we provide to our current and former military personnel.</para>
<para class="block">They remove anomalies between related laws that might otherwise frustrate veterans and their families through inconsistent treatment of income and assets in certain circumstances.</para>
<para class="block">The <inline ref="R4315">bill</inline> includes amendments that will exempt, from the veterans’ entitlements income test, payments associated with part-time work experience under a Labour Market Program.</para>
<para class="block">This measure aligns the veterans’ entitlements law with the social security law and ensures the consistent treatment of these types of payments across both Acts.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will also amend the Veterans’ Entitlements Act so that the partner of a service pension or income support supplement claimant or recipient, will be required to claim a comparable foreign pension if the partner is entitled to such a pension.</para>
<para class="block">This provides consistency between the veterans’ entitlements law and the social security law and can result in a pensioner couple receiving more income overall.</para>
<para class="block">For those persons currently receiving a service pension or income support supplement, their partners, where entitled to a comparable foreign pension, will be given six months to claim the pension.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will also change the income test treatment of arrears payments of comparable foreign pensions so that the treatment of such arrears payments parallels that under the social security law.</para>
<para class="block">This treatment generally provides a better result for the pensioner and will close a potential loophole in the legislation.</para>
<para class="block">Instead of treating the arrears payment as income in the 12 month period from the date of grant of the comparable foreign pension, these amendments will mean that the arrears payment is treated as periodical payments for the period of the arrears.</para>
<para class="block">The majority of cases will benefit from this change and the amendments will remove the opportunity for pensioners to change to a social security pension to potentially avoid the income test in relation to the arrears payment.</para>
<para class="block">The bill will repeal from the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, all references to benevolent homes.</para>
<para class="block">The provisions have become redundant as benevolent homes no longer exist and there are no longer any Veterans’ Affairs beneficiaries who are affected by these provisions.</para>
<para class="block">Finally, the bill will clarify that the value of certain superannuation investments specified in a determination by the Minister to be disregarded for the purposes of the assets test, are not disregarded for the purposes of the deemed income rules and the asset deprivation rules.</para>
<para class="block">The exceptions will ensure that the veterans’ entitlements means test will continue to operate so that those most in need will receive the most benefit from our repatriation pension system.</para>
<para class="block">These corrections to the legislation will protect the integrity of the means test and the pension system by ensuring that specified superannuation investments are treated as originally intended and are counted as financial assets when calculating deemed income and will continue to be regarded as assets if the asset has been disposed of for less than adequate or no consideration.</para>
<para class="block">This Bill continues the Government’s ongoing commitment to supporting Australia’s veteran community and their families and ensuring their well-being now and into the future.</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">Of the three budgets delivered by the Rudd Government, this is the most political, the least believable, and the most damaging to Australia’s long term future. It’s a typical, old-fashioned, tax-and-spend Labor Budget that also features all the debt and deficit that can be expected from Labor, only covered up by clever accounting and a great big new tax on mining.</para>
<para class="block">If the government’s revenues really had exceeded expenditure, it would be entitled to claim prudent economic management. What the government has actually delivered, though, as opposed to talk about, is a $57 billion deficit this year – the biggest ever. What the government is actually doing now, as opposed to promising in three years time, is borrowing $700 million every week till then.</para>
<para class="block">Brazenly, the government wants credit for a surplus that doesn’t yet exist and that it’s unlikely ever to achieve. The surplus that it says will happen in three years time is based on increased taxes and on the growth that those increased taxes will almost certainly strangle.</para>
<para class="block">That $1 billion surplus is roughly the amount required to fix the pink batts program that’s been linked to four deaths; the amount required to pay for the extra detention measures needed because the government has lost control of our borders; or the blow out in the computers in schools programme. It’s roughly half the blow-out in the school hall programme.</para>
<para class="block">Does anybody seriously believe, based on this record, that a re-elected Rudd government could avoid another, surplus-shattering disaster sometime in the next three years?</para>
<para class="block">It took the last Labor government thirteen years to accumulate $96 billion of debt but this Labor Government expects to do the same in less than half the time. It took a change of government to get Labor’s debt paid off last time and, once again, the quickest way to get rid of this debt will be to get rid of this government.</para>
<para class="block">Everyone wants our country to succeed and many still hope that our Prime Minister is up to the job but there’s always this question: why should his latest promises turn out to be more credible than the ones that he’s already broken? Amidst all the self-congratulation about how historic this budget is, you almost expected the Prime Minister to declare that fixing the deficit is the greatest moral challenge of our time.</para>
<para class="block">In his 2007 Budget reply, the then opposition leader, now the Prime Minister said “we must remain committed to keeping taxes low”. But he has just increased the cigarette tax and added a new mining tax to the 125 separate taxes that Australia already has.</para>
<para class="block">He said then that a Labor government would withdraw an existing regulation for every new one imposed on business. In office, he has introduced 9997 new or amended regulations and withdrawn just 52.</para>
<para class="block">He said then that he would pursue “a conservative fiscal policy” but proceeded to unleash the greatest spending spree in Australian history, turning a $20 billion surplus into a $27 billion deficit in just one year.</para>
<para class="block">The Prime Minister said then that he was committed to “working families hit hard by the cost of mortgage repayments, food prices, petrol…and childcare”. His spendathon has contributed to six interest rate rises in the last eight months, with housing affordability at record lows and a $4500 a year hit on families with a $300,000 mortgage.</para>
<para class="block">He’s abandoned his fuel watch and grocery watch schemes, though prices keep going up, and he’s dumped his childcare commitment after building less than 40 of the promised 260 centres.</para>
<para class="block">The Prime Minister said then that the “economic cost of not acting (on climate change) will be far greater than the cost of taking early and responsible action”.  As recently as November he said that to delay action would be “absolute political cowardice”, and an “absolute failure of leadership”.</para>
<para class="block">But he now won’t do anything about it till sometime next term for fear of fighting an election on tax. Instead, there’s a different great big new tax that will now be the issue on which the election turns.</para>
<para class="block">Mr Rudd observed in 2007 that “mining booms don’t last forever”. They certainly don’t when governments threaten to kill them with a new tax that will eventually choke the goose that’s laid the golden egg for Australia. Despite its name, this is not a normal tax on super profits. It’s a super tax on normal profits.</para>
<para class="block">Every company extracting non-renewable resources will have to pay an additional 40 per cent tax, as well as normal tax, once its rate of return on capital exceeds the long term bond rate or about 6 per cent. The new tax applies to the extraction of phosphate, sand and stone as well as to the extraction of minerals, oil and gas. It’s a tax on small quarries as well as big miners.</para>
<para class="block">It will impact on the price of fertilisers and building materials as well as on the price of energy. It’s a triple whammy tax on the jobs of half a million mining and related workers, on the superannuation of millions of retirees with mining shares and on the cost of living of everyone who uses power.</para>
<para class="block">It will increase the effective rate of tax on all mining from 44 to 57 per cent. Already, Australia heavily taxes the extraction of resources. The proposed new 57 per cent rate would make Australian taxes the highest in the world.</para>
<para class="block">It’s amazing how quickly BHP and Rio Tinto have gone from being lionized to demonized. The government says that this new tax is needed to stop foreign companies ripping us off. In fact, there would be no wealth to redistribute if those same companies and their shareholders had not invested serious money to turn untapped resources into national wealth.</para>
<para class="block">Imposing a prohibitive rate of tax on returns above 6 per cent sends an implicit message to business people that they would be better off putting their money in the bank. After all, who would bother to take the risks of investing in actual production if there’s an extra penalty on success?</para>
<para class="block">This great big new tax has already put all investment decisions on hold. Rio has said that its investment in Australia will be reviewed. Xstrata has indefinitely suspended new exploration in north Queensland. BHP has raised doubts about new coal mines in Queensland, iron ore and uranium mines in Western Australia and, particularly, the $22 billion expansion of the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia.</para>
<para class="block">It is hard to overstate the seriousness of this. A 40 per cent tax on so called super profits coupled with a 40 per cent government rebate for losses penalizes good projects and rewards the duds. Perversely, it gives an unfair advantage to projects backed by foreign sovereign wealth funds which won’t need to satisfy normal commercial risk assessment. These projects could then transfer price profits out of Australia and sell ventures at a loss subsidised by Australian taxpayers.</para>
<para class="block">By this budget’s bizarre logic, putting a new tax on cigarettes means less smoking but putting a new tax on resources means more mining. If this tax is going to be so good for the resources sector, why aren’t other industries lining up to beg for a super profits tax to be imposed on them?</para>
<para class="block">The budget formula assumes the best terms of trade in 60 years, assumes that higher taxes have no impact on investment, assumes a 4 per cent growth rate and, presto, the deficit disappears three years early without the need for any hard decisions. If only company promoters could get away with such a prospectus.</para>
<para class="block">Yet if growth really is such a sure thing, why does the government also keep warning that “we’re not out of the woods yet”?</para>
<para class="block">A responsible government would understand that it’s better to reform your way through hard times than to try to spend your way out of them. Even the worthy-sounding measures in this budget are unlikely to make much difference to the real problems that people face.</para>
<para class="block">The government’s savings cameo, for instance, has a person earning just $40,000 a year putting aside $50 a week for several years to generate $20,000 in savings bank deposits for a $177 a year tax break. No one with any idea of the cost pressures on low income earners would find this very plausible.</para>
<para class="block">More GP “super clinics” sound like a good idea too except that 36 were promised at the last election and only two are actually operational. In fact, fee-for-service under Medicare has already produced hundreds of private sector equivalents and these don’t deserve unfair competition from government-funded rivals.</para>
<para class="block">Of course, there should be an electronic health record but hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent to make this a reality and no more should be spent until it’s certain that we’re not throwing good money after bad.</para>
<para class="block">Of course, there should be more defence spending but not to produce 1500 more “suits” and 500 fewer “uniforms”. In these respects, this budget is more about looking good than doing good.</para>
<para class="block">Before the last election, Labor promised to eliminate wasteful government advertising. Instead, it’s eliminated auditor-general scrutiny of government ad campaigns and has just put aside $74 million for taxpayer funded pre-election blitzes about climate change, the national broadband network and hospital reform.  </para>
<para class="block">Then there’s the dishonesty of the government’s sales pitch. The mining tax was not a recommendation of the Henry review. Henry recommended a replacement tax not an additional one and an offsetting 5 per cent not a 2 per cent cut in corporate tax.</para>
<para class="block">The mining tax does not fund the increased superannuation. That’s funded by a separate 3 per cent levy on payroll that will be an additional cost to business or forgone wages to workers.</para>
<para class="block">The mining tax is not an onshore version of the existing resource rent tax on offshore projects.  That tax substituted for state royalties which don’t apply offshore, was prospective not retrospective, and only cuts in after a much higher rate of return.</para>
<para class="block">If a 6 per cent rate of return is a “super” profit for mining, how can it be just “modest” for the government-owned national broadband network – as one minister claimed - and what other unpopular industries might be the next target of penalty taxes?</para>
<para class="block">It’s true that Australia has so far survived the Global Financial Crisis in better shape than almost any other nation. The issue is whether this success is due to the spending spree of the current government or to the reforms of previous ones; whether it’s due to the government’s management skills or to our resource exports to China? The question, I think, only has to be asked for the answer to be obvious.</para>
<para class="block">There is a low road and a high road to achieving a surplus. The high road is expenditure restraint and economic reform. The low road is increasing taxes and making assumptions about economic growth.</para>
<para class="block">The budget’s projections depend more on the success of the Chinese economy than on any decisions that the Rudd government has taken. In opposition, Labor often accused the then government of riding the China boom.</para>
<para class="block">Say what you like about John Howard and Peter Costello but they didn’t shirk the hard reform and they didn’t need to hit miners with extra tax to generate a surplus. Their surpluses were the result of tough decisions, not new taxes.</para>
<para class="block">Let me make this clear: the Coalition will oppose the mining tax in opposition and we will rescind it in government.</para>
<para class="block">I have one message for Mr Rudd. It’s one he should be familiar with: this reckless spending must stop.</para>
<para class="block">Until Labor’s debt and deficit has been dealt with it’s not hardness of heart but economic prudence to say “no” even to good causes. In other circumstances, you could fund a company tax cut and depreciation allowances for small business but not at the cost of an economy-stopping tax on our most successful export industry.</para>
<para class="block">It would be robbing Peter to pay Paul and playing to the kind of class war envy that Mr Rudd’s Labor predecessors have mostly been too honourable to exploit.</para>
<para class="block">It’s my goal to return the budget to surplus at least as quickly as the government proposes but not the lazy way through a great big new tax that threatens miners’ jobs, retirees’ incomes and everybody’s standard of living.</para>
<para class="block">Fostering a savings culture is important but the government should come clean about whether higher superannuation contributions are to be paid out of workers’ pockets or by their employers. If it means an extra three per cent tax payroll tax on every business, that’s a $20 billion a year handbrake on economic growth.</para>
<para class="block">The Coalition will spend more on health but only where we’re certain that extra spending will produce extra services. Improved Medicare rebates, for instance, would be a better way than phantom clinics to deliver improved primary care.</para>
<para class="block">I’m happy to let the Labor Party win any race to raise taxes. Taxes and spending will always be lower and government will always be smaller under the Coalition. That should also mean that economic growth will be higher and that the size of government will always be about one per cent of GDP less under the Coalition.</para>
<para class="block">For nine years, I was a minister in a government that delivered lower taxes and higher surpluses because it did not shirk the hard decisions needed to reform our economy. I was part of a government that understood that you can’t spend what you haven’t got and that you can only create real wealth by hard work.</para>
<para class="block">I know, as anyone who has spent time in remote indigenous townships should, that you can’t have much of a community without an economy to sustain it.</para>
<para class="block">The first principle of government should be: “do no harm”. The Coalition wants lower taxes, smaller government and greater freedom. It wants a fair go for families and respect for institutions that have stood the test of time. These instincts are in our DNA.</para>
<para class="block">The Coalition wants an Australia that is prosperous, united and respected; where families’ choices are taken seriously by government; where pensioners and carers are regarded as people who have served and are serving our country; where officials understand that the public are their masters not their servants; where migrants are welcome but borders are secure; where people’s taxes give them decent hospitals and proper highways; and where the armed forces represent our country’s best values. But we also know that government can’t solve all problems immediately and that over-promising and under-delivering politicians are the cause of so much cynicism about public life.</para>
<para class="block">A good cause never justifies wasting money. On coming to government the Coalition would immediately restructure the school hall programme and provide further funding to school communities, not to state bureaucracies. Parents are normally better than bureaucrats at getting value for their school.</para>
<para class="block">The latest industry data suggests that, had parents been distributing the money, they could have obtained almost twice the build for half the spend.</para>
<para class="block">Likewise, the Coalition won’t go ahead with the National Broadband Network avoiding the creation of a $43 billion white elephant. Better access to faster broadband should not mean a new nationalized telecommunications monopoly and Telstra shareholders should not have their assets subject to coerced acquisition.</para>
<para class="block">The former government’s workplace reforms went too far but they helped to create more than 2 million new jobs, lift real wages by 20 per cent and more than double net household wealth between 1996 and 2007. We’ll seek to take the unfair dismissal monkey off the back of small businesses which are more like families than institutions.</para>
<para class="block">We’ll make Labor’s transitional employment agreements less transitional and Labor’s individual flexibility agreements more flexible. We have faith in Australian workers who are not as easily pushed around and exploited as the ACTU’s dishonest ad campaign is already making out.</para>
<para class="block">If elected, we will be faithful to the liberal conservative tradition. But we will strive to be better than the former government, not just a copy of it. We will be a contemporary government, not just a conservative one.</para>
<para class="block">For starters, there’ll be a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme which gives women six months leave at their full pay. That’s real time and real money to care for their newborns.</para>
<para class="block">Parental leave is a workplace entitlement not a welfare one. It should be paid for by business but not in way which could lead to discrimination against female staff or hurt small business. Only the Labor Party habitually increases businesses’ cost burden and if the current government had not completely blown the surplus it wouldn’t be necessary.</para>
<para class="block">But all benefits have to be paid for and the fairest way to have a paid parental leave scheme anytime soon is through a modest levy on companies’ taxable income over $5 million a year. It will be a universal scheme but, importantly, won’t mean any extra cost for small business.</para>
<para class="block">The Coalition’s paid parental leave policy is good for women who will finally have more realistic choices to combine work and family. It’s good for all those families that need two incomes to pay the mortgage helping them when they are most financially vulnerable.</para>
<para class="block">And it’s good for the economy which won’t lose some of the best workers because they can’t do justice both to their jobs and to their families. More freedom for mothers to work, if that’s their choice, is a productivity measure not just a social reform.</para>
<para class="block">The Coalition will fight Mr Rudd’s means test on the private health insurance rebate because it’s yet another one of his broken promises and because strong private hospitals take the pressure off public waiting lists.</para>
<para class="block">It’s previously been calculated that every dollar the government spends on the rebate brings more private money into healthcare saving two dollars that government would otherwise have to spend on health. As well, we’ll ensure that Medibank Private really is private by selling it and using the proceeds to reduce government debt.</para>
<para class="block">Before becoming Prime Minister, Mr Rudd attacked the “bloating” of the federal bureaucracy but has since added nearly 20,000 to the 258,000-strong Australian Public Service.</para>
<para class="block">To rein in spending, the Coalition will introduce a two year recruitment freeze to reduce public servant numbers through natural attrition. The freeze will apply on an agency-by-agency basis but uniformed and frontline service positions including, for example, the federal police, customs and quarantine, the Australian Defence Force and Centrelink customer service staff will be excluded.</para>
<para class="block">There will be no redundancies but for two years 6,000 bureaucrats who retire or resign each year will not be replaced. This should deliver a modest reduction in public sector numbers without compromising essential services and save about $4 billion over the forward estimates.</para>
<para class="block">As well, the Coalition would not proceed with the budget increase to the renewable energy future fund and will cut government advertising by 25 per cent. These savings will pay for the Coalition’s direct action on climate change policy, the Green Army and the retention of the current private health insurance rebate.</para>
<para class="block"> Next Wednesday at the National Press Club, Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey will announce further measures to reduce spending and to increase productivity including a detailed response to the new spending and new savings proposals in the budget.</para>
<para class="block">The final costing and funding details of Coalition policy will be released nearer the election but all policies will be fully costed and fully funded because the Australian people are entitled to reassurance that the alternative government’s promises are responsible and achievable.  </para>
<para class="block">The Coalition has changed over the past two and a half years. We’ve heeded the lessons of defeat. We’ve learnt from our mistakes.</para>
<para class="block">We know, unlike our opponents, that governments shouldn’t ignore expert advice about the lethal dangers of their programmes, shouldn’t decide to change the health system without taking the premiers into their confidence and shouldn’t decide, with minimal Treasury input, to put a new tax on mining without first talking to the people whose livelihoods are on the line.</para>
<para class="block">The government has changed too. It no longer seems to stand for many of the things it used to, like combating climate change and ending the blame game. Conversely, it does seem to stand for things that no one would once have expected, like a chronic inability to take advice and a dangerous tendency to make policy on the run.</para>
<para class="block">In the end, it’s a judgment about who can be trusted with the fate of the country that decides elections. This budget rests on the government’s new mining tax and the election should turn on this too.</para>
<para class="block">Australia’s future depends on the bulk carriers travelling to Asia just as surely as it once rode on the sheep’s back. This election, like the budget, will pit a party that thinks it’s reasonable to make Australian miners the world’s highest taxed against one that doesn’t.</para>
<para class="block">The die is cast. Neither side will retreat. The only way to stop this great big new tax on the people who saved us from the recession is to change the government.</para>

<para>—It gives me great pleasure to speak tonight on the alternatives which the Australian Greens would have put forward in the budget context and will be moving to implement in this parliament, in the consequent parliament and in coming fiscal years. I first of all want to pay a tribute to my colleagues, Senators Christine Milne, Rachel Siewert, Sarah Hanson-Young and Scott Ludlam, who are prodigious workers in this place and who ensure that the Greens as the third political party in this nation are not only across all issues but in advance of the big parties in advocating alternatives for a nation which badly needs a lead, which badly needs innovation, which badly needs imagination in politics and which badly needs a closer connection with the Australian people, who pay us to be here.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A little less than a year ago, the country was faced with the prospect of recession. All of us will remember the projections from Treasury, which showed that by the final quarter of last year we would be in recession unless the government acted swiftly in the face of the global downturn. In that circumstance, in February last year the government brought forward a package of some $42 billion to stimulate the economy. The first thing the opposition did, the Liberal and National parties, was to announce that they would block that stimulus program. That immediately threw the challenge to us Greens. In consideration with my colleagues, we recognised that while we did not support all the components of such a huge taking of taxpayers’ money and applying it to, in no small measure, the big end of town as well as to such worthy projects as a building program for 9,000 schools across this country, we would support that package and we did so.</para>
<para>We took the responsible option of negotiating with Treasurer Swan, the Prime Minister and several other ministers to improve that package. As a result, a jobs dividend came from the Greens work and thousands more Australians were employed. Not only that, those people who did not survive with their businesses or jobs intact got a much better deal from the government to tide them over until the worst of the recession had passed. We Greens are proud of that arrangement we made with government. It did involve $100 million to stimulate jobs right across rural and regional Australia, including in the refurbishment of this nation’s great heritage, for which there was no budget line until the Greens arrived and got $60 million put into these job-rich projects, and another $40 million for bikeways in all states and territories of the country.</para>
<para>We are also aware now that, in hindsight, it is the consensus of social commentators and economists that it was that stimulus package which the Greens made possible—and I pay tribute to our two crossbench colleagues, by the way, who were essential to its success—that prevented the country from heading to double-digit unemployment, and we are talking about hundreds of thousands of Australians out of work had the coalition succeeded in its negative attitude, which is ‘block everything the Labor government puts forward’. In this budget the country now has a forecast of 4.75 per cent unemployment by next year. What a remarkable achievement that is. Without the Greens that would not have happened. We are very proud of the role we took, responsibly, in the economic management of this country when the National and Liberal coalition failed at a moment of crisis for the nation.</para>
<para>Climate change is still coming rapidly upon the planet, and Australia is one of the most exposed and potentially damaged countries in the world. Yet the government has decided to set aside for three years further action on climate change, and the opposition have a polyglot of proposals which do not take government responsibility seriously should they be elected to government. Faced with a proposal which included a $20 billion waste of public money, if I correctly interpret the Grattan report of just a couple of weeks ago, the Greens have been proven right in not accepting the government’s proposal nor its failure to adequately tackle climate change with a prescription for five per cent downturn in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 rather than 25 to 40 per cent, which is required if we are really going to be successful in protecting the Great Barrier Reef, our snowfields, the productivity of the Murray-Darling Basin and a great deal more that is at stake in Australia in the coming century.</para>
<para>Instead, the Greens earlier this year took up Professor Garnaut’s proposal for an interim carbon tax. You will know the details of that. I want simply to point to what some of the commentators have said about the Greens’ proposal, which in this parliament and in the run to the election is the only consistent, nationally directed action plan to tackle climate change. I might add that, rather than costing taxpayers billions of dollars, as the government’s ETS proposal would be doing in this and subsequent budgets, the Greens’ proposal would bring in some $10 billion a year from a pollution tax on the 1,000 biggest polluters in the country, $5 billion of it earmarked to help households facing climate change right across the country. It would be a community dividend as well as a stimulus to business and a reorienting of our economy to green in an age when we must do that if we are going to face the challenge of much bigger and stronger economies—witness China and India for two.</para>
<para>Dr Frank Jotzo, a leading environmental economist from the Australian National University and an adviser to the original Garnaut review, said the Greens’ proposal:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… is a very sensible proposal. It was first suggested by Professor Garnaut to start the emissions trading scheme system with a fixed price and I believe that it’s even more relevant now in the political deadlock that we’re finding in Parliament.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Acting Deputy President, on carbon tax generally you might listen to these comments from Geoff Carmody—no Green but a co-founder of Access Economics and before that a senior officer in the Commonwealth Treasury—who said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A carbon tax allows a steady, predictable, ramping up of the price of carbon over time, allowing business (and, ultimately, consumers) to plan against this prospect and shift to lower emissions technology and more efficiency in energy use.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Professor Joseph Stiglitz from Columbia University, a Nobel laureate, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Economic efficiency requires that those who generate emissions pay the cost, and the simplest way of forcing them to do so is through a carbon tax … Indeed, it makes far more sense to tax bad things, like pollution, than to tax good things like work and savings.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Dr Richard Denniss is Executive Director of the Australia Institute and an adjunct associate professor in economics at the ANU. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But the beauty of a carbon tax compared to an emissions trading scheme is that it is easy to design complementary policies, such as investments in energy efficiency, public transport and renewable energy, to augment the impact of a carbon tax.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Professor William Nordhouse, Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The international community should move quickly to replace the current cap-and-trade structure with one in which the central economic mechanism is a tax on greenhouse-gas emissions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These are comments that absolutely back the wisdom of the Greens’ proposal for a carbon tax at $23 a tonne of emissions now, ramping up at four per cent plus CPI into the future, allowing the way for a much more successful emissions trading option or carbon tax option in the future. It is to be noted that carbon taxes have been imposed in Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom, for example. As Kenneth Davidson commented in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last year:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Sweden is the most successful country in the world in reducing its carbon footprint … Between 1990 and 2006 Sweden cut its emissions by 9 per cent, exceeding the target set by Kyoto, while at the same time real growth increased 44 per cent.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This Greens prescription is central to the emerging political reality that it is the Greens who will present a positive alternative when neither of the big parties steps up to the mark with proposals that meet the biggest potential economic challenge of the age, which is climate change.</para>
<para>Finally, I quote Professor James Hansen, the director of NASA’s Goddard Institute and dubbed ‘the godfather of climate science’, who was in Australia recently and was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If we had a democracy where decisions were based on the public’s best interest, then that—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, the Greens’ proposal—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">would be taken up in a heartbeat … Neither of the major parties gets it—or they don’t want to get it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That speaks for itself.</para>
<para>The mining boom tax has been seriously panned by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, in the House of Representatives tonight. It cannot pass notice here, of course, that the government’s proposed mining boom tax, which the Greens support, is a progressive tax on the huge, multibillion-dollar profits coming to the big mining corporations, which, as the Prime Minister pointed out, have massive transfer of funds overseas from those profits, using the Australian people’s own ore resource in the Australian ground.</para>
<para>I remember, because I was in this place, that the GST was favoured by Mr Abbott in the Howard government. It was a regressive tax which hit people right across the board. The lower your income, the greater was the impact of the tax. Mr Abbott tonight spoke about the impact of a mining boom tax on average Australians. As the Greens see it, properly applied it will be a boon for average Australians, not like the GST, which as a fundraiser has added a great deal to Australian society but which hit the poor much harder than it did the very wealthy, the multimillionaires, who are organising the current protest against this mining boom tax.</para>
<para>The Greens would, however, see a sovereign fund set up, as the Norwegians have done with their windfall profits from mining and from the petroleum and gas reserves of the North Sea. That small country, with fewer than five million people, has put aside $450 billion for its future infrastructure and the progress of its society. The Australian government would do well to do the same. The Greens will be pursuing that strongly when legislation comes into this parliament, if it does, in the coming year to ensure that we wisely put aside money for the nation’s future and not simply return it, as the government would do, to instant proposals, including the building of infrastructure for the very same mining corporations to export coal faster through taxpayer funded railways and port facilities—including those on the Great Barrier Reef—to line the pockets of people other than average Australians.</para>
<para>The Australian Greens support the government’s $7.3 billion per annum health reform package, as we did the private health insurance rebate, which was unsuccessful in this Senate but which was supported by the Greens alone when the government brought it forward earlier this year. We are very strong advocates for better spending in the areas of mental health and dental health for this country. We believe we now have the resources to do that and we should be pursuing it. The Greens are calling for a minimum of $350 million per annum for mental health over the next four years. That would put $100 million a year worth of incentives at the primary care level to target those in need—the vulnerable and long-term clientele within the community and the NGO sector. That would also afford $150 million per year for early intervention mental health programs, including the youth mental health service, ‘headspace’, and early psychosis prevention services. It would also mean $100 million a year for alternatives to emergency department treatment such as multidisciplinary community based subacute services that support stepped or two-stage prevention and recovery care for people suffering mental problems or illnesses.</para>
<para>Denticare is the clear concept of paralleling Medicare by ensuring that all Australians have ready and easy access to dental health care. The failure of government to provide dental health care to everybody in this country remains a black hole—caries—in the delivery of health care in the country. A full national scheme would cost about $4.8 billion per annum. One billion dollars or so is spent on dental health care in current schemes. We could well fund that amount by, for example, reducing the fuel tax credit scheme for miners by $1.7 billion. How much better to be putting that into dental health care for people who have to wait months otherwise for treatment of their dental problems. We could add to that the rethinking of the $0.7 billion for coal and mining infrastructure out of the mining boom tax, which I just referred to. The $1 billion per annum dished out each year in the fringe benefit tax rebate on corporate vehicle fleets could be diverted to a national dental healthcare system. This is no great difficulty. It is just a failure of policy, imagination and carry-through from both the big parties. This has been advocated for decades, but it is the Greens here who have funding proposals for a national dental healthcare system—funded from the wealth of this country at the moment.</para>
<para>On some particulars from the Rudd government’s budget, I note that there is $27 billion over six years on roads. We are in peak oil. We are facing an enormous cost, both in pollution and in real costs for transport, if we depend upon the road system. We Greens would do much more to advance public transport, bikeways and a high-speed rail system. It will not have passed your notice that the government and the opposition both in the last few days have voted down the Greens proposal for a feasibility study into high-speed rail. It is an extraordinary failure not just of imagination but also of determination not to look at this proposal. The proposal is a must for this nation’s future. It is a proposal for high-speed rail linking the big cities of the eastern seaboard, and later all the big cities of this country. We see it going ahead apace in Saudi Arabia; in Argentina; in the United States; in the United Kingdom; in China, where a train recently reached 510 kilometres an hour; and in France, where standard high-speed rail is at 340 kilometres an hour. But in Australia we have two major parties who cannot step up to the plate, who are failures when it comes to the delivery of innovative public transport and who have even voted down a proposal to even look at high-speed rail in 2010. It is a proposal which I wrote to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, about today—again—saying, ‘Let’s get together and talk about this.’ A $10 million injection of funds would get world’s best expertise into Australia in the coming 12 months so that we could look at this fantastic high-speed rail facility—not least between Sydney and Melbourne, the third or fourth busiest air route in the world. Passengers could comfortably travel between those two cities in peak hours as quickly as, if not faster than, they can at the moment by air. They have to travel through peak hour traffic and go through all the delays in airports. Instead, they can travel in comfort while being able to access computers, mobile phones and entertainment en route.</para>
<para>Unemployment benefits still sit at $231 per week. Through the actions of the Greens, pensions were raised last year by $30 to $332. We would lift the decreasing number—if projections are right for the next year—of people employed in this country. Unemployment is decreasing because of Greens actions—following on a Labor government proposal for the stimulus package—out of that level way below the poverty line.</para>
<para>The $2 billion being spent on Christmas Island at the moment is the most expensive way to deliver a system for vetting refugees coming to this country from extraordinary circumstances. Senator Hanson-Young has put forward the much more cogent, humane and cheaper options that the Greens would pursue there.</para>
<para>Overseas aid languishes at 0.33 per cent of gross national income, and the government’s target is 0.5 per cent by the year 2015, when it should be one per cent. Included in that aid is $760 million, or some proportion of that, committed by the government at Copenhagen for helping poorer countries in our neighbourhood and elsewhere tackle their own problems with climate change. This was taken out of our aid budget, against the United Nations’ wishes, instead of coming from other funds.</para>
<para>Now we have a childcare rebate pegged at $7,500—that is $500 less per child for eligible parents—which saves only $86 million in an area where there is a need for an injection of funds to meet the quality performance that government quite rightly is now putting into the area. But it is an area that is being neglected and squeezed because the government is applying the squeeze. The Greens see that as a basic need for parents and children across this country if the country is going to have the future it should have.</para>
<para>I might note here some of the other innovations which do not strictly come into the budget speeches of the government or the opposition but which the Greens have initiated in this place in recent years and which we are proud of but which have been knocked off because the big parties simply will not move in the region. One is euthanasia legislation, backed by more than 80 per cent of the Australian populace. Even when I moved to restore the territories’ right—the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory—to legislate in this area, again both the big parties opposed it. Another step was legislation to ensure that Australians are not involved in aiding the Japanese killer whaling fleets of the south—opposed by both parties. Container deposit legislation has had no chance in here under either coalition or Labor governments. Senator Milne’s national feed-in tariff, which would be a great boon to renewable energy, is not seeing the light of day despite experts in the field and business calling for this innovation, which other countries have had for years. A referendum on the republic gained great applause at the Prime Minister’s 2020 forum but there has been no action there at all. Truth in political advertising, which has been proposed by the Greens, was voted down by both the big political parties—that speaks for itself. I referred to high-speed rail earlier. There was the proposal that junk food advertising be banned in children’s TV viewing hours—the scourge of obesity cuts across the health and lifespan of increasing numbers of Australian citizens but, ‘no’ say the big parties to a simple move towards offsetting obesity by banning junk food advertising aimed at children in children’s TV viewing hours.</para>
<para>Yesterday I brought forward legislation to give citizens a far better go in the banking system, including to prohibit the rip-off $2 which banks charge at ATMs to citizens from pensioners right through if they happen to go to an ATM which is not that of their own bank. The legislation requires basic no-cost banking services for people who have simple banking needs wherever they might be in this country. Also, of course, there is the 26 weeks paid parental leave with super, which the Greens not only have before this parliament but will continue to promote, because that is at best standard fare in similar countries around the world. It is every parent’s and every child’s right in this nation in 2010.</para>
<para>I note tonight that the coalition is about to extend the threat to the Australian Public Service with a freeze for two years on new public service jobs. Imagine the incentive that will be for young people who have aspired to study hard and gain themselves a place in the service of the nation when we have an Abbott government saying, ‘If we get in, your road will be blocked now for at least the next two years.’ I quote from the opposition’s shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, on ABC TV’s <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> as recently as April—apparently not understanding that there are 200-plus members of parliament here who do not bake bread, who do not fill potholes and who are not serving in Afghanistan—slinging off at the Public Service, without which this country would not be what it is and who work in the country’s interest. This sneering by the coalition had Mr Hockey saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There are 5,000 people in the Department of Health in Canberra and they don’t treat one patient—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There’s 5,000 people in the Department of Education and they don’t teach one pupil.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The threat of the axe hangs above public servants right across this country. There are 2,000 facing it in the current Labor budget, but that will extend to tens of thousands if an Abbott government is elected. The voters of the ACT in particular, but also in my home state of Tasmania, which has a very healthy public service, will be looking carefully at that threat because it cuts right across their future employment and the employment of their children.</para>
<para>There has arisen to public notice in the last few days a wonderful opportunity for this government if it will take it—that is, to end the many decades of contention about the fate of the great forests of south-east New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. There is a current collapse of that industry. It is due to a glut of wood from around the world. It has been predicted by the analysts, including Judith Ajani from the Australian National University, for many years. It has arrived. The industry is in such a parlous state that it has asked the Greens in Tasmania to meet with it in council to find some way forward. This is a remarkable opportunity to do as Labor Premier Geoff Gallop, following on the work of his Liberal predecessor in Western Australia, did in 2004. When the industry was restructured 29 national parks were created. They are now a huge boon for jobs and productivity in the south-west region of Western Australia. The contention, which pitted people so much against each other, was taken out of that issue. I note that over 80 per cent of Australians in all opinion polls want the end of the destruction of our great native forests and their wildlife. Here is an opportunity for the Rudd government to work with the three south-east states of Australia to indeed achieve a historic outcome for a very small, I believe, outlay which will be in the interests of that industry and, of course, in the interests of Australia’s heirloom forests going on into the future.</para>
<para>As we head for the election, the Greens have a very proud record of responsibility, of taking government proposals in this place and treating them genuinely, of working hard on them and of getting better outcomes. Unlike the coalition, we are not simply naysayers. We do not block simply for the sake of blocking. We are not simply oppositionists, as the coalition is. We believe that if you say no to something you should come up with a better alternative. That is our credo and we will continue to do that. We have a long-sided view for the security of this nation and its future. That is why we are the experts, with the only standing positive proposal on climate change before this parliament.</para>
<para>We will go to the election with a fresh and alternative but very progressive and economically sound outlook and a raft of policies for the people of Australia to consider. We will continue in our role in the Senate to be responsible and economically forward thinking, and we will do so should we win seats in the lower house. Post election, we commit to negotiating responsibly for better outcomes with whichever government is elected. We will go to the people of Australia with the policies I have put forward tonight and more. We look forward to this exercise in democracy and a greater green presence in this parliament—and not least in this Senate, the constructive backstop of democracy for the Australian people.</para>

<para>—It is a great privilege to provide Family First’s budget-in-reply speech. On Tuesday night the Treasurer delivered a budget which was all smiles on the outside but, beneath the surface, it was hiding a dark underbelly. The budget might be more aptly called a gangland budget—smiles on the surface but a dark underbelly. It is a budget that promises financial responsibility but abandons its responsibility to ordinary, hardworking Australians—or, as the Rudd government calls them, working families.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Family First welcomes the news that the budget figures are better than last year. We are pleased that the return to a surplus will come three years earlier than expected. But the question is: at what price has this come? Where are the cuts and what are the clawbacks the Rudd government has forced onto the Australian people? Fiscal responsibility is more than just balancing the numbers; it is knowing where to spend and knowing where to cut. We need to ask if the government has got its priorities right. The answer is a clear no, because the Rudd government has ripped into some of the most important items for ordinary Australians while looking after its own den.</para>
<para>Firstly, the Rudd government’s budget has ripped into child care. That is right: our kids; our future. It has ripped into our kids and their parents. Of course, this means that the government has abandoned its pledge to help its ‘working families’ when it comes to accessible and affordable child care. It has done this by slashing the childcare rebate and putting mums and dads out of pocket by an extra $278 per child per year. For a family of two children, this means that the family budget will be worse off by more than $500. Any parent who pays more than $57.70 in childcare fees per day for five days a week will be worse off under this budget announced by the Rudd government. It is a kick in the guts to mums and dads who are already struggling to pay their childcare bills as it is. What is more, on top of this, the childcare rebate will no longer be indexed to the CPI like it has been in the past. This means that, as the childcare expenses go up and up each year, Australian families will be left more and more out of pocket. Instead of listening to the recommendations of the Henry tax review which suggest giving low-income families a 90 per cent subsidy for child care, the government has gone out and done the exact opposite, by hiking up the childcare costs for those who depend on it most.</para>
<para>This latest attack on working families comes only a few weeks after the government broke its election promise by scrapping plans to build 260 childcare centres. These 260 new childcare centres were badly needed because there are already many families who have trouble finding an affordable spot for their kids. The Prime Minister claims he is committed to helping working families. But how are working families supposed to go to work if there are not enough childcare centres to look after their kids at an affordable price? If childcare is too expensive for them to afford, how are they supposed to be ‘working families’? We know where that promise of 260 new childcare centres has gone. It has gone to the Labor election promise graveyard.</para>
<para>The second dark underbelly of the budget is housing affordability. Family First believes that the government has missed the mark when it comes to addressing this core issue for ordinary Australians of housing affordability. People trying to enter the property market will find it just as hard to buy a house, as the government has done nothing to make housing more affordable. Housing affordability is a crisis that is getting worse and worse and is being compounded by the fact that the government does not seem to care.</para>
<para>Housing prices in my home city of Melbourne went up 28 per cent in the 12 months to March this year, and in the past eight months interest rates have gone up by 1½ per cent. Put in real terms, this means that first home buyers who could not afford to get into the market last year have had to stump up $98,000 more to afford the average median home this year. And those who were under mortgage stress last year are now under even greater pressure and have to pay $270 more to the banks each month. What about the great Australian dream? It is the great Australian dream to own your home, and we should be doing everything we can to make it easier for people to live that dream. Instead, we have a government that does not care about housing affordability—and this budget does not give any hope to first home buyers.</para>
<para>I would liked to have seen the government look at the idea of letting first home buyers access part of their superannuation to put a deposit on a house so that they can at least get a foot in the door and have that great Australian dream of owning their home. Instead of making people wait 40 years until they can access their super, this money should be allowed to be partly put to another good use like owning your own home. This would not cost the taxpayer any money in government funding but would help go towards solving a housing crisis that is spiralling out of control. This would be a lifeline to thousands of young families desperately trying to escape the rent rut.</para>
<para>The third dark underbelly of the budget is medical costs. Family First is at a loss to understand the government’s decision to increase the net medical expenses tax offset from $1,500 to $2,000. It sounds like an increase but it is a slug on Australian families and their medical costs. I understand that some costs need to be reined in if we are to get this budget back into surplus but why would you go out and increase basic medical costs for those who need treatment the most? Why would you go out and make those people who are already paying the most for medical bills pay even more? The Rudd government has done this in a mean and tricky way by raising the net medical expenses tax offset. It sounds like it is better; it is worse. It does not make any sense. It is a heartless policy that slugs the sick and unwell.</para>
<para>What makes it all the worse is that, while the government is leaving families short-changed with their medical bills, the Prime Minister has given himself an extra 86 staff on top of the 65 additional staff he took on in last year’s budget. How many more people do you need? It just stinks to think that this is the second year in a row that Prime Minister Rudd has increased his staffing levels by more than 60 people. It is a real smack in the face to all Australians who are struggling to stay afloat when they see the Prime Minister feathering his own nest. At a time when Australians are told to cut back and make do, this excess by the Prime Minister is obscene.</para>
<para>The government cries poor and says it does not have the money to keep the net medical expenses tax offset as it is but it has no problems splashing out $18 million of taxpayers’ money to boost the Prime Minister’s office budget. I find the government’s priorities in this gangland budget amazingly warped. I find the government’s priorities all the more disturbing given that it is willing to spend cash on itself but when it comes to our veterans community this government is once again silent and pretends it has empty pockets.</para>
<para>Once again there is no mention in the budget of plans to implement a more appropriate and equitable indexation arrangement for the military superannuation schemes. It is a national disgrace the way this government has chosen to treat our veterans community and failed to recognise the unique nature of military service—and I think the government is going to get a whacking at the ballot box at the next election.</para>
<para>Family First does recognise that the budget allocates more spending on health reform and it is certainly a good thing that more money is going into this area of health; however, it is not enough just to pour money into health and leave it at that. We have to make sure that we are spending this money wisely. We need to get the best bang for our buck and ensure that this money actually goes towards fixing the health system once and for all—not just splashing it out on ineffective and useless reforms.</para>
<para>I still believe we need to be looking at the basics—that is, how many doctors, how many dentists, how many nurses, how many beds, how many other resources and how many other health professionals do we need per thousand people or per thousand families? This is what we have got to start to see. Once we work that out we need to look at whether there are enough doctors, dentists, nurses, beds, other resources and other health professionals in each region. Rather than just throwing money at it, surely we cannot continue to allow things to happen where we are turning away thousands of our young kids from studying medicine when we keep on importing doctors. It is ridiculous.</para>
<para>We should do this demand and supply planning immediately and urgently. Then we can look at this on a city basis, on a regional basis, on an outer suburban basis, on a country area basis and then on a state basis. Then you can work out whether we have got real health reform. The money needs to go directly to where the shortages are so that we stop living in a first-world country with a substandard health system.</para>
<para>This budget does not do enough for families and it does not deliver on the key areas which affect ordinary Australians. This budget is disappointing and Family First look forward to sitting down with the government and working together with them on making it work better for all Australians.</para>

<para>—I rise tonight to pay tribute to the work of St Vincent de Paul, especially in my home state of South Australia. More particularly, I want to draw the attention of all Australians to its national fundraising campaign, the CEO Sleepout. As I am someone raised and schooled in the Catholic tradition, St Vinnies, as perhaps the most identifiable Catholic charity, has long been on my landscape, particularly in its work for the homeless in South Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Because of the depth and breadth of the Adelaide parklands and their heavy use by pedestrians and cyclists, homelessness is perhaps more readily apparent in Adelaide than in many other places. It is hard to ignore the scruffy camps, the makeshift swags of old blankets and cardboard and the blue plastic carry bags stashed under the bushes while the owners move around the city in search of food and lodging.</para>
<para>As I am sure you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, it is hard to ignore the people drifting across the lawns of Whitmore Square as evening draws near—homeless men hoping to get an early place in the queue for a bed and hot meal at the Vincentian Centre. The Vincentian Centre is a special work of the St Vincent de Paul Society in South Australia. The St Vinnies Night Shelter, as it was known for a long time, first opened in May 1961 and it has never closed its doors since. The new Vincentian Centre was built in 2002-03 at a cost of just under $3 million.</para>
<para>The centre is funded by the Saint Vincent de Paul Society South Australia Inc., by the South Australian Department of Families and Communities under the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, and by corporate and private sponsors. Professional staff—I had the opportunity just recently to meet them—deliver services to the homeless, and volunteers play a vital role in supporting the shelter in areas such as food preparation, maintenance and cleaning duties. The Vincentian Centre can accommodate up to 49 homeless men from the ages of 18 years up every night of the year and it also provides a range of services such as crisis accommodation, meals, showers, assessment needs, comprehensive case management services, referrals to other organisations and social support.</para>
<para>During the 2008-09 financial year the Vincentian Centre provided 9,531 bed spaces, 2,698 breakfasts, 6,573 evening meals and 4,797 suppers. St Vinnies also runs Fred’s Van—as you would be aware, Mr President—a mobile food service for homeless people comprising four vans operating in seven Adelaide locations: Adelaide city, Salisbury, Elizabeth, Gawler, Christies Beach, Semaphore and Ferryden Park.</para>
<para>The causes of homelessness make for a depressing litany of social ills. There is family or relationship breakdown, drug and/or alcohol addiction, mental health issues, income support issues, lack of access to affordable and safe housing, lack of living skills and gambling addiction—indeed a wide range of issues. The Vincentian Centre seeks to assist clients to address their problems in all of these areas. Homelessness is tsunami-like in proportion and charities like St Vinnies cannot even begin to address the magnitude of the problem without help and support from government, the private sector and the general public.</para>
<para>The mining magnate Lang Hancock once said that the best way of helping the poor was not to become one of them. I never took too much notice of Lang Hancock and in this instance he was clearly wrong. On Thursday 17 June 2010 the St Vinnies major homeless fundraiser, the CEO Sleepout, will take place in capital cities across Australia. Despite Lang Hancock’s exhortation, the CEO Sleepout invites people at the upper end of the socioeconomic scale to become one of the poor for the night to experience directly for themselves the humiliation, the desperation and the privation of homelessness.</para>
<para>Money is raised, certainly, but it is hoped that the people who participate go out into the community with fresh insights to drive change and progress on this very serious issue. The CEO Sleepout is a really creative way of engaging our business and community leaders, helping those of us who are fortunate enough to confront homelessness and destitution firsthand to understand just what the realities are. It is only by becoming one of the homeless ourselves, by experiencing it ourselves, that we can even begin to understand. It is only by truly understanding that we can start to put together truly meaningful solutions.</para>
<para>There are a range of CEOs and community leaders sleeping out on 17 June in Adelaide. I do not have time to acknowledge all of these South Australian participants, but they include, in no particular order: Ian Stone, the managing director of RAA; Claude Piscioneri, the district manager of ANZ Bank; Kristin Jeffery, the sales manager for Scott Salisbury Homes; Leesa Vlahos, the very new member for Taylor in South Australia; Stuart Price, the CEO of Kelly and Co. Lawyers; Philip Rundle, the managing director of CB Richard Ellis; Tom Kenyon, the recently re-elected member for Newland in South Australia; Rainer Jozeps, the chief executive of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra; Jenny Brinkworth, the director of Catholic Communications for the Archdiocese of Adelaide; Tony Sherbon, the chief executive of the Department of Health; Matthew Evins, the managing director of Banner Hardware; Richard Ryan, the chairman of Editure Limited; John Haren, of course, the CEO of St Vincent de Paul itself; and last, but by no means least, Vickie Chapman, the member for Bragg and my local member of parliament. For those of you who do not know, she is a member of the Liberal Party.</para>
<para>In the case of homelessness, I know all sides of politics are committed to addressing this critical issue. This is beyond politics; it is an issue that touches all of us and our common humanity. I am delighted to be sponsoring South Australian Liberal parliamentarian Vickie Chapman’s sleep-out. I think it is terrific that she is doing this and she has my respect and support—moral and financial, but not political! They say the most intense hatreds are not between political parties but within them. Mr President, I can see you smiling there.</para>

<para>—I rise tonight to acknowledge the passing of an Australian who may not exactly be a household name but whose mark on many Australians has been very significant. In particular, his mark on the city of Canberra is very heavy indeed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The person I refer to is Sir Laurence Macdonald Muir, who died on 21 April this year, a man who played a notable part in the development of Canberra, particularly the Canberra business sector and many of its national institutions, including, incidentally, the building in which we now sit. The <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> in November 1979 in fact described him as, ‘The man to be considered the shaper of Canberra’s future’.</para>
<para>He was born in Yallourn, Victoria in 1925. He later indicated that his parents were ‘migrant battlers’ who sacrificed much to give him and his three siblings a good education. That education was gained at Scotch College, where he was obviously showed talent, being made school captain in 1942. Like many other young Australians at the time, he served for four years in the Royal Australian Navy. He gained a law degree at Melbourne University and was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1950.</para>
<para>Having worked for a firm of stockbrokers during university vacations, he was offered a position with the firm on the day of his admission. It is perhaps a reflection of his practical business sense that he weighed up the security of the underwriting firm against the ‘insecurity but glowing prospects of the bar’. He opted for the security of underwriting. For the next 30 years he was a leading sharebroker, specialising in underwriting major capital raising for large Australian companies. It was this specialised knowledge and background that in fact proved very helpful in the development of Canberra’s business potential.</para>
<para>He had a number of major goals that he set himself throughout his life, some of which will have touched people in this place. For example, in the mid-seventies he was challenged by Sister Fabian, the then head of the Sisters of Charity at St Vincent’s, to raise $13 million to build St Vincent’s Private Hospital. Urged on by the sister, who used the phrase, ‘God will find a way, Mr Muir,’ the goal was achieved by persuading the state government to provide a government guarantee, thereby making the loan a 30-20 semi-governmental, which the institutions were happy to subscribe to at a rate the hospital could handle. The hospital was indeed built.</para>
<para>In the seventies he chaired a two-day conference of independent school headmasters and Catholic school representatives, resulting in the formation of the National Council of Independent Schools. In 1980 he chaired a two-day conference in Canberra involving federal ministers, opposition spokespeople, trade union leaders, Treasury officials, academics and 40 business leaders. The agenda explored the need for a business roundtable to be available for consultation with the government, and the result was the Australian Business Council, formed about 20 months later.</para>
<para>He was a man who set himself plenty of challenges and met, it seems, every one of them. In October 1979 the then Mr Muir established the Canberra Development Board for the federal government and as its chairman for eight years he was responsible for stimulating the private sector growth of the ACT economy. During this time he assisted the government in attracting and staging the IAAF World Cup in athletics in Canberra.</para>
<para>Described as an instinctive lateral thinker, he said that his work satisfaction came from ‘creating something that was not there before’. That certainly seems to have been the case in relation to his role in developing the private sector of the ACT. Although he was based in Melbourne, Sir Laurence was a staunch advocate for and promoter of private enterprise development in Canberra. He felt that ‘what is good for the capital is good for Australia,’ and that ‘Australians who did not live in Canberra should nevertheless feel a sense of belonging and a sense of pride in their national capital’—never a truer word was spoken.</para>
<para>In those days, Sir Laurence indicated that one of Canberra’s major disadvantages was its economic dependence on the public sector. He was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> as saying, ‘If the ratio in Australia at that time was 30 per cent public sector to 70 per cent private sector, Canberra was almost exactly the other way’. While we have not yet got a complete reversal of that percentage to 70 per cent private and 30 per cent public in the ACT we have come a very long way down that path, thanks in large part to the Canberra Development Board of which Sir Laurence Muir was a long time chair. It is interesting to note with current comments about population sustainability that he forecast a population for Canberra one day of 750,000 people.</para>
<para>I mentioned that he was a member of the Parliament House Construction Authority, and he was for many years the chairman of the Artworks Advisory Committee of that establishment. As a result he was a person very largely responsible for the development of the very fine collection of mainly 20th century art, which is a feature of this building and which I am sure every member of this place enjoys samples of in his or her suite.</para>
<para>Between 1981 and his death, Sir Laurie, as he was known to many people, served on a range of eminent boards. He served, for example, on the Council of the Australian National University and was the inaugural chair of the Canberra Development Board. He worked in 1986 with Sir Ian McLennan and Mr Baillieu Myer and the Minister for Science at the time, the Hon. Barry Jones, to establish the National Science and Technology Centre, now called Questacon. In 1988 the centre was built in the Parliamentary Triangle, enabling science to take its place with the arts and the law. The Board of the National Science and Technology Centre was asked by the government to take hands-on science to every part of Australia, an important task for the development of scientific endeavour and learning in Australia. Certainly, that role was amply achieved. He also worked with Professor Michael Gore, the CEO of Questacon, to develop corporate sponsorship, which was very successful.</para>
<para>Sir Laurie came into contact with many amazing people during his life and he wrote of some of them, including such people as Sir Reginald Ansett, Sir Edward ‘Weary’ Dunlop and Lyn Swinburne, in his book <inline font-style="italic">Some Inspirational People</inline>. In the foreword to that book he wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">They are all great achievers who have enriched my life and the lives of others. It has been a privilege to share experiences with each of them and to watch them succeed.</para>
<para class="block">They have much in common; in particular they are linked by qualities of dedication and passion.</para>
<para class="block">Hopefully their stories will help to inspire others and in particular will be of interest to young Australians.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Ironically, the words used by Sir Laurence Muir about other people could well describe him. He dedicated himself passionately to many important things and succeeded in providing a great many institutions and other facilities still enjoyed today by the people of Canberra and Australia. I trust that the young people of Canberra and indeed Australia will note his achievements with pride and thanks and today, with his passing, pay tribute to the benefits that he has conferred on them.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak tonight on the terrific efforts of volunteers around Australia and, in particular, those in Tasmania. As senators are aware, this week is National Volunteer Week, a time to recognise the fantastic efforts of all of our volunteers. The theme for this year is ‘Volunteering: now, more than ever’, so I feel that it is fitting to mention some of the volunteers that Tasmania is privileged to have within our community, particularly those who have contributed over many years. Australian communities have over 5.2 million volunteers who give up their time to help others, all of whom are essential to our society, especially to our smaller communities. These volunteers are estimated to contribute over 710 million hours of volunteer assistance—a truly remarkable effort, for nothing more than positively contributing to their communities. In order to give a full understanding of what volunteers mean to their respective organisations, I have gathered information about some wonderful Tasmanians to share with you this evening.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Firstly, there is Tasma Lapham, who has been volunteering for over 80 hours each week to assist the North Launceston Football Club. This commitment dates back to 1976. Her initial involvement began with one son playing junior football with the club. Since those early days when Tasma and others like her rolled up their sleeves and began to work for no monetary return, this proud club has grown from a club struggling financially to a strong and stable club with membership in the Tasmanian state-wide league. From Tasma’s first days making sandwiches for over 80 players, she has added many other facets to her input at the club. Tasma has now served for 15 years as a member of the board, but this does not excuse her from catering duties at the end of the final training session or her weekly Wednesday bingo management duties at the Launceston country club. As with each of the people I draw to your attention tonight, Tasma does not expect anything in return for nourishing these young, sometimes disadvantaged, players and helping them through difficult times in their lives. This lady does not measure success in premierships. She takes pride in what these young men achieve on and off the field. To Tasma, friends and friendships are highly valued, and she feels that the volunteers get more out of helping the players and the club than they ever give. She is a true example of the incredible amount of nourishment and support that is given to our community by thousands of volunteers.</para>
<para>Who would have thought that one of Tasmania’s biggest hearts would beat in tiny Alberton in the state’s north-east, which has a population of only four people? Jeffrey Harper has two passions: the local Lions club and Community Transport Services Tasmania. This man has been assisting the frail, disabled and elderly to get out of their homes and into the community for over 12 years. Sometimes, three or four times a week, Jeff will drive 34 kilometres to get the community transport vehicle and then drive these people to wherever they need to go. It is sometimes as far as Hobart, making this a round trip of more than 520 kilometres. Such friendship and care for the clients is mirrored only by the pride that he takes in maintaining the CTST vehicles, which is an example of the way that volunteers such as Jeff are invaluable to Australian communities. It is people such as Jeff who help to make our communities strong.</para>
<para>The president of the Launceston General Hospital central auxiliary is certainly following in the family’s footsteps. Margaret Moore AM is proud to relate that five generations of her family have volunteered in this organisation. Margaret and her husband, Colin, currently work with a team of over 80 like-minded individuals whose primary goal is to raise funds to purchase equipment which improves the care and treatment of patients at the Launceston General Hospital. With a turnover of approximately $500,000 last year, the input from Margaret and her co-volunteers is highly significant and an extremely valuable contribution to society.</para>
<para>While we are focusing on some individuals and their stories, one who comes to mind is our own federal Labor candidate for Bass, Geoff Lyons. He reminds me that when people wish to assist others in society they are often not limited to one particular area. Many volunteers find themselves donating their time and skills to a variety of organisations. Geoff Lyons is a prime example of such socially motivated people. Listing Geoff Lyons’s achievements within the Bass community in this forum would be far too difficult. At last count, he has volunteered for at least 16 groups in the last 12 months, from working with sporting clubs such as surf lifesaving, netball and football through to being a member of the board of the aged-care facility Peace Haven as well as being a justice of the peace. It is not only in the last 12 months that Geoff Lyons has been volunteering. He has had many years of association with volunteer groups. His involvement is not superficial, unlike his opponent’s. His knowledge of his community and its challenges is why he will make an outstanding federal member for Bass after the next election.</para>
<para>It is not only the older generations of Australians that are volunteering. Many of our younger generations are also getting involved. The Rural Youth Organisation of Tasmania is an excellent example of a group of young people, all between the ages of 15 and 30. This group puts together an agricultural field day every year, which runs for three days. It is called Agfest and was in fact held last week, from 6 May to 8 May inclusive. Agfest boasts an impressive 700-plus stalls and over 75,000 visitors each year. This is an outstanding effort for a group of young people, clearly showing the dedication and hard work of volunteering that they all contribute in their spare time. It is not only this but the fact that these young people have the chance, through their volunteer work, to gain lifelong skills and friendships. It is people like these young volunteers who help to strengthen our communities and make them special. No matter how big or small—whether it is reading to children at the local school, visiting the elderly in nursing homes or helping out at the local football or netball club—every effort counts and is appreciated greatly.</para>
<para>Through these examples it is clear that helping our mate is still dominant in today’s society, and these people do so with enthusiasm and pride. During this week especially, it is important to pay special attention to these efforts and to acknowledge the wonderful work that these volunteers in each of our communities give to our country and to our state. I would encourage more Australians, and in particular more Tasmanians, to give of their time.</para>

<para>—The answer to the honorable senator’s question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The costs for household access will be determined by wholesale costs set by NBN Tasmania and retail service providers that use the NBN in order to supply broadband services. NBN Tasmania Limited is currently in negotiations with retail service providers on product and service arrangements. Ultimately retail service providers will set retail prices in a competitive market.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The costs of the rollout will be met by NBN Tasmania Limited. NBN Tasmania Limited is a subsidiary of NBN Co and has been established to build and operate the NBN in Tasmania. It will receive equity contributions from the Australian Government through NBN Co and negotiations for the vending in of assets held by the State of Tasmania and Aurora Energy are continuing. A $100 million equity injection towards the cost of the rollout of the Stages 1, 2 and 3 was announced on 1 March 2010.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Construction costs incurred by NBN Tasmania Limited under the stage one rollout agreement to 31 December 2009 are approximately $3.707 million. Final costs for the first stage in Tasmania will be determined once the competitive tender processes conducted by Aurora Energy and NBN Tasmania Limited are completed. Legal costs associated with the NBN in Tasmania will also not be known until the tender processes are complete. However to 31 December 2009, the Department has incurred approximately $510,962 in legal costs and $21,129 for the Australian Government Solicitor for advice associated with the negotiations with the Tasmanian Government and Aurora Energy and the establishment of NBN Tasmania Limited.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has incurred the following costs to 31 December 2009 to establish NBN Tasmania Limited and conduct negotiations with the Tasmanian Government and Aurora Energy: approximately $266,554 on commercial consultants, KPMG; approximately $277,623 on technical consultants, Consultel IT&amp;T: and approximately $510,962 on legal consultants, Minter Ellison.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>200,000 Tasmanian premises will be connected by fibre optic cable and the remaining premises will be connected via wireless and satellite technologies. The NBN will be rolled out in Tasmania over the next five years. </para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>NBN Tasmania and Aurora Energy are currently conducting tender processes for services and resources to supply the rollout. In order to achieve the best value for taxpayers’ money it is not appropriate to release the funding allocation for the Tasmania rollout.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>The Government entered into negotiations with the Tasmanian Government based on the advice of the Panel of Experts, which was engaged to advise the Government on the previous Request for Proposals process.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>The first stage rollout in Tasmania has commenced. The communities of Smithton, Scottsdale and Midway Point will be the first to receive optical fibre broadband connections. Corning Cable Systems is the successful tenderer to supply fibre optic cable -- backhaul and FTTP -- for stage one. John Holland is the successful tenderer to construct the backhaul and FTTP, and BSA the successful tenderer to install the cable drops. The backhaul links to Midway Point and Smithton are now completed and work continues on the backhaul to Scottsdale. Construction work will be underway in the three stage 1 communities in March 2010. The first three retail service providers (Primus, iiNet and Internode) who will provide services over the NBN were announced on 13 March 2010.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>NBN Tasmania Limited has not conducted a take-up study.</para>
</item>
<item label="(10)">
<para>In 2008 the Tasmanian Government submitted a commercial-in-confidence proposal to the Government as part of the National Broadband Network Request for Proposals (RFP) process. The Tasmanian Government proposal is covered by confidentiality provisions under the RFP and will not be released.</para>
</item>
<item label="(11)">
<para>No.</para>
</item>
<item label="(12)">
<para>The Government recognises that affordability is an important factor that will drive take-up of services on the NBN, and in turn viability.   As a wholesale-only network, the NBN will deliver genuine competition, choice and affordable services supporting the future needs of Australia. Pricing on the NBN will need to have careful regard to existing price points in the market.  As in today’s market, there will be a range of plans and price points to meet the needs of home and business customers.</para>
</item>
<item label="(13)">
<para>NBN Tasmania Limited has been established to build and operate the NBN in Tasmania. As the network assets are progressively built, commissioned, tested and accepted the ownership of those assets transfers to NBN Tasmania. NBN Tasmania currently has a General Manager, an Executive Director and five non-executive directors with several specialists seconded from NBN Co to lead the program management, commercial, industry engagement and operations activities. In addition there is a core team of up to 20 people in Aurora (as agent for NBN Tasmania) performing the network design and managing the supply and construction activities of sub-contractors. Professional services are provided by Minter Ellison as interim Company Secretary.</para>

<para>As stated in the answer to SI-23, the research was preliminary and the data are not suitable for publication.

<item label="(2)">
<para>CSIRO does not have a database equipped to facilitate a search of our publications based on the disclaimer used. If a disclaimer is used on a CSIRO research report, it is used to reflect the specific circumstances of the work undertaken and is developed in negotiation with the collaborators on the project. As a result, a manual search across multiple areas of CSIRO would be required to ascertain the reports relevant to this question. Following such a search, a manual review of each document would need to be undertaken in order to explain the material differences, as requested in part ‘b’ of this question. This process would require a significant diversion of CSIRO’s staff resources.</para>
