                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  Before my comments were interrupted by other parliamentary business in the last session I was speaking about Britney and how after her school graduation last year she and her mother became in need of additional further support after school. Her mother works as a nurse and she needs more support hours so that she can look after Britney and provide for the rest of the family. Most of that support comes from the state, but it does highlight the need for the Prime Minister to stop her politically driven fights with the states and seek bilateral agreements as everyone needs to be on board to drive change and deliver for all those with disabilities such as Britney, Mitchell and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout this debate, the government has repeatedly suggested that they are the party of the NDIS because the NDIS represents Labor values. But I remind the parliament that abandoning those in need is not the policy of any political party. The coalition supported the work of the Productivity Commission. We supported the $1 billion in the last budget and the five launch sites, and the agreement for the New South Wales rollout, and we support this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition has also demonstrated his personal commitment to those with disabilities by dedicating the 2012 Pollie Pedal charity bike ride to Carers Australia; $540,000 was raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An economy well managed by the federal government can deliver the NDIS in the time frame, but not this government. They talk about their values with the usual sanctimony, but in the end their spending decisions have damaged the ability of this nation to have an NDIS on time, and they must be held to account. Talk is cheap; the NDIS is not, and it will fall to a better government to deliver—and that better government, I hope, will be delivered soon when the Australian people reject the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank those constituents of mine who have come forward to tell me of their circumstances and to impress upon me their needs. What I would say is that under Tony Abbott we want to deliver the change required, but because of the wasteful spending of this government there is now more spending on interest payments each year than would be required to fully fund the NDIS. This Labor government has spent beyond the means of this country, and their recklessness is now holding back a comprehensive and effective NDIS. To cover up their inability to fund this worthwhile and necessary NDIS, they have picked fights with state governments to develop a smokescreen and deceive the people of this country. Australians should choose a Tony Abbott led government at the election to get this job done.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MATHESON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  Today I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012 and the positive benefits it will have for the people of Macarthur. I believe this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has ever been and that ever will be spoken about in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since becoming the member for Macarthur I have fought hard to support the charity groups and organisations in my electorate who support those living with a disability and their families. These families should have access to the funding and support services they need to ensure the best quality of life possible for their loved ones. The NDIS will provide this much-needed support by providing the funding and support services they need. We hope this will in turn help them join the workforce and become active members of our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS will empower individuals and reduce red tape for people living with a disability and their carers. It will provide funding to individuals and organisations to help people with a disability participate more fully in our communities through things like aids, equipment, supported accommodation and personal care. It is my strong belief that the financial support and assistance for these people living with a disability should not be the responsibility of the parents and carers, who already provide hands-on support to their loved ones 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The added pressure of fundraising for equipment and fighting for more services and financial support should not be left to these families who have so much on their plates already. The sad truth is that the lack of funding and support can put even more pressure and stress on these families and sometimes pull them apart. The NDIS will provide funding in the form of individual support packages for people living with a disability and the possibility of some block funding for different groups or organisations to support these Australians and their families. In my electorate the cracks are definitely showing. It is very obvious that our current system of support for people living with a disability in this country is not working. In Macarthur, people living with a disability and their families are relying heavily on the support of several charities, community groups and organisations who work hard to continually raise money to provide this vital support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many times in this place I have mentioned these groups and the fantastic work they do in my community to help those in need. These include KU Starting Points, an educational support organisation that offers a range of early intervention programs for children with disabilities and their families; the Right Start Foundation, a group of local parents who raise money and awareness to provide support for local families living with Down syndrome; the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, an organisation dedicated to improving health care for every child living in Macarthur by raising money and advocating for children's health services and research across the region; Society 389, an organisation that provides financial support and assistance for families of children with disabilities and special needs; Macarthur Disability Services, a not-for-profit organisation that provides support for people living with a disability, people with a mental illness, the aged, families and carers in the Macarthur region; Macarthur Temporary Family Care, an organisation that provides support and high-quality care programs for children of families in crisis and respite care for children and adults who have a physical or intellectual disability; NOVA Employment, offering specialist job-seeking assistance and post-placement support for people living with a disability; and Northcott Disability Services, one of New South Wales's leading service providers for people living with a disability, providing support and services direct to their clients as well as carers and family members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these groups provide vital support to residents in my community and rely heavily on community fundraisers, state and federal government grants and hardworking volunteers to do the great work they do in my electorate. Many of these groups have played an active role in the Every Australian Counts campaign to raise awareness of the NDIS in Macarthur. I have attended many of these events and heard firsthand from those families who believe the NDIS would have a huge impact on their lives. While speaking about these groups in parliament I have also shared the stories of many children and families in my electorate who have relied on their support. One of these children was Brittney McKenna, who was born with the heartbreaking disease spinal muscular atrophy. Sadly, Brittney passed away in 2008 at just nine years of age. When I met with Brittney's parents last year they mentioned the lack of funding and respite for families living with SMA and the added stress this caused to their family. There was limited support offered to Brittney's family and no respite because she was classified as 'too high medical support'. Brittney's mum was proficient in all her medical needs including her IV medications. In between all the years spent in hospital, the 41 surgeries and the 24-hour intensive care for their daughter, Debbie and Andrew also had to do their own fundraising for equipment and home modifications to support Brittney. They told me that life by the hospital bed included a constant struggle with red tape, bureaucracy, budgets and politics in an attempt to get some support. My hope for the NDIS is that no family in Macarthur or anywhere else in Australia should ever have to experience what this family went through whilst trying to care for a sick child. Brittney's longest single admission in hospital was 21 months. Her dad, Andrew, was working interstate to support the family financially and her mum, Debbie, was by her hospital bed 24 hours a day. Their son Liam was passed around family and friends to give him some stability and routine. With the help of the community the family raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to give Brittney the life she deserved. It is no wonder they were left financially, physically and emotionally exhausted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years I have become very close to many families in my electorate who love and support someone with a disability. That is why this issue is very close to my heart. It is no secret that I am a big supporter of the Right Start Foundation, a charity group that supports local families living with Down syndrome. The foundation was started by a group of mums who have children living with Down syndrome. These women continually fight for funding and support and are now raising money to establish Australia's first Down syndrome specific centre in Macarthur to ensure children and families receive all the therapy and support they need for the right start in life. These parents really are an inspirational group of people. Not only do they provide so much love and support for their own children; they work hard to raise awareness and to fundraise to support others living with Down syndrome. My hope is that the NDIS will give these children the support they deserve and greater opportunities to support themselves as they grow older.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another reason the NDIS is very close to my heart is that one of my very own staff members has a son with a disability. Ben Upfill was born with one of the most severe forms of Angelman syndrome, a rare neurogenetic disorder which causes severe intellectual disability, speech impediment, sleep disturbance, unstable jerky movements of the limbs and seizures. Ben's Mum, Carla, his dad, Dave, and siblings, Joel and Olivia, give Ben all the love and support they can as a family to make sure he has the best quality of life possible. Unless you have a child with a severe disability it is hard to imagine what it is like to provide such intensive care to a child at home whilst working to pay the bills and provide for your disabled child and the rest of your family. Just a few years ago the Macarthur charity Society 389 could see the family was in need of a new car to help them transport Ben in his wheelchair. Through a charity night more than $45,000 was raised to buy the family a car to make life a little easier for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My point is that families, like this one, who are caring for a child with a disability, are very lucky to have the support of many charities made up of volunteers to help them raise money to support their children. For some the support of these charities is a godsend, because without them these families would be forced to make a choice between supporting their disabled child and paying the bills and putting food on the table. Unfortunately the resources of these charities and organisations can become quite stretched, with so many people in my community needing their support. That is why the National Disability Insurance Scheme is so important and why it is so important that we get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a new system of support based on need. The person living with the disability and their family or carers need to be at the centre of the scheme and in charge, able to choose the support, aid, equipment, and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme which I wholeheartedly support. The coalition supports the National Disability Insurance Scheme because we know that the current system of support for Australians living with a disability is not working. This is why the concept of the NDIS has gained momentum over the past five years. In my own electorate, groups like Macarthur Disability Services, Northcott Disability Services, Macarthur District Temporary Family Care, Campbelltown, Camden and Wollondilly councils, Sunnyfield Independence, the Macarthur Disability Network and Macarthur Diversity Services have all worked together to raise public awareness about the importance of the scheme and show Macarthur's support for its successful implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October last year I attended the Macarthur NDIS Big DisabiliTEA to hear from these groups and show my support for the NDIS. It was a great day with many families from across my electorate there to share their stories and show their support. Events like this one are very important. Not only did it raise awareness for the scheme but it was to me like a cry for help from these Macarthur families who love their children so much and want to see them given the support they need now and into the future. So many of the parents I spoke to fear what will happen to their children once mum and dad are no longer around to look after them. Yes, many of them have siblings who love them and will take on the role of carer when it is their turn, but it is important that these siblings are given the support they need to carry on this role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the NDIS will give many parents peace of mind that even when they are no longer around to provide for their children the Australian government will ensure they have access to the support services and funding they need. And of course it is not just Macarthur residents who will benefit from the scheme. It is estimated that 7,500 young Australians who require full-time care are currently living in aged-care facilities and more than 700,000 young Australians are being cared for at home by their loved ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many young people and so many Australian families who need our help. It is our job to make sure that they do not slip through the cracks. Perfecting the NDIS gives us an opportunity to do just that. This is why the coalition has supported the initial work by the Productivity Commission, which confirmed that our current system of support simply is not good enough. We support the National Disability Insurance Scheme and believe it requires bipartisan support from both sides of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we supported the $1 billion promised in last year's budget, it was disappointing that this figure fell short of what the Productivity Commission estimated would be needed in the first four years of the scheme by $3 billion. I would hope to see the Treasurer account for this shortfall in his coming budget. The coalition has also supported the five launch sites for the NDIS and the agreement between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales governments for a full statewide rollout after the launch in the Hunter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that the NDIS can be delivered within the time frame recommended by the Productivity Commission by a sensible government that manages it well. We are ready to work with the government to see an NDIS delivered as soon as possible and we believe that we must get this right the first time around, with a very high level of consultation and attention to the detail from now until its full implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So far we have heard very little in regard to how each individual will be assessed and who will be eligible for the scheme. I would like to know if the NDIS is going to extend to those who might look healthy from the outside but are struggling with a terminal illness. For example, in Macarthur there are more than 80 people living with cystic fibrosis, a genetic condition that effects more than 3,000 people in Australia. The condition is life threatening, and daily physio treatment, regular hospital stays and life-threatening lung infections can limit a person suffering from CF and their carers from leading a full and productive life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cystic Fibrosis Australia has put forward a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in regard to the NDIS. In the submission the organisation has asked that the NDIS framework include people living with cystic fibrosis. It has asked that the scheme provide the full range of equipment used by people with CF, including parts and servicing for nebulisers, oxygen saturation machines, mouthpieces and inhalers. They would also like to see the inclusion of non-PBS medicines, both dietary and other supplements, as well as travel and accommodation allowances to attend specialist clinics. The submission pushes for a needs assessment and support service for carers and the inclusion of preventative services such as exercise programs and equipment for CF sufferers. These are just some of the things needed by people living with cystic fibrosis that could be provided under the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also concerned about the eligibility for residents in my electorate who are over 65 years of age. Will they be eligible to benefit from the NDIS? There are many unanswered questions that must be worked through properly. This is why the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. This would lock in all parties and allow us to work through the design and eligibility together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it disappointing that the government has knocked back the coalition's call for bipartisanship on so many occasions. I believe that the implementation of the NDIS should be placed above politics. I think that this is a time when we must come together to ensure that we get it right for all people living with a disability in our electorates. There is no reason for one side of politics to take on such an important piece of legislation on its own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that if we work together we can implement one of the best disability policies in the world, one that ensures no person living with a disability falls through the cracks. If the scheme is to succeed it will need the support of all levels of government in all states and territories across this country. If it is well-implemented, the scheme will ensure people with a disability have the support they need today and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spend a lot of time with families in my electorate who have children living with a disability. I am continuously inspired by their positive attitude and their dedication to breaking down barriers and raising awareness of their child's condition. But no matter how amazing the parent or the child might be, raising a child with additional needs can be extremely challenging and isolating. That is why I believe that it is imperative that we work together on this one, because I want nothing more than the best for my community and those Macarthur families who will benefit from this scheme. I wholeheartedly support a National Disability Insurance Scheme for the people of Macarthur and the people of Australia. I hope that as a parliament we can work together to ensure the scheme is rolled out as effectively and as soon as possible.</span>

                    <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:19</span>):  In addressing the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012, let me begin by giving my wholehearted support to the bill and to the broader underlying principle. I want to speak briefly today across three fronts: the humanity behind the bill; the principles to be enshrined in the bill; and the issue of supported accommodation, which, for those living in the Hastings area as well as across the electorate of Flinders and across Australia, is a critical element of care and treatment for those who have some of the most challenging disabilities that we face in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin by looking at the humanity, with people that I know. There is a young fellow, Tom McGann, whom I have known for over a decade. His situation is that has had:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a neuromuscular disability since birth which means I have never walked and have been in a motorised wheelchair from age 4.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He is now a young adult. He went through mainstream schooling at Mount Martha Primary School and then secondary school. He is a joy to be with and he is an absolute source of pride to his parents. These days, he is studying IT at TAFE and his goal is to have a career in the field. He has been involved with Boccia, a Paralympic sport, and with Channel 31, where he has an on-camera role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He has also been involved with Beyond Disability. Beyond Disability is a local self-help group created to assist those with disabilities to have access to the appropriate technology. It was started by a magnificent local constituent, Richard Stubbs, who was a very successful banker. He developed a severe neuromuscular condition and lost much of his mobility. His response was not to feel sorry for himself but to establish a practical self-help group named Beyond Disability. I have watched as their charitable work has grown and expanded. It has provided a window to the world, an avenue and means of communication, self-respect, creativity and fulfilment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Out of that process has come Tom McGann. Tom has been determined to live the best life he can lead. He is really a shining example to me of a life well lived. So it is a real honour to have known him since he was such a young age and to have watched him develop through primary and secondary school and then enter tertiary education as a fine young Australian. His story is powerful because it is an example of what we can be and how we can overcome challenges and be our best selves. He has done that despite great difficulties, with the support of stunningly helpful and committed parents. In many cases, family circumstances just do not allow these steps forward. That is why we come to the issue of a national disability insurance scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw another example only a couple of weekends ago, when the Disabled Surfers Association of Australia held a disabled surf event at Point Leo on the Mornington Peninsula. My understanding is that there were over 50 participants. I was there in a wetsuit as one of the support crew—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HUNT:</span>
                    </a>  Yes! I gave my little bit. There were 50-plus participants who have disability, and they had the time of their lives. Some were a little bit frightened, but you could see their fear being overcome as something new came into their lives. You could see the joy—they were just thrilled to be in the water. By my count, there were over 200 volunteers there. It was one of the most uplifting events you could ever witness. It was Australians supporting Australians, locals supporting locals and families supporting families, in the best of all possible ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of these people and their families have endured extraordinary challenges and difficulties. Whether it is Tom McGann or the crew at the Disabled Surfers Association of Australia or the people for whom they are caring; whether it is Richard Stubbs or another local constituent, Alan Lachman, who, in order to give his daughter, Francesca, the best support he could, helped establish the Insight school for those with visual challenges, blindness and other forms of eyesight disability; whether it is those working in the autism space—and we have pledged to work with Senator Mitch Fifield, our shadow minister responsible, towards a national autism summit; whether it is any of those or the many other areas in which challenges abound, it is time for a National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle behind this is that, if you were designing a budget from scratch—if you had a blank sheet of paper—supporting those with disabilities in the best possible way would be right at the top of the list of measures because it is an expression of our humanity, an expression of decency and an expression of what we do. But, as we have developed in different ways over different times, we come to the point where we are today, with a different budgetary position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we have to do now, I think, is adopt two fundamental principles: firstly, flexibility of delivery and, secondly, a non-bureaucratic model. The critical principle of flexibility of delivery is that we find the right solution for the right person. Each person's needs will be different. That may mean that for some it is about respite, for others it is about ongoing care and for others it is about material assistance such as customisation of a car or other vehicle or provision of computer equipment. Our approach should be flexibility, and that is what I think is critical—a flexible approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads to the non-bureaucratic model. I am very heartened by what I have seen come out of Western Australia. I think the Barnett model of flexibility is non-bureaucratic and an extremely important way forward. I think we should all look to the way in which Western Australia has provided a model. At the end of the day, we want to achieve a simple, flexible, non-bureaucratic model which is not about employing lots and lots of public servants but about giving individual families, carers and those suffering from disabilities the ability to meet their most significant needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads me to my third and final point, which is about supported accommodation. The Hastings model, as it is sometimes called, of small supported accommodation started just across the road from my office. Families such as Norm and Dizzy Carlyon, Joy and David Jarman, and Karl and Marie Hell—Karl has now passed on—came together to say that we needed a small, local supported accommodation centre. That was funded and it is largely built, but I have to say, with great respect to the Commonwealth, that nothing has happened in the best part of 18 months. The buildings have been frozen and the Commonwealth has not intervened to ensure that a building issue is resolved. I would respectfully say to the minister: now is the time to intervene, bring together the different parties and make sure that this building dispute is ended. It is a great model and one which I would like to see as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but this case in Hastings can and should be resolved so we can get young people into supported accommodation. They are waiting; they are desperate; their families have visited. So I say to the minister: please intervene. This is an early example of the positive things that can be done by a national scheme. It is a pilot, an exemplar and a model. I ask for your help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, when I think of Tom McGann, disabled surf Australia, Richard Stubbs, the work that Alan Lachman has done and those parents of children with autism, for whom we did our walk two years ago, they need and, above all else deserve, our support. As a parliament, we can be our best selves by supporting them. I commend the notion of a joint parliamentary committee. We will, as a parliament—as a unified group of people—continue to work towards a model which ultimately is not about bureaucracy nor tight rules; it is about finding the right solution to the needs of each family with a significant disability so that those families and those with the disability can be their best selves.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I rise today to give my whole hearted support to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. It is an important bill. It shows that, as a country, we can be compassionate and fair, and we can look after those who are less fortunate—who, due to circumstances out of their control, have had things happen to them that mean that they will need assistance and help throughout their lives. As a society, we can recognise that and do what needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a young boy growing up, my parents every year took me along to support the Mansfield Autism Centre. They held a ball every year. It was put on to raise money for that centre, and as a young boy I came across the parents, the carers and the children who were in the centre, and I got an understanding of all the issues that they were dealing with. It has meant that as I have gone through life I have had a great deal of compassion and sympathy, but above all else I have had a great deal of admiration for everyone who works in the disability sector and for all those people with disabilities as they go about their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a parliament we have a real opportunity to make a difference with this bill, and that is what we should do. Only three or four months ago I was reminded of the time that I spent as a young boy trying to help and support the Mansfield Autism Centre, when I met with the Ararat Disability Parent Support Group. I went along to talk to the Ararat Disability Parent Support Group but also, more importantly, to listen. While I was there—I was there for a couple of hours—I heard some of the most compelling testimony that you would hear in your life as to why we need a national disability insurance scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One lady in particular read out a four-page letter about the difficulties that she had had getting respite for her child. It was an incredibly moving letter. I do not think anyone in the room—and there were 30 or 40 of us—had a dry eye by the time she has finished. The sad thing about her letter was that it showed clearly the difficulties that people face in this area. More often than not it is not because anyone sets out to deliberately cause problems or issues; it is just that the system is broken. It is having a huge personal toll on those who are dealing with this system. That is why we need to implement this bill. We need to implement the trials that are part of this bill and we need to get on with making sure that the National Disability Insurance Scheme becomes a reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take the time to thank the opposition shadow minister for disabilities, carers and the voluntary sector for the time that he has spent in my electorate explaining what the scheme would mean to our local communities. He has visited Portland, Warrnambool, Avoca and Maryborough. I am sure—he has said so—he would more than willing to come back and meet with other groups to explain how important this NDIS scheme is. I have met with more groups across the electorate, and everywhere I go all I can think is that the case is even more compelling for this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate those who have campaigned for the NDIS. I had a meeting on 8 September 2011 with Jacqui Pearce and Lynn Foreman, who came to my office to promote the NDIS. Lynn Foreman in particular went beyond the call of duty to ensure that she got to that meeting and was able, once again, to make me aware of the need for the NDIS. She tried to get down by train. In the end she could not, and ended up having to come in a taxi—which shows once again the difficulties people with disabilities face on a daily basis. But, once again, they were able to put an extremely compelling case—and that has been done across the nation, to all MPs and to all senators, to both state and federal parliamentarians, because we are going to require the cooperation of those two levels of government to ensure that the NDIS is rolled out and rolled out properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to mention Bill Shorten because, in his previous role as the parliamentary secretary for disabilities, he spent a lot of time publicising the need for the NDIS. In a show of bipartisanship I would like to recognise the contribution that Bill Shorten has made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to recognise the contribution that the Productivity Commission has made. It is not easy getting the parameters right around implementing such a thing as the NDIS. This is serious reform and it needs to be done in a way that we know will work. There are people whose hopes are dependant on the NDIS and its successful rollout, and the Productivity Commission to date has done an outstanding job in setting the framework as to how that should take place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about bipartisanship I think we should note—and this will be as important on our side, if we win the next election, as it is currently to the government—that we need to do everything we can as a parliament to make this a bipartisan step. This is something that all sides of this House should be able to get together and work on, to make sure that what we get is an excellent product. Neither side of this place has the wherewithal and the brains to ensure that every single element of this is rolled out to perfection. What we need to do is to make sure that we cooperate, that we work together, that we ensure that by putting our minds together collectively we do the best we can—and I think it is beholden to the government to look at what it can do to ensure that the NDIS is a bipartisan initiative, as much as it will be on this side if we win the next election. That is something that I will be extremely keen to see in the months and years ahead, as we continue to roll out the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are going to be important aspects of the scheme that we are going to have to make sure we get right. The previous speaker, Mr Hunt, expressed some of these aspects. There are two in particular that I would like to pick up on; one is that we are going to have to make sure that there is flexibility of delivery. There cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to this, because it will not work—across disabilities there are unique circumstances. When it comes to how this is rolled out, and the services delivered between metropolitan, regional and rural communities, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. So we have to ensure that there is proper flexibility in the system. If we do not do that, then once again we will see people battling the system, and they have been doing that for too long. That is what the NDIS is all about: trying to prevent the bureaucracy and the red tape from sucking the life out of people as they try to get help for their loved ones. We have to make sure that the system we put in place is flexible across disabilities, but it must also be flexible across communities, whether they are metropolitan, regional or rural.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have to ensure as best we can that red tape is minimised, because nothing strangles more than red tape. For people who are emotionally dealing with incredibly difficult circumstances, the last thing they need is having that emotion added to by having constant battles with red tape. Often the red tape is well-intentioned. It is put there to ensure that delivery occurs according to how the system is legislated, but we have to make sure that, in putting this system in place, what we want to see occur is very clear and we have to make sure it allows people to get on with caring for their loved ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time has come for this piece of legislation. It is something we need to see as quickly as possible. When I have met with groups across my electorate, there has been one uniform and compelling thing that they have said to me, and that is that they want to see compassion from their government—they call it 'their government', and they should call it 'their government'. They want to see an understanding, they want to see that people are listening and, above all else, they want to see a government which is prepared to step in and help them deal with the issues that they are dealing with on a daily basis. That is what this piece of legislation will enable. We still have a long way to go. We have to make sure that the trials are done properly; we have to make sure that we learn lessons from the trials; we have to make sure that the feedback from the trials will feed into the final NDIS; and we have to make sure that the establishment of the NDIS is done in such a way that we can continue to have bipartisan support for the model. These are going to be the challenges that we are all going to have to meet as we go forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say this: failure on this piece of legislation is not an option. Once you have met with community groups, once you have met with disability carers groups and once you have seen what these people are currently going through, you have to keep in the back of your mind that failure is not an option. They are doing wonderful work. They are dealing with things that we have to make sure we comprehend. We have to compassionately show that we understand and want to lend a hand. If we do not do that as a national parliament, we will fail. I do not want that resting upon my shoulders, as I am sure no-one else in this parliament wants it resting on theirs. I give my wholehearted support to this piece of legislation. We still have a lot of hard work to do, but we have to make sure that we do it and we get it right.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CROOK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. I agree with many statements made by members of this House, on both sides of politics, and I would particularly like to endorse the comments of the member for Wannon. I have enjoyed the non-politicised, passionate words from members such as the member for Gippsland and my friend the member for Denison. As members are all too aware, the current disability support system is unfair, underfunded and disjointed. The current system fails to give people with a disability proper choice about their future and gives no guarantee of access to appropriate support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a fortunate, wealthy country where most Australians enjoy freedom of choice and boundless opportunities. However, one of the largest minority groups, people living with a disability, are not afforded basic rights and are not protected by the social safety net that protects most Australians. In many cases Australia has failed to provide people living with a disability with the very basic commitments of fairness and human rights. It is sad to hear that by most empirical measurements Australians living with disabilities and their carers are among the most disadvantaged groups in Australia. All Australians deserve a fair go. In this respect, these changes are long overdue. I believe we will look back at this time as an important crossroad in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many times in this 43rd Parliament when I have been embarrassed about the politicking, infighting and obsession with party room antics that occur at the expense of our constituents, but today I am proud. I am proud to be a member of this parliament when both sides of politics are working together to improve the lives of Australians and to give people with a disability a right to realise their potential—a right that should be afforded to all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In such an important debate, I feel it is important to stop and make some acknowledgements. As members have done before me, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the carers of people with disabilities—to all the O'Connor electorate carers who I have had the pleasure of meeting and all those who I am yet to meet and, indeed, all carers in Australia. I acknowledge the enduring love and lifelong commitment that carers give to their disabled family members and friends. I acknowledge the huge amount of work that carers undertake and their willingness to participate in vital, unpaid work that benefits the entire community. I acknowledge the integral role that carers play in the Australian health system and in the Australian economy. I acknowledge and congratulate many of those carers who have done so much work to put this debate on the national agenda for those who cannot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge the professional staff who work in the O'Connor electorate and I acknowledge the professional staff who work in high-care facilities, nursing homes and schools throughout Australia. Thank you for your tireless work. It not only improves the lives of many individuals and their families but contributes to the social fabric of our regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I acknowledge all of those people living with a disability in the O'Connor electorate. I acknowledge all those who joined me for a morning tea in Kalgoorlie and to all those who joined Wendy Duncan, at the time the member of the Legislative Council in Western Australia, for a DisabiliTEA in Esperance. In particular, I acknowledge the special people from my electorate who have taken the time to share their stories with me and to contribute to this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout 2012 I heard from many constituents on this issue—some with disabilities, some carers, some support service professionals, and many community members who thought that people with a disability deserved a fairer go. As members have done before me, I would like to share a couple of stories. It is most important to remember that these stories reflect what it is like every single day for many Australians. One such story that sticks in my mind is from Kathy and Greg Jones in Narrogin in regional Western Australia. Kathy and Greg are 60-year-old parents of a son with cerebral palsy. Their son is in a wheelchair and is fully reliant on his parents for everything. He is unable to walk or talk. Kathy and Greg, like many committed parents with a disabled child, often wonder, 'What happens when we are unable to care for our child? Once we pass away, where will our child live? How will he be looked after?' Without the NDIS, the answer to these questions and to many more is too difficult to contemplate by any parent. Kathy and Greg have commented that, once they know that the NDIS is on the way, they may begin to sleep at night again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is Jill, a tireless worker in disability support services in the city of Albany on the south-west coast of my electorate. Jill has described the astonishing amount of stress that families are put under when they are unable to access proper support for their disabled child. Under the current system, families have to bare their souls and participate in a very crisis-driven application process for support. Jill knows of families that simply cannot cope with the stress of not having support for their child. Some families have ended up with mental illnesses and within the mental health system from the stress. This, in fact, compounds the problem because, as we all know, mental health has its issues around funding and service delivery, particularly in regional and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other families have considered handing their child back to the Department of Child Protection. This a notion that, to most, is incomprehensible and a decision that must be devastating. These levels of stress are echoed by participants in the Productivity Commission inquiry who noted that parents regularly contemplate suicide as they have been unable to find adequate support for their child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My next story is of a very special Goldfields woman who gave me information about the NDIS in 2010 at my campaign launch in Kalgoorlie prior to being an elected member of this House. I have known Jo Russell for many, many years. For Jo the NDIS has been a very long time coming. Jo is the mother of three children and her eldest and youngest, Daniel and Megan, both have autism. Jo has dealt with disability service providers for over 20 years and I trust her when she says that the problem with disability care is that the system was not created and modelled by those who actually use it. I cannot summarise some of the information Jo has provided to me, so will read Jo's comments. She stated:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Too often, we have to repeat our stories over and over, only to be told we are not 'eligible' or that funding is insufficient for our needs. We have to create and recreate our stories of stress, misery, financial insufficiency and difficulties. Absolutely humiliating and hardly uplifting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are sick to the back teeth of service providers and organisations 'assessing' us, and determining what they feel is best for us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Truthfully, it makes me want to vomit—so tired of the emphasis of service providers on doing things for and 'to' people, rather than 'with' people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Disability assistance is seen more as a charity model—the terms used in disability language is revolting—we are known as 'clients'—actually we are PEOPLE, thank you!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jo continued:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">THEIR words include things like victim, support, care, crisis, assimilation, programmes, behaviours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the language of disability should include words like empowerment, rights and participation, choice, control, and self-determination, dignity, and assurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is critical that we have a system that supports people to make their own decisions, chart their own course, call the shots, but needs to be accompanied by appropriate checks and balances on outcomes. And that system is the NDIS.</span>

Jo is a strong advocate for not only her own children but also every other family or individual touched by disability in the Goldfields region. Keep up the amazing work you do, Jo. I am totally bewildered by how you do it all on two hours sleep a day.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note I have a niece with Down syndrome and have seen firsthand the unexpected difficulties that can arise for families including my own. Tess is a twin and she and Emma are now both 11 years old. My wife and I babysit Tess from time to time, and getting her out of the pool is like pulling teeth. Tess does not let me watch the footy when the Dockers are playing because her mum and dad have brainwashed her into only watching the Eagles. That is something that really bemuses me. Tess attends a wonderful school in Kalgoorlie which can cater for her needs and that of her classmates. Again I touch on the amazing work that carers and teachers offer our young students with disabilities. Tess is a great kid, with so much energy, enthusiasm and love to give. However, I know the NDIS will give her just that much more support for her to continue to grow as the gorgeous young lady she already is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These stories fill me with mixed emotions. The first is to do with the love that families have within them. The second is disappointment that the current system has failed so many Australians. However, the strongest emotion must be the one of hope in all of us for the change that the NDIS promises to so many families and hope that this place can work to support people with disabilities. As politicians, as leaders, as community members, as members of families, we have a responsibility to work together to ensure the implementation of this program without letting politics get in the way. This cannot and must not be politicised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The unavoidable truth is that this program needs both sides of politics to work together. Although the key players from government and the opposition should be congratulated on bringing this issue to the floor, the success of the NDIS will require ongoing collaboration, non-partisan commitment and funding security. The NDIS will require funding from this government and from future governments, even in a tight fiscal environment. The NDIS will require commitment to its implementation from this government and from future governments. For this reason alone, the amendment moved by the opposition leader should be absolutely endorsed. The most important issue in this debate in my view is that we must not raise the hopes of these very special people in our community only to fail them at the very last hurdle. In this respect, I support the bill and encourage all members to truly put aside party politics on this issue. We must keep politics out of the debate. We need to do what is owed to these families affected by disability. For these reasons, I support the bill. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. We on this side of the House stand ready to work with the government to ensure that a successful and working NDIS is delivered as soon as possible for all those in need. It is an increasingly rare event for parliaments across the country to consider a piece of legislation so universally supported. That is because the NDIS is all about a fair go for those Australians who need help and support structures to ensure that they can more fully participate in our community. It was Winston Churchill who once said that you measure the degree of civilisation of a society by how it treats it weakest members. It is a statement that I believe most members in this place would agree with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing adequate care for people with a disability is absolutely core government business. I make this point at a time when government is larger, more intrusive and more bloated than ever before. I am reminded by the whole debate leading up to this bill why we are actually here: we are here to protect and improve the lives of all Australians, including disabled Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year alone, there more than 250 pieces of legislation passed through this parliament. In many cases, those bills had the effect of increasing regulations and limiting freedom. The pursuit of freedom is something that many opposite place a lower degree of importance on than we on this side of the House. But that pursuit of freedom, both in a personal and community sense, is ingrained in the DNA of the opposition. The bill before us today is unusual in that it will increase the size of government, and most certainly increase expenditure but, at its core, will have the effect of dramatically increasing the freedom of so many people in this country who suffer from a disability—and, in fact, it will dramatically increase the freedom of their carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is no small thing. In 2009, 3.5 million Australians were reported as having a specific limitations or restriction. About 1.3 million people had a profound or severe core activity limitation. There is a huge section of our society whose daily freedoms are restricted through no fault of their own. If there is anything that we as national legislators can do to improve the daily lives and increase the freedoms of a large portion of our society then we should do whatever we can in order to achieve this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly go over some statistics that help paint a picture of disability in Australia. These figures were presented in a PricewaterhouseCoopers report a little over a year ago. The report notes that people with a disability in this country are some 50 per cent less likely to be employed than those without a disability. Beyond that simple fact, a lack of employment obviously leads to financial stress and has an impact on a person's freedom, their confidence, their living standard and their ability to pursue other life objectives. For someone who has recently acquired a disability, the loss of employment often has a more dramatic result. In that instance we often see a rapid downward spiral. It is imperative that we do everything that we in this place can to enhance the opportunities of people with a disability to seek, gain and retain employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next statistic is shocking, particularly when you compare the figure with those from other comparable and, relatively speaking, wealthy nations. When you know that 45 per cent of Australians with a disability live in poverty you realise how grim things are. This is more than 2.5 times the rate of poverty experienced in the general population and more than twice the OECD average, which is 22 per cent. On this issue, we rank a lowly 21st out of 29 OECD countries. When we look at other OECD figures, we see that the OECD average for relative poverty risk is approximately 1.6, which means that those with a disability have a poverty risk 1.6 times higher than those without a disability. Australia has a relative poverty risk of 2.7, making us by far the worst performer in the OECD. These figures are grim and should give all of us reason to pause and think.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be naive to suggest that the NDIS will be the answer to all our problems. It will not be. It is important that we do not present this program as some type of magical cure or panacea. Indeed, one of the authors of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that I referred to earlier said that the NDIS could help drive greater workforce and community participation for those with disabilities but only if it was accompanied by a broader cultural shift. He went on to say: 'Without other things happening, an NDIS won't deliver its full potential. If kids with disability can't get into education or access transport to get to a job, we'll continue to fall further behind, even with an NDIS.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PricewaterhouseCoopers report suggested that the implementation of an NDIS could support an additional 370,000 people with disabilities into the workforce by 2050. An additional 80,000 carers could also enter the workforce as they were freed from their daily caring responsibilities. This would be terrific. But let us not forget that if there are around 4.5 million Australians who suffer from a form of disability and if a large proportion of those people are already living below the poverty line then we cannot expect an NDIS to make all problems in this space go away—and certainly not overnight—through some miraculous stroke of the pen. This is a very important scheme, but it would be foolish of us to raise expectations where the point that the inevitable reaction of the Australian community is one of disappointment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said all of that, the coalition obviously approaches this bill in the most constructive spirit possible. We supported the initial work by the Productivity Commission, we supported the $1 billion in the budget last year and we supported the five launch sites. We support this legislation because we want the NDIS to be a success. Also, we will support measures in the months ahead to ensure that we get a robust and workable NDIS that services our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of the parents in my electorate who took the time over the last few years to come and see me and relate their very personal stories, very painfully and very emotionally at times, to me. I know that many of their fellow carers have done the same with my colleagues on this side of the House and with members of the government. They need to be given particular credit. They take time out from their very important commitments to care for family members. Without their persistence and perseverance—they give the issue of disability care and disability services a very real and human aspect—I suspect we may not have reached this point at this particular time. I want to thank them and acknowledge their contribution in standing up and demanding of government what they need, what their families need and what any civilised society ought to provide in order to give those in our community with disabilities, and their carers, the freedom to more fully participate in our society.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TURNBULL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I begin where my friend and colleague the member for Indi finished, speaking about the sacrifices that so many parents and families make supporting loved ones, especially children, with disabilities. It is long overdue that we are debating a national disability insurance scheme and that we are on the verge of seeing a national disability insurance scheme actually realised in Australia. It is a testament to the significance of this reform that we have seen so many members from both sides of this chamber add their voices to this debate. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, this truly is an idea whose time has come, and the coalition are strongly committed to an NDIS and have been since we supported the government's referral to the Productivity Commission of an inquiry into a national disability insurance scheme, in 2009. That report was released in 2011 and it confirmed that our current system of support for people with a disability was utterly inadequate, a finding that, while disheartening, we recognised and acknowledged called for action from governments at both the federal and the state level. Australia's funding and support system for those most in need is clearly broken, and this National Disability Insurance Scheme has been a long time coming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to say that along with all the other members of the coalition—and I note in particular the advocacy work of Senator Mitch Fifield—I support this proposal to support people with disabilities and their families. It should be a thoroughly core government business. A federally funded scheme that will provide people with a disability, and their carers and families, with regular care and support and with the therapy and equipment they need to live a dignified and fulfilled life is a challenge that faces us all, but it is one that we must all confront to ensure that parliament turns this dream—apparently a bipartisan dream—into a fully functioning and fully funded policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important that the government, through this debate, stop trying to represent the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the NDIS, as being a Labor reform. It is not a Labor reform; it is a reform that has the wholehearted support of all sides of politics and it is one that will be more compelling and more likely to come to realisation if it is seen as being one of those causes, those political or social reforms, that is not the property of one side of politics or another. There are some issues and causes in this House that are very much the property of one side of politics—some that the government holds dear to but we would disown, and vice versa. But this is one that we should all stand united upon because it is a huge challenge. It is huge in the scale of its complexity, dealing with so many people, each with individual needs and each with thoroughly unique needs. The scale of the resources needed is formidable. An increase in funding from $6 billion to $12 billion towards disability services is not a trifling amount of money. I might say that it underlines the need for prudent economic management, for prudent use of government resources and to ensure that we have a strong and growing economy that will generate the government revenues that will be needed to meet the requirements of this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept, as the Productivity Commission has recommended, would see all Australians contributing to and, should they need it, having access to a well-funded individualised scheme for their own care where individuals needing support would receive vouchers they would be able to spend on service providers, who, over time, would start to provide competitively the service that individuals need. This system will be one where support is based on need, where the individual has more control over the support services, aid and equipment they need in order to live their life to the full and to be able to rise above their disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I noted earlier, the coalition supported the initial reference to the Productivity Commission, we supported the $1 billion allocated in the last federal budget, and we have supported the five launch sites as well as the agreement between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales government to extend the trial to a full state-wide rollout following the Hunter region launch. It has been encouraging, too, to see this concept of a national disability insurance scheme endorsed at COAG.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of my own constituents in the electorate of Wentworth have raised this matter with me directly. Whether it is principal Ian Gallan from the Wairoa School in Bondi, or Dr Chris Blackwell, one of our local clinicians, or the many other parents with stories as heartrending as they are profound, they have supported this important initiative. I am a proud patron of SailorswithdisABILITIES, which is a not-for-profit organisation in my electorate of Wentworth that is committed to changing not only the way those with disabilities view themselves but also society's perception of those with a disability. SailorswithdisABILITIES helps over 4,000 disabled children and adults annually through their sailing programs and has an extensive network of volunteers from the local community offering their support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a thoroughly able-bodied seaman I know just how difficult sailing can be, certainly in some conditions. It is wonderful to see SailorswithdisABILITIES not only build the confidence of those living with a disability by demonstrating just what they can achieve, but also developing the skills and showing the benefits of working in a team. The founder of SailorswithdisABILITIES, David Pescud, said that he could never accept being written-off because of his disability. He said, 'I was always more interested in what you can do rather than what you cannot do.' That goes to the heart of what an NDIS should be all about. It is about enabling those with a disability to fully participate in all aspects of life. It is about giving those living with a disability the opportunity to maximise their potential, to give them the dignity, the lifestyle and the independence they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the SailorswithdisABILITIES crew completed the Sydney to Hobart race, crossing the finishing line after three days, 20 hours, four minutes and two seconds at sea. Their crew of disabled sailors beat 50 other boats in the international blue water race, led by the organisation's founder, David Pescud, and president, David Leslie, both of whom are sailors with disabilities. Brett Pearce, a member and volunteer, said of the organisation, 'Being part of SailorswithdisABILITIES is about being part of an organisation that empowers disabled people to achieve more than they thought capable.' Of a National Disability Insurance Scheme David Pescud said the benefits for the members to have the decision-making power to decide who, how and where they choose to spend their funds for their services that they require 'empowers people to make decisions for themselves and the opportunity of the governance of their own lives'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another institution in my electorate, which provides education and other services to students with intellectual and physical disabilities from four to 18, is the Wairoa Special School at Bondi. Every year, at our annual Christmas party, we raise money for that school—and it receives support from many other generous people in the community. As Wairoa school and its supporters, families and teachers will be all too aware, it is absolutely vital that those living with a disability get the proper care and education early, before those difficulties multiply—and this is the fantastic service that Wairoa offers, by providing the physical environment which specifically addresses the varying needs of their many students and fosters a culture of support both at school and at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Wairoa, one of the biggest issues is ensuring children are properly assessed. Those who are better-off financially often have more opportunity to have their child assessed properly; and then, if they are assessed as acute, they can receive the maximum level of care. At Wairoa, 50 per cent of the children cared for have autism—and yet their needs differ greatly. Wairoa's experience is that determining the level of care that is required for a child with mild autism or acute autism is like comparing chalk and cheese, as often the children are not assessed properly, because their symptoms are all so different—and, as I said earlier, early assessment is absolutely critical. What Wairoa hopes for in an NDIS is to have a more structured assessment process and a more structured level of assistance to parents so there will be surety and equity of care. One of the main concerns for Dominic Sweeney, a teacher at Wairoa, is the level of care the children receive once they leave the school—the support they get there is fantastic, yet there is a failure at every level, he says, to provide adequate care for them once they move on. An NDIS should be able to address this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Windgap, another organisation, just outside of my electorate in Eastlakes, knows just how important education and support for those with disabilities are to ensure they reach their full potential and raise community awareness to their needs and aspirations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another institution in my community that would have a remarkable difference made to it by an NDIS is Jewish Care, which runs a disability support program for 140 members of the Jewish community with an intellectual disability and provides support for 180 more with a mental illness. The clients of Jewish Care rely almost entirely on the community-raised income for their support. Claire Vernon, of Jewish Care, tells me of a 61-year-old woman living in Department of Housing and Community Services accommodation and attending Print-35, a fantastic initiative established by Jewish Care, which I visited, which employs people with disabilities to produce quality printing while contributing to their personal development and sense of worth. However, to enable this lady to manage in the community, Jewish Care provides a case manager and 16 hours of drop-in support every week—of which eight hours are contributed by the New South Wales government. She is like many with a disability: as they age their needs become more complex. Providing individuals with the funding to enable them to continue to live independently in the community, to direct support to the services they need the most, would, in Jewish Care's opinion, be a wonderful initiative. The need for flexibility and a person-centred approach is something that Jewish Care has recognised and acted on through its flexible funding program which provides $3,000 to $5,000 to families to purchase therapy and respite support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Jewish Care knows all too well, for too long families have had to negotiate the maze of services and the lottery of gaining a spot in a program or service. The great virtue of a NDIS is that funding is linked to the needs of each individual and the maximum autonomy and independence is accorded to that individual as their care plans and services are identified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are clearly great prospects and great needs for a NDIS, many concerns remain. So much of how the scheme operates will depend on the rules that are still being finalised and on establishing the long-term funding arrangements to guarantee lifetime support. Above all—and I emphasise this not in any sense of partisanship—the prudent economic management of the government of the Commonwealth is absolutely critical. All of our compassion, all of our concern, for people with disabilities, all of our aspirations for an NDIS, will be only so much warm thoughts and warm words if we cannot afford to pay for them. It has often been said that a vision without resources is nothing more than a hallucination. We cannot afford to fool ourselves about a reform of this scale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be one of the great social reforms of our time—indeed, of any time. It has the coalition's utmost support. We are committed to it and we are, above all, committed to ensuring that if we are returned to government later this year the economy, the business of government, of this nation will be managed in a way that we can well afford to show in real terms—in financial terms—the backing that our compassion calls us to provide.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IAN MACFARLANE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  I congratulate the member for Wentworth on his very well-chosen words in relation to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. We have heard many eloquent and heartfelt speeches from both sides of the House attesting to the wide support for a national disability insurance scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is clearly wide acknowledgement in the community and in this parliament that we need a scheme such as the NDIS. That support is visible wherever you go. Everyone in this chamber will have spoken with people in their own electorates, as I have, who can attest to the fact that the current support system for people with a disability does not work. There are people in our local communities who are carers or who need support, but there can be no one rule that applies to everyone and that works with the same level of effectiveness—disabilities are so varied; families are so varied; the pressures on families are so varied; and the ability of families to deal with a child or children with a disability are varied. A lot of it equates to time; a lot of it equates to money; and some of it even equates to the ability to actually deal with the issue itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The level of support a person with a disability receives can therefore depend on a number of factors, both within the family and outside it. Some of those factors include where they live. Are they are on a rural property 60, 70 or 100 kilometres from the nearest town? Are they in a small town, perhaps in western Queensland or eastern Western Australia or some other isolated place where the level of support simply is not available? Is the disability congenital or was it acquired and, if so, when was it acquired? What was the person's position in terms of economic security when it was acquired? There is a whole range of factors. Of course, if the disability is the result of an accident there may be support mechanisms through workers compensation and motor vehicle insurance in some states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, again, the issue is not just the disability but how the disability occurred and whether or not the disability occurred as a result of an accident. Particularly if you acquire a disability later in life, the handling of the whole issue is much more difficult—you have to contend with the extra issues of queues and waiting lists. This results in many people with a disability being left without the assistance that they need. There is no doubt we need a new system of support based on need, rather than rationing of an entitlement for support spread across the disabled community. We need to ensure that we deal with this area better. The individual needs to be at the centre of the support. The individual needs to be in charge—to be able to pick the support, aids, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission's landmark report into the long-term care and support for people with disabilities. This is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up with a disabled brother. He has achieved far more in this world, because of the assistance and support he was able to get, than anyone probably thought possible when they looked at that five-year-old with cerebral palsy and wondered if he would ever be able to speak in a way which people could understand, to walk, and to be a productive member of the community. So when I talk about disability insurance and the need to support people with disabilities I think of my brother Neil. He has achieved an extraordinary amount in his life, for many reasons. The first is that he is one of the most determined and stubborn people I have ever met. When he was old enough to understand, he made up his mind that he would overcome his disabilities as best he could. He was able to do so because he was given the support he needed. Obviously, a great deal of that support came from the family. We are a determined family in our own way—I know people would be shocked to hear that!—and when we set our minds on achieving something we usually achieve it. The family has certainly been a great support to him, but, in the end, what really made the difference was the support and services that he got.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He was, of course, supported in another age—the age of institutions. They are out of favour these days—I think sometimes they are unfairly. The Spastic Centre has, in the past, achieved some phenomenal results, but sending children away to a centre like that is now not seen as socially acceptable, and that makes me wonder just how many people like Neil are currently missing out on the opportunities that he was given. The Spastic Centre at New Farm in Brisbane, with the support of our family and the determination of Neil, were able to produce an individual, an adult, who I taught to drive. He ended up getting married and having a child. He worked for most of his life as a public servant. Before that he was even more productive as a farmer. He is now retired. He has achieved a great deal. But, in all honesty, I have to say that Neil is the exception rather than the rule in terms of people with severe disabilities. When we look at people like my brother and what they have achieved, we also have to realise that we are a family who had the wherewithal to do what was needed, and that was in his favour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we need to look at what can be implemented in an NDIS is that, in the end, we need to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to achieve their maximum possible outcome in regard to their disability and their potential. So we need a scheme that, as I say, is individual in the way it operates—that is, not a one-size-fits-all scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As the Leader of the Opposition said at the National Press Club recently:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we've offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn't flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Really, this is about being totally bipartisan. If this issue becomes political—if this becomes an issue which people try to gain votes or political points on—it will simply bogged down. The reality is that the government should accept our offer of a parliamentary oversight committee. The coalition intend to give the government, the Greens and the Independents an opportunity to accept our hand of cooperation by moving an amendment to this bill to establish a nonpartisan oversight committee. That offer should be accepted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so important to note that every government in Australia and every opposition in Australia supports the NDIS, so the issue is not whether we should have an NDIS but whether we should make it happen now rather than haggle over the political issues and not see it happen anytime soon. People in our communities and community organisations are of that view as well. When I talk to the people in Toowoomba who run the Endeavour foundation or to the many other groups that deal with the enormous challenges faced in providing opportunity, care, therapy and treatment for people with disabilities, they are not interested in things that need to be argued about, detailed and sorted out; they just want to see it happen. Parents come to see me and talk about their children, some of whom are, literally, 55 or 60 years old. These parents wonder how their children will be looked after when they, the parents, are no longer around. They are not interested in the politics that often surrounds this place; they just want to see it happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I refer to my own experience and say that we were lucky in that we were able to do something, but parents with disabled children carry an enormous burden for the whole life of that disabled child. Things are different in a family with a disabled child. No matter how you adjust—and we adjusted pretty well—there are things that need to be done for that child which put pressure and strain on every member of that family, be they child or parent. We need to address this issue and soon. Parents are carrying an enormous weight out there. As I say, our family was fortunate. We banded together. Neil was determined and he has led a relatively normal life. I see families whose every waking moment, almost 24 hours a day, is spent caring for a disabled child. That is why it is imperative that we resolve this issue. That is why it is imperative that we get ourselves into a position where this scheme is affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Wentworth mentioned, and I support him 100 per cent, that the real issue here is that we move forward with our support for an NDIS and work out the implementation passage, but also that we have a government that can govern and provide the money to support the scheme. In the end, with all the intentions, good wishes and cooperation in the world, this will boil down to money and a serious amount of it. We need a government that can manage its budget, and that is part of the issue we are facing: no matter how well-intentioned we are in this House and no matter how much we agree, we are going to have to pay for this. And the problem we have at the moment is that this government is broke—absolutely stone motherless broke. It is broke to the point that it has borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars. So part of the challenge in making sure that this scheme comes about is getting a government that can run a budget in surplus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at the period ahead, let's hope that we do get that government, but in the meantime we all need to focus on ensuring that we continue to take this path to implement an NDIS. It will require cooperation, and the coalition has offered that. It will require bipartisanship, and the coalition has offered that. It will require that we all sit down around a table and, as we say, co-chair a committee to make this happen. The challenge for the government is to accept that and join with us in making this happen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="TK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SOUTHCOTT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. This is a momentous overhaul of disability funding across Australia and represents a once-in-a-generation reform. The bill establishes the framework for the NDIS and the framework for the NDIS Launch Transition Agency. On average, every 30 minutes someone in Australia is diagnosed with a significant disability. There are 410,000 people across Australia who have a permanent disability that significantly affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current system of support for Australians living with a disability is not working. The level of support a person with a disability receives in Australia depends on a number of factors: what state they live in, what disability they have and how that disability was attained. While workplace and motor vehicle accidents are covered by accident insurance, those who are born with a disability or who acquire one later in life can be left without the assistance they need or be faced with waiting lists and queues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission found that, while there are pockets of successfully managed disability services in some states, no disability support services are working well across the board. I have seen, in my 17 years as a federal member, that families are often frustrated by the lack of support that they receive from state government disability services and by the fact that this support is rationed. We need a new system of support for those with disabilities that is based on need, rather than the current system of rationing on a budget allocation. The individual needs to be in control. The individual needs to be at the centre and able to pick the support, aid, equipment and service providers of their choice. This is the vision of the Productivity Commission report and it is the vision of the NDIS. It will work in a similar way to Medicare, a successful social insurance scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has been an enthusiastic supporter of the NDIS at every step. We supported the Productivity Commission work, we supported the $1 billion in the last budget, we supported the five launch sites and we are supporting this legislation. We believe the NDIS can be delivered in the time frame recommended by the Productivity Commission. As evidence of our goodwill, we are willing to work with the government to see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible. This historic reform will develop over the life of several parliaments and needs to be the property of the parliament rather than of any one political party. That is why the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee, to be chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. This would provide a non-partisan environment where issues of design and eligibility could be worked through cooperatively. Unfortunately, those opposite have refused this by voting down Senator Fifield's motion in the Senate with the support of the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill establishes the framework for the NDIS and the NDIS Launch Transition Agency. The agency will be set up as an independent body separate from government to deliver and manage the NDIS. This will allow the scheme to be launched in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first site is designed to benefit over 20,000 people with disabilities, their families and carers. The five launch sites are South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, Hunter in the New South Wales and Barwon in Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An NDIS looks beyond just the immediate need of a person with disabilities and focuses on what that person will require across their lifetime. The scheme provides funding to help people with a disability to participate more fully in economic and social life by providing an entitlement that will allow them to organise aids, equipment, supported accommodation or personal attendant care. The NDIS, when fully implemented, will be available to all Australians who have a permanent disability that significantly affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Boothby there are many important sites where there are a number of people with a disability who will benefit from an NDIS. Bedford Industries, based at Panorama in Boothby since 1949 and originally founded in 1920, is an employment and training provider for people with a disability. It has an excellent reputation across the nation. Bedford supports almost 4,000 people with a disability or disadvantage. It employs 800 people with disabilities across South Australia in its furniture, horticulture, hospitality, packaging and other areas. Bedford provides living arrangements for almost 200 people up at its Balyana residences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minda, established in 1898, is South Australia's largest disability service provider. It offers support and opportunity to over 1,500 people in accommodation, supported employment, lifestyle services and respite. Minda has already received $30,000 in funding to prepare themselves for the NDIS through the NDIS Readiness Fund. The Suneden School, founded in 1943 and located in Mitchell Park, is a private school catering for children with intellectual and multiple disabilities aged between five and 21 years old. My electorate office has a number of artworks from the students of Suneden School, and their art show every year is always a highlight of the local community's calendar.    Suneden has close links with a number of external agencies to assist with their provision of programs, including Disability SA, Autism SA, Novita, Minda, Respite Services and various workplace providers, including Bedford Industries, Orana and Phoenix.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this is an important change that will help support those around Australia with disabilities. The coalition supports this bill, and we stand ready with the government to make the NDIS a reality.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="848" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SECKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  At short notice I come into this chamber to talk about a very important subject: the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. The following might be of interest to the member of Boothby, because in closing his remarks he talked about the Suneden School in Mitchell Park. I can inform him that my sister, who was mentally retarded, went to Suneden. She was there for quite a while. It was certainly a very important part of her life to visit Suneden. I know they use different terms these days than the one I use, but I grew up with my sister, who was about 20 months older than myself. She was the seventh-born in the family, and I was the eighth. My mother likes to dine out on the story that when I came along at least one person thought I was perfect; the doctor wanted to reassure my mother that I did not have any intellectual disabilities—although I am sure some people might disagree with that now!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is a very important subject, and there is no doubt in my mind that it is a very worthy one. I may speak later about some of the problems that may exist. There are some people who may not be covered who think that they will be covered. In fact, I had an email and a phone call only last week from constituents who were concerned, in one case, that once they reached 65 there would not be any coverage—and they were actually thinking about their son—and, in another case, whether blindness was actually covered by this. And I suppose that is the concern of some people: they might think they are being covered when in actual fact they will not be covered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept of a national disability insurance scheme has gained momentum over the past few years. Whenever it has been brought up in this parliament I have been a very strong supporter. One of the reasons it has gained momentum is due to a very strong grassroots campaign by carers, Australians with disabilities and the organisations that support them. More recently, the Every Australian Counts campaign, chaired by John Della Bosca, has certainly made sure we have strong support in this chamber. It has certainly kept the National Disability Insurance Scheme in the public mind on behalf of all those disability organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS concept was conceived by John Walsh AM and progressed by Bruce Bonyhady AM, President of Philanthropy Australia. It was first canvassed at the 2020 Summit in 2008. It is probably the only decent thing that came out of that 2020 Summit in 2008. In 2009—so we are talking about four years ago—the federal coalition supported the government's referral to the Productivity Commission for an inquiry into a national disability insurance scheme. A final report of the Productivity Commission inquiry was released on 10 August 2011. Anyone who has looked at that final report would be encouraged by the support given by the Productivity Commission and would confirm that the current system of support for people with disability is—in their language—'broken'. This conclusion was endorsed by the federal coalition in all of its jurisdictions. We are not playing politics with this. We totally support it and any suggestion otherwise is bunkum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Agreement has been reached with five states and territories, including my own home state of South Australia, the ACT, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Launch sites will commence in the states in July this year and in the ACT in July next year. In December 2012 the New South Wales state government and the Commonwealth government concluded an intergovernmental agreement for a full state-wide rollout of the NDIS beyond the Hunter launch site. Further expansion of the NDIS will be dependent on the Commonwealth negotiating and concluding further bilateral agreements with each jurisdiction. Queensland and Western Australia are not hosting launch sites but both have submitted proposals to the Commonwealth to be part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and they are certainly part of the support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government has sought to claim the NDIS as its own, rejecting bipartisanship on a number of occasions. That is pretty sad. This is too important to play politics with. This has the support of the whole parliament and it is not just them or us; we all support it. Our only concern is where the money is coming from. We are committed to finding that money. We certainly want to show that it does have very strong cross-party support at both federal and state levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides for the establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Some people might ask: why has this taken so long? To be fair to the government and to everyone, this is a big decision by government and a big decision by this parliament. It will need a pilot scheme. The last thing we want is money just thrown at something without some sort of sensible pilot scheme to make sure that it works. It is important that we do this properly. That probably means we are going a bit slower than some people would like, but if we do it properly we will end up with a well-thought-out scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agency may provide general support for people with disability who are not participants in the NDIS, through information, coordination and referral activities. While most funding for NDIS participants will be in the form of individual support packages, the agency may block fund some entities that support people with disability. That is a bit like what we do with block funding in private schools: as a government, we do not get down to the nitty-gritty and saying, 'You do it this way.' For example, in my electorate, where the Lutheran school system is very strong, they get block funding and organise it themselves. In some ways I think that is more efficient than government bureaucracies trying to run it. We support that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The eligibility provisions described in the scheme require that a person's impairment results in substantially reduced functional capacity affecting their communication, social interaction, learning, mobility, self-care or self-management. Eligibility includes early intervention to mitigate, alleviate or prevent the deterioration of a person's functional capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, people over 65 years of age at the time they request NDIS support will not be eligible. However, future participants can choose to continue with the NDIS once they turn 65. The assessment method will be in the NDIS rules. It is important that we have personal planning provisions which emphasise a person-centred and self-directed approach. A plan must include a statement of participant goals and aspirations prepared by the participant in the statement of participant supports to be approved by the agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I digress for a short period of time. Very early in my career as a member of this parliament, I was approached by four mothers in my electorate. I remember the meeting very well. They were concerned not so much about themselves and the work that they do as carers—they saw that as their duty and that was not a problem—but about what happens when they die. You hear that time and time again: 'Who is going to look after my children?' Obviously they will have grown up a bit more, but who will look after them when both parents are deceased? That was a real concern for them because they want to ensure that their offspring get the proper care that they need. I have heard that very often when other members speak on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to the bill itself, the plans will specify general support—and that is not purchased with individualised funding—and reasonable and necessary support. Of course, when we talk about 'reasonable', that is always a bit of a moot point: what is reasonable? Some people will want more than others think is reasonable, but in the end we will do our best, whether we are in government or in opposition, to make sure that they get that support. There will also be a review date and it will describe how the funds and other aspects of the plan will be managed. Managing the funding for supports under a plan can be done by a registered plan management provider, a nominee, the agency or participants themselves. Plan management involves purchasing supports, and receiving, managing and acquitting the funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Details about the process to become a registered provider of supports or a plan manager will be outlined in the NDIS rules. The agency may compel prospective participants to take action to obtain compensation for personal injury, and the agency is entitled to recover relevant portions of any compensation awarded to participants. These provisions are designed to protect the NDIS from cost-shifting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will have to be review processes. Information on review rights must be given to participants when reviewable decisions are made. Reviewable decisions cover eligibility support plans, provider registration, and nominee determinations. And, like many parts of legislation from this parliament, the legislation provides a further avenue of review to the all-important Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governance will also be important. The agency will have a board consisting of a chair and eight members who collectively will possess an appropriate balance of skills, experience or knowledge in the following fields: provisional use of disability services, operation of insurance, compensation or long-term liability schemes, financial management or corporate governance. The Commonwealth minister will appoint the chair and must obtain the approval of a majority of jurisdictions before those members are appointed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also establishes an independent advisory council that will include at least four people with disabilities; at least two carers; at least one person with skills, experience or knowledge in the supply of equipment or provision of services; and up to five more members. The legislation provides for an independent review of the act after two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay credit to my elder sister who was a nun with the Josephites. She set up the first lance society in Australia. She was awarded an Order of Australia medal for her work there. Our family experience was of a child with a mental disability and it has certainly been a very strong part of my family's upbringing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2012. There are not many in this House that do not have some understanding of the hardship families experience in caring for those with a disability. My electorate of Wright is quite remote. It starts at the top of the Toowoomba Range and borders Robina on the Gold Coast. In an area like that we do not have an enormous amount of infrastructure to help or support families. As a rural and regional community we rely heavily on neighbours, friends and family to support those people in their hours of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will not be opposing the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I remind the House that we support this bill, as we do 83 per cent of legislation when we come into the House. This government would have you believe there is a relentless negativity from the opposition. That is factually not true. Public documents from the Parliamentary Library state that we have supported over 83 per cent of bills that have come before this House. What may not be known to those in the gallery today is that the coalition has requested a bipartisan committee to be formed on the National Disability Insurance Scheme so that we can move forward collectively with this. But no—as we move through, they will continue to take the single headline, the single grab, that 'the coalition are opposed to this' and that it is only Labor that will provide and deliver an NDIS. I say to you, Madam Speaker and those in the gallery, that nothing could be further from the truth. There are no lows to which this government will not go to hide the truth when it comes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on 15 February 2013, of the Honourable William Lawrence (Bill) Morrison AO, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of St George from 1969 to 1975 and 1980 to 1984, places on record its appreciation of his public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not so long ago that this House said farewell to Joe Riordan. Now we gather to pay tribute to another member of that remarkable band of brothers of the Whitlam cabinet. There were 32 who served during those three tumultuous years. Now, with Bill Morrison's passing, there are just 11 left. They were by any measure an extraordinary group: men of the greatest generation, many of whom served our nation in war, all of whom served our nation with distinction in peace; men whose brilliant careers were brought to an end by the Dismissal, except for Bill's. His career was not brought to an end. Bill Morrison returned to this House for two final terms between 1980 and 1984, enjoying the satisfaction of seeing Labor returned to the treasury benches—30 years ago this month. Not content with that return to federal politics, he followed that up with a stint in local government, in Rockdale Council, in the 1990s, a lovely way to conclude Bill's life in politics. And what an amazing life in politics it was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Morrison was a butcher's son—a craft he also learnt himself. Born in working-class Lithgow, he was raised on Sydney's northern beaches before they were fashionable. Hard work at school led him to a university scholarship. So, instead of following in Chifley's footsteps into the railways, as his father wanted, Bill graduated from Sydney university and joined the diplomatic service. In that job, he enjoyed a bit part in our country's greatest ever foreign policy imbroglio, the Petrov affair, being one of the three Australian diplomats expelled from Moscow in retaliation for Prime Minister Menzies giving asylum to the Petrovs. Bill famously demonstrated his displeasure to the Soviets in a way that is thoroughly unparliamentary to mention but would have left a lasting impression on anyone looking out of the Kremlin windows that night!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Morrison's diplomatic career flourished through the 1950s and 1960s. He was an early advocate for our engagement with Asia. He was bitterly opposed to the Vietnam War. He believed in multilateralism and the power of international engagement to resolve differences. Above all, he believed in a distinctly independent Australian voice on the world stage and did so much to articulate that voice in his own life and his own work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Morrison was serving as Australian Deputy High Commissioner to Malaysia when asked by Gough to contest the seat of St George in 1969, as Whitlam sought to renew and rebuild the Labor Party. Bill won the seat by one of the slimmest margins since Federation, just 69 votes—a result confirmed by five excruciating recounts. In 1972, Bill Morrison was appointed Minister for External Territories, which meant he was the minister responsible for guiding Papua New Guinea to self-government, which he did with much success. Bill later held the portfolios of science, defence and consumer affairs, as well as being Minister assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs. By every account, he was a good minister, intelligent, astute and thoughtful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the hurt of the Dismissal, Bill did a stint in academia before returning to this House. He was at that time pipped at the post for a ministerial vacancy and he retired from federal politics prior to the election of 1984. Bill's service to the Commonwealth continued in the role of Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, a post he held from 1985 to 1989. It was a fitting conclusion for a man whose career as a diplomat, politician and academic was overwhelmingly dedicated to foreign policy and to finding a creative role for Australia in the modern world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As usual, Alan Ramsey summed up Bill Morrison's life better than any of us could. He wrote of Bill:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He never lost his integrity, his idealism, his independence, his sense of humour, or his pants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, Bill Morrison was an adornment to this parliament and to our party. He enriched our nation and helped it grow up. He gave his best years to Australia, and now Australia says farewell to a good and faithful servant. To Bill's loving wife of 55 years, Marty; to their children, Tanya, Kim and Melanie; to their seven grandchildren; and to Bill's many colleagues and friends go the condolences of a grateful nation.</span>

As the Prime Minister has noted, Bill Morrison grew up on the northern beaches of Sydney—so he had the best possible start in life. He was, I am advised, a lifelong surfer, so he should have been a man well and truly at peace with himself. Obviously he was a fine diplomat, because, I am advised, he was expelled from Moscow not just once but twice—a remarkable achievement. Perhaps the Kremlin were aware of the earlier gesture to which the Prime Minister has alluded!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a minister, Bill Morrison helped to oversee the independence of Papua New Guinea, and, after retiring from the parliament, he was a well-regarded ambassador to Indonesia. Bill Morrison was one of a number of former diplomats who have been distinguished contributors to this place. He is in the company of such as Sir Paul Hasluck and the current member for Griffith. On behalf of the coalition I extend deepest condolences to his large family.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaker, Joan Child died just over two weeks ago, and since that death many fine words have been written and spoken about your great predecessor in this parliament. It is fitting that this House, over which she presided so well, should mark our condolence today. To those who knew her, Joan Child was bold, she was defiant, she was cheeky—she was Australian. She paved a path for Labor women, coming to this parliament in 1974 as the first Labor woman to sit in the House of Representatives. To some listening to this condolence debate today, that might seem like a very long time ago. But those of us in this chamber, I think, recognise that 1974 is not that long ago in the life of our nation, and it has been a remarkable journey since for women and their presence in this House of Representatives. Joan was one of the women who paved the way, and the dimensions of what has happened since in no way take away from the difficulty it must have been to be the first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joan, having been elected to this parliament, came here with a wealth of lifetime experience. She had been widowed young and left with five sons to raise on her own, and it was a formidable task to raise five sons by herself. But Joan not only did it; she did it whilst increasingly immersing herself in the life of her community and then, ultimately, in the life of her nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joan Child was a woman of very deep Labor conviction. She brought those convictions into parliament, and she pursued those convictions notwithstanding her loss of her seat. She determined to return to this parliament, and return she did. When she returned to this parliament, she commenced another journey: as the first woman to ever serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Given that her speakership coincided with Paul Keating at his best—in full flight—it was not an easy job. I am sure, Speaker, that you can recognise the difficulties, and there may be days that you return to your office grateful that Paul Keating is no longer here and no-one quite has that degree of engagement in question time. It is not an easy job—it takes wisdom and wit—but Joan Child showed that wisdom and wit at every stage of her speakership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joan Child is much loved in the Labor family and Labor community. I personally knew Joan Child, and she inspired in us fierce determination about carrying Labor convictions, the Labor cause and Labor campaigning. She is famous—indeed, some would say infamous—for the way in which she pursued postal votes in elections. She was a formidable campaigner. She was always determined to ensure that no-one marked a postal vote without the benefit of a Labor how-to-vote in their hand. This, on one occasion, meant that, because of a locked door, she climbed in through a bathroom window to ensure the delivery of that how-to-vote card. She was a formidable campaigner. I like to remember her that way—cheeky, defiant, always determined to do her best. I would not necessarily recommend that forthcoming members of parliament climb in through bathroom windows, but it does tell us a lot about Joan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She will be very sorely missed, including by her extended family: her five sons, their spouses and their extended family. We had the opportunity to pass on our condolences in person at the state funeral, and that family has so much to be proud of—as does the Labor Party, as does our nation.</span>

Joan Child, as the Prime Minster has already indicated, was one of the trailblazers for women in this parliament. As the Prime Minister has noted, when she was first elected to this House she was the only female member. It is hard to imagine that just over 30 years ago there was only one female member in this House. She went on to become this parliament's first female Speaker. You are following, Madam Speaker, in her distinguished footsteps. She was also the last Speaker in the old House, just down the road, as well as the first Speaker in this new chamber that we now occupy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am told that on one occasion, to punish members of parliament who had been disorderly in the parliamentary dining room, parliamentary staff began a work to rule and refused to collect payment from MPs. Instead of closing the facilities, Speaker Child declared that MPs would 'eat and drink for free'. This was a novel way of dealing with an industrial action—a very novel way indeed. Obviously, Speaker Child was a remarkable woman, a remarkable member of parliament. She will be much missed, and on behalf of the coalition I pass condolences to her family.</span>

It was a very special occasion as we celebrated a life well lived and ended all too soon. Peter Harvey, for millions of Australians, was the person who, with an unmistakable voice of authority, brought them the news, decade after decade. Indeed his sign-off 'Peter Harvey, Canberra'—I will not try and mimic the voice—is something that has so far gone into Australian consciousness and lexicon that it is now used by many as a way of noting a connection with Canberra events.</span>

He engaged in popular culture, whether it was on the red carpet interviewing actors, film stars or musicians or whether it was engaged in the human interest stories that tug at people's hearts or whether it was following the rough and tumble of politics. Peter Harvey was an exemplary journalist, always able to generate a script, which in a very pithy way brought home to people the emotions that he was seeking to convey.</span>

It was truly with a sense of loss that we sat there but also a sense of celebration about a life in which so much was achieved. He will be missed. He will be particularly missed by his wife, Anne, and by his children, Claire and Adam. Our condolences most sincerely go to them and their extended family.</span>

And then, of course, the cuts go on because of what the Leader of the Opposition has planned for schools and for hospitals and also the attacks that he has got planned on small businesses, with 120,000 small businesses—</span>

                  </a>  I was asked a lengthy question including references to cost-of-living pressures in Western Sydney, and I am addressing that part of the question. Important for families in Western Sydney is the flow-through of lower interest rates to the burden that paying the household mortgage is for families in Western Sydney, with the average mortgage now costing them $5,000 less per year than it did when the Leader of the Opposition was a minister in government. So, for cost-of-living pressures for people in Western Sydney, we are very concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that, though our nation has a resilient economy, for many families it can be very difficult to make ends meet, which is why we will keep working with families in Western Sydney and indeed around the nation: working to provide benefits like the schoolkids bonus; working to better support their childcare costs than they have ever been supported before; working to ensure that they continue to enjoy the benefit of tax cuts, with more than half a million people in Western Sydney having their tax cuts at risk as a result of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition; making sure that we help them at the time that a new baby is born, through paid parental leave both for mums and for dads, making sure that that special support is available; and, for those older citizens in Western Sydney, continuing to provide pensions at an increased level—indeed, having delivered a historic increase and then adding to it. So cost-of-living pressures for people in Western Sydney and around the nation are at the forefront of the government's policies and plans to work with modern families as they work their way through the stresses and strains of modern living.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On government budget matters: the budget will be unveiled in May. I trust that, on the Thursday when the Leader of the Opposition replies, he will stop running for cover and hiding—</span>

I thank him for the way in which he represents the communities within his electorate in this place, and I thank him for spending some time with me last week when I had the opportunity to spend a number of days in Western Sydney, something that I very much enjoyed. Whilst in Western Sydney I had the opportunity to meet with people in all sorts of settings from all walks of life, but one meeting actually reinforced in me very strongly the importance of the government's plan for the nation's future—the importance of our focus, our relentless focus, on ensuring we create jobs and bring opportunity to Australians around the nation, including in Western Sydney.</span>

Corey Payne has also engaged in getting a master's degree at Sydney university, and Corey Payne is running a charity that is there to inspire young people in Western Sydney—inspire them to be the first in their family to go on to higher education. In his company, I had the opportunity to meet Paolo and Elaine. Elaine and Paolo are both from Fairfield High School. Elaine, having studied there, is now enrolled at Sydney University. This is her first year and she is studying law. Paolo is still at Fairfield High School. He has set his sights on engineering at the University of New South Wales.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our national partnership money at Fairfield High School has worked with Corey Payne—his charity and his leadership—and the school's leadership to create new opportunities for these young Australians. Our national partnership money has facilitated the construction of a dedicated study area, now known to students at that school as the home of the 'nerd herd'. That is something that they wear as a badge of pride: they are students who are studying together with the dream and aspiration of being the first in their family to go to university. If you were trying to boil down into one life story the work of this government and the importance of our plan for Australia's future, it is this: making sure that young people, whether they are in Sydney's west or anywhere else around the nation, get the opportunity to have doors open to them, whether it is to university or to an apprenticeship or traineeship, so they can have the skills they need for their life. It is through that that we will be stronger, smarter and fairer nation. It was great to have some time to spend with these very impressive young Australians.</span>

I think it is the case that we have seen in the national accounts that the Australian economy is robust and that the Australian economy is resilient. It is also the case that we have seen a very unique set of circumstances emerge—particularly on the revenue side of our budget. This unique set of circumstances is driven by a combination of events that we have not seen in the economic history of our country: on one hand, a declining terms of trade, and on the other hand, a very high dollar. The consequence of that has been that there is a challenge to our revenue. At the end of last year, I very clearly made the point to the Australia people that this government's priority would always be to support growth and to support jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I made that point at the end of last year very deliberately, because it would have been deeply irresponsible of this government to cut harder, to cut back on jobs and growth, in the face of what was a very significant revenue downturn. That was the consequence of a set of events in our economy that we have not seen ever before. We have now seen nominal GDP growth go below real GDP growth for three quarters in a row. The point that I want to make is this: this government will always put jobs and growth first.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SWAN:</span>
                  </a>  Certainly. It brings me to the point that we will always support our economy when there is a threat to jobs and growth. Last year in the budget, what I outlined was the forecast for a whole range of indicators—such as growth and debt. I made the point very clearly then and outlined that we would bring these figures in within the debt cap that I outlined in last year's budget—and that remains. But there is a very clear choice here, because those opposite want to spread fear about debt. There is no doubt about that when we as a country have done so much better than just about every other developed economy in the world, because our priority was to support jobs and growth in our economy. We were opposed every step of the way by those opposite. If they would have had their way back during the global financial crisis, deficits would have been higher and so too would have been debt. Now, we are challenged again. The proposition that they are putting to the people of Australia is that, in the face of a revenue slowdown that we have seen, they would cut harder and hit jobs and growth.</span>

The responsible thing to do in the circumstances in which we have found ourselves, during the five-year period in which we have had the most turbulence we have ever seen in the global economy since the Great Depression, is to run a responsible fiscal policy—a responsible fiscal policy which supports jobs and growth and which puts it in the framework of a medium-term fiscal strategy that is a commitment on surpluses on average and across the cycle—and that commitment remains.</span>

Last week we had the national accounts, and our economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter—3.1 per cent through the year. This occurred at a time when the shadow Treasurer said that the economy was flatlining, and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the economy was yet to grow. The fact is that this is a great result for Australia, whichever way you look at it. But those opposite want to continuously talk our economy down. The fact is that more than half of the advanced economies around the world did not grow during that quarter, and we grew faster than every other developed economy bar one. This gets us to the point where our economy is 13 per cent larger now than it was prior to the global financial crisis. We know that not everybody is immune from these conditions in the global economy and there are sectors and families in our economy that are doing it tough. As I was saying before, we can see this in the unusual combination of events that are playing out in our economy: dramatically declining terms of trade on the one hand and a dollar which is staying stubbornly high. What that is doing is putting a squeeze on profits and income right across our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer wants everybody to believe that that is not happening, that, just as there was not a global financial crisis, these events are not playing out in our economy right now. But the fact is that they are having a dramatic impact on government revenues. Government revenues are down $6 billion since MYEFO. That will have an impact on this year and years beyond—of that there is no doubt. When the global economy takes an axe to revenues, the commitment of this government is not to take an axe to jobs and growth. That is the proposition that has been put by those opposite. In the face of all this, they are saying, 'Take an axe to jobs and growth.' We on this side of the parliament would never, ever do that, because we are committed to jobs and growth and supporting Australian families in jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition raised the question before of the cost of living. If you do not have a job, you cannot handle the cost of living. If the opposition had had their way during the global financial crisis, hundreds of thousands of Australians would be without jobs. Our policies during the global financial crisis supported growth and jobs, particularly for people in Western Sydney. We put Australian workers first. Those opposite always put them last.</span>

As I said before, we are putting in place our medium-term fiscal strategy and committed to surpluses, on average, over the economic cycle. That is the responsible thing to do. If the shadow Treasurer wants me to bring down the forecast for the May budget today, that simply cannot be done and he absolutely knows it. But what we on this side will give is a commitment to support jobs and growth. What we are seeing here very clearly today is a determination from those opposite to take an axe to our economy and to slash and burn, particularly across jobs, health and education. You get no clearer commitment to that than what the shadow Treasurer said in Western Sydney last week.</span>

Would the minister not agree that First Australians have been failed, a failure albeit exacerbated by provocation by the Queensland government, a continued position of discriminatory intervention and a refusal to provide perpetual freehold title—a right enjoyed by every Australian, and most people on earth, but not by First Australians? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  It is a very important issue and, of course, the Queensland government has recently opened up the question of alcohol management plans. This issue is open to very significant debate in Queensland. In fact, I met with the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and Multicultural Affairs just this morning. We talked about these issues and I made the point very clearly to him—and I will make it to the parliament today—that our priority is to make sure we reduce harm. That is what we are on about. That is the priority of this government—to make sure that Aboriginal women and children living in remote communities will no longer be subject to the level of alcohol induced violence that they have been subject to. That is our priority and it will continue to be so.</span>

The government supports the current arrangements where we have two-thirds of the permanent stream used for skilled migrants. That is a good thing and should continue. We support limited work rights for students and holiday makers and we support the legitimate use of 457s where there is a genuine skills shortage. However, there has been advice provided to me, as it was to my predecessor, that there are problems with the 457 scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first concern is the large gap between the 457 growth rate and the total employment growth rate. This is illustrated by a 68 per cent increase in 457s for workers in the information, communications and technology sector between 2008-09 and 2011-12. At the same time as this very significant rise in the applications that were granted we have seen nominal wage rates in these positions fall by five per cent for information professions and 12 per cent in technical professions. This is the nominal fall in the rate, so the real wage rate fall is even more dramatic than that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The positions for those 457 applicants now have lower wage rates than jobs that are currently filled by the permanent workforce in that sector. This is of deep concern to the government and it should be a concern for those opposite. That is why we need these reforms. We need to ensure that employers demonstrate a genuine need for 457 applicants. We need to ensure we demonstrate that they sought to employ local workers.

It does worry me that the former Premier of Victoria wrote to my predecessor, Minister Bowen, to seek changes to the guidelines of regional migration agreements so that Geelong can have an RMA applied to it, even though the unemployment figure in Geelong is higher than the national average. That is of deep concern to me. That is combined with the lethal cocktail of state Liberal governments cutting TAFE places across the state. What you have here is a situation where TAFE places are being reduced, young workers are not getting sufficiently trained and, at the same time, Liberal state governments are seeking to broaden the regional migration agreement guidelines in order to ensure that those local workers will miss out on getting those places. That is not the basis upon which the 457 scheme was to be implemented in this country. That is why we need these reforms. I thank the member for his concern—and I also thank the member for Corio, Richard Marles, for his concern—that workers in that area and in other areas across Australia have the opportunities first and that we use 457s only where there are genuine skills shortages.</span>

                  </a>  I was asked about 457 visas and I was starting by making the point that we inherited a system from those opposite that was out of control. Of course, a key difference between our policies and plans for the nation’s future and the Leader of the Opposition’s policies and plans is that we believe Australians should go first and we want to ensure, at every stage, that the visa system works to put Australians first. The Leader of the Opposition has a different approach and wants to make 457 visas a mainstay of the immigration system. So there is a clear policy difference and people can judge. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the data that has concerned me about 457 visa holders, 457 visa holders currently are at more than 100,000. This represents a 21.5 per cent increase compared to February in 2012. Having cracked down on this system once, those kinds of statistics do concern me and I believe it is time to crack down on this system again. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister for immigration has also made clear, I am concerned about the double whammy which comes when you have state Liberal governments which are cutting back access to training, undercutting our apprenticeship system, slamming the door in the face of young Australians who would seek to get skills, and then making representations to the federal government: 'Don't worry about those training places; don't worry about those apprenticeships for young Australians; don't worry about that access to opportunity. Could you assist us by expanding the short-term visa program for part of the state?' Well, no, that is not good enough, and it will never be good enough for training cutbacks to be used as a justification for then bringing in more people from overseas. </span>

We should always make sure we are putting Australians first in access to jobs and opportunity. That is what guides this government in our policies and it always will. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:58</span>):  I want to thank the member for Page for the question and acknowledge the advocacy of both the member for Page and the member for Richmond in their concerns about various proposals in the Northern Rivers area. This is an issue which has been raised by many members on this side and also very prominently by a number of members of the crossbench. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When a federal approval is given over a large coalmine or a coal seam gas project, the public expectation is that we have taken into account every possible impact on what it could mean for water, whether it be underground water or whether it be its connection to surface water. The reality of environmental approvals at the moment is, legally, an environment minister is not able to take all those issues into account. They are only able to take them into account to the extent to which there might be an endangered species downstream or to the extent to which, for example, there might be a Ramsar wetland downstream, and that is the knock-on effect. But the broad based, taking into account the full impact on a water resource, is something where the public expectation is that that is exactly what we do. The legal requirement falls far short of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We bridged the gap a fair way a year ago when I introduced legislation into this parliament which established the independent expert scientific committee. That made sure that the scientific work was being done to fully take into account all the potential impacts on water of these sorts of projects. Notwithstanding the work being done, it still fell short when you got to the approval process. We had data there that was not then able to be taken into account when we got to the decision at the federal level. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For that reason, I announced earlier today that the government will be introducing amendments to national environmental law and, in those amendments, we will be establishing a water trigger as one of the matters of national environmental significance. We obviously want to make sure that we are only hitting the very large water issues. We do not want to create a problem for anyone who wants to put in a farm dam or anything like that. For that reason, the same window that applies to the independent expert scientific committee will apply to this new matter of national environmental significance. That will be coal seam gas projects and large-scale coalmines. In doing this, we will then be able to make sure that the community expectation of what is taken into account and the work that we fund to be independently assessed are taken into account when it gets to the decision-making time. In transition processes, we are also making sure that projects that are already within the system do not have to go right back to the start on their environmental approval process. Simply going through the normal process of seeking additional information will make sure that we have a streamlined approach that does not add significantly to time lines for businesses that have already commenced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against all of this, we should be able to meet the actual community expectation: an approvals process where the rigorous work is done to make sure that all the data is taken into account for the impacts on underground and surface water and at the same time making that part of the decision.</span>

Indeed, I was with the member for Chifley and other Western Sydney members with the Prime Minister last week when we announced our commitment to help build the M5 and M4 extensions. We want to work with the New South Wales government to achieve real improvements to Sydney's motorways. The current New South Wales proposal has a number of weaknesses in it, and we are insisting that they be fixed. That is the way you do good infrastructure development: get your business plan in place first and then get your funding commitments made.</span>

                  </a>  That is a common-sense position that people in Western Sydney understand. That is why we have contributed $25 million, announced in last year's budget, to enable the business case to be developed: because it is very clear that we need to get the planning in the project right first time, in order to ensure there is proper use of taxpayers' funds.</span>

Next he said, in an op-ed in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span>, that the city connection would go only as far as Petersham. Next week it might be Ashfield. One thing I do know is that Camperdown and Petersham are not in the city. I do know that taking a freight connection to the side of Sydney airport closest to St Peters does not get freight to the port. King Street, Newtown, is not a thoroughfare; it is a roadblock. Unless we get this right the first time, it will simply fail.</span>

And yet, last week when asked whether it was a condition, he was not sure: it was; it was not; it was; it was not. He needs to come clean to the people of Western Sydney. They cannot have it both ways. You cannot have Premier O'Farrell saying, 'We're going to build a road to Petersham with federal money,' and have this Leader of the Opposition pretending that this road is going to take people into the city. He indeed has described his own commitment, which he has made in these advertisements, as being an impossible condition for federal funds. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I say, this is a very important area and it is very important that we have a public debate on it. As I have been advised by the department—and that advice was affirmed by the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration—we need to attend to the rorts. Quite simply, you either support the reforms or you support the rorts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Yesterday the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth and I were at the very impressive Macarthur Girls High School in Parramatta to announce our reforms to the quality of teacher training in Australia. Across Australia we have many thousands of dedicated and talented teachers, but, of course, we want to make sure we have the best possible teacher training in place for the future. That is why yesterday we announced the introduction of new, more rigorous standards for teacher training courses—to improve the quality of teachers graduating from universities in Australia. We want to improve the quality of our university teaching courses to make sure teachers have the required skills to be effective teachers, role models and leaders of our future generations. The four elements of the plan that the minister for school education and I announced yesterday are: more rigorous and targeted processes for admission into teaching courses; new literacy and numeracy tests that each student wanting to teach in Australia will need to pass before they are allowed to teach to ensure that they are in the top 30 per cent of literacy and numeracy; a national approach to teacher pracs so that teachers have the best possible classroom experience before they are admitted to teaching; and a review of teaching courses by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures will be implemented in close consultation with Universities Australia and with independent, individual universities. I am pleased with the strong support from universities that has been given to this plan. Universities have also made it clear that they oppose the announcements made recently by the New South Wales government in this space. Universities recognise that, while an ATAR or a HSC result is an important indicator of somebody's ability, it is not the only indicator. There is more that goes into determining a good teacher—including passion, commitment, empathy and a dedication to education. So, I do welcome the support of Universities Australia, the New South Wales Vice-Chancellors Group and the Australian Council of Deans of Education, who have all backed the announcements made by Minister Garrett and me yesterday. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that teachers can and do move between states and jurisdictions, and so a national approach is important. We also know that an ATAR cut-off is not the best indicator of who can be a great teacher. The New South Wales government's plans would be a retrograde step. But the measures we announced yesterday are not a retrograde step. They are a positive and forward approach, which ensures that our teachers will continue to be dedicated, committed and amongst the best trained in the world.</span>

If the Leader of the Opposition wants to stop people tweeting during question time, he should perhaps speak to many other people in this place. That would be my only comment on that. Obviously, during question time, I am not seeing what Twitter is saying. I am not on it for my own sanity and I would highly recommend everybody else getting off it for that very reason. I will investigate the matter. I have had concerns raised with me about the use of Twitter during question time and I take this matter very seriously.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  The member for Lyne, like many others, has not understood the system. Not all of the people taking seats in the gallery behind us need to be signed in. But I remind members of the gallery that they are not participants in question time and that calling out from the galleries will lead to a closing down. I think it would be an absolute disgrace if we had to curtail the rights of people to attend and see their own parliament. Like many Speakers and many members of parliament before me, I have had the privilege of going around the world and looking at other parliaments. I do not think people in Australia appreciate the access they have to this building and I would hate to get to the stage where we had to curtail that in any way. If people want to get to interject in question time, they have to get elected and get on a green seat—that would be my advice to individuals. Even then they would have to observe the standing orders which say, 'No interjections.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not to be outdone, at the National Press Club in 2007, his then shadow Treasurer said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not that Labor ever has delivered a surplus! The member for Griffith, the member for Lilley and the now Prime Minister are fingers on the same hand—they are all tinder dry economic conservatives so committed to delivering surplus budgets that they do not have to worry about debt or about putting anything on the national credit card. They were so unconcerned about their ability to properly govern the country that they introduced a bill—the Commonwealth Securities and Investment Legislation Amendment Bill. It was Chris Bowen, the member for Prospect, who introduced this. Remember that he was the author of a number of different watches—and he was not a watchmaker. He brought in Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch—all his ideas and he did such a great job with them! But little did the Treasurer know that the then Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs was issuing a debt limit bill. I suspect in the depths of my heart that the member for Prospect knew that Labor could not live within its means, so he wanted to put a little handcuff in there without the Treasurer knowing. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt. In his second reading speech he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government's commitment to strong fiscal discipline means that there is no need to issue debt securities to finance spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five years and $200 billion later, with a debt interest bill of over $12 billion a year, how those words must ring in the ears of the Labor Party. How those words about living within your means must ring in their ears. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are always quick to give Australians a lecture about how the Australian people should live within their means. 'But don't worry about us,' they say, 'We're borrowing money—and we are borrowing money because we   cannot deliver a surplus.' Labor has not delivered a surplus since 1989. The member for Longman, up the back there, was not even born in 1989. In his lifetime, he has never seen a Labor surplus—and I expect that, in his lifetime, he never will see a Labor surplus. And long may you live, Member for Longman. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that Labor do not know how to live within their means. They are like someone with a credit card who is out of control. When the member for Prospect introduced that prophetic bill, the Commonwealth Securities and Investment Legislation Amendment Bill, he said: 'Don't worry—we only need a $75 billion limit. That is all we need. Really that is a bit more than we need; we are going to have plenty left.' It is like a compulsive spender going into the bank and saying, 'Look, can you lend me 10 grand—I don’t need 10 grand; I'm only going to spend three or four but 10 grand is the limit I want; I want you to handcuff me.' And that is what they did. But then they feared they would exceed the limit, so they went from $75 billion to $200 billion in 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They said it was a financial crisis, a calamity. Okay, there was an impact on revenues—I fully accept that, and I always have. But $200 billion? They said at the time, 'Don't worry, it is the GFC—the GFC has done it; we've seen the worst of it and we've come through it because of what Labor has done.' Then, in 2011, three years after the GFC hit the budget, they said, 'Two hundred billion is not really enough; we need to increase our debt limit.' So they go back to the bank—the parliament—and say, 'Two hundred billion is not enough; can we take it to $250 billion?' We said, 'Hang on, you said $200 billion was the limit, and before that you had said $75 billion was the limit. What is your limit?' They said, 'No, $250 billion is the limit; that is the limit we will legislate for.' They were supported by their mates, the Independents, and the Greens. The Greens would have a trillion dollars if they could. The bottom line was that they said $250 billion was the limit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, along comes the Treasurer. He says, 'Good news, Australia—we are going to run a surplus. We are going to live within our means and we are going to pay it all back by the end of the decade. But, hey, can you increase the limit to $300 billion? We are not sure, we might exceed $250 billion, but I give you a guarantee'—as he did in this place—'that at the end of the financial year we will not get above $250 billion; we will just pop up and down because we have different debt issuance instruments, and the timing is a bit here and there, but don't worry, we will not exceed $250 billion at the end of the financial year but we need to go to $300 billion.' So now we are just a few weeks from the end of the financial year and the debt is $263 billion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Speaker, we asked the most simple questions, and you bore witness to them. You were in the chair, Madam Speaker, and you heard that our questions of the Treasurer were simple and straightforward: 'Will you keep your word that the debt will not exceed $250 billion this year?' He could not answer the question. It was agony to watch—it was painful. Anyone watching in the gallery or on TV must have been aching just a little bit for the Treasurer. But not me. I know, and I suspect all of my colleagues know, that at the end of the day it is the taxpayers who have to pay back this debt. At the end of the day, someone has to pay this money back. They cry crocodile tears about cost-of-living pressures on Australians and yet they keep jacking up the taxes—27 new or increased taxes since they have come in. Not to be outdone, the Prime Minister has declared that she is going to introduce a tough budget. We know what a tough budget means—it is tough for the taxpayer. The Labor Party has no respect for taxpayers. But the Labor Party have no respect for the meaning of their words—they are just words; just spin. They have no regard for the impact of their decisions on everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have confessed to a couple of friends here that my old mate Peter Costello—he remains a very good mate—said to me, '$250 billion is quite an ask, Joe.' I said, 'Do you know what, Peter, it is quite an ask. And, by the way, when Labor last left office they left a $96 billion debt, but there was a Telstra to sell, a Qantas to sell'—not that it is worth as much as it once was—'and a range of different assets to sell. I haven't got any assets to sell if I become the Treasurer.' The NBN? I could not give it away. If anyone wants to buy the NBN for one dollar, it is for sale right now. Come on, Emmo—a gold coin will do it. The CEFC? What is left? There is nothing left. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you what we are left with—as of today, $263 billion of debt, and $12 billion a year in interest payments, which is more in interest each year that the Commonwealth government has to find than the entire yearly proceeds of capital gains tax in Australia. It is four times the total collection of fringe benefits tax each year. It is far more than the carbon tax—in fact, it is more than the carbon tax and the mining tax combined. That revenue alone would not meet the interest bill on the Labor Party's debt. They say not to worry about it; the rest of the world is in great shape. But when they compare us with the rest of the world they are comparing us with Europe. Gee, Europe is doing well; it is a cracker. European countries are benchmark states for us. That is exactly who we should be comparing ourselves to! Or the United States, with its fiscal cliff. They are doing really well, too, with unemployment hovering around nine per cent. Using the United States for comparison is a great idea! Maybe Japan? How well is Japan doing? It has been in a cocoon for a decade or more, and yet those opposite compare us with Japan. They compare us with the slowest runners in the field, at a time when we should be the fastest runner in the field.</span>

                  </a>  Don't interject, old son—listen carefully. When you compare us to the fastest runners in the field, Australia with its11.6 per cent of GDP debt compares with Norway, whose debt is minus 169 per cent. That means they have more savings and they have not got any debt. Finland's debt is minus 51 per cent of GDP, and Sweden's debt is minus 17½ per cent of GDP—but, no, the government says we have been hit really hard by a loss of revenue. So I thought, 'Well, how do we compare?' I go back to Norway. Norway improved by 45.8 per cent over the last five years. Finland was roughly stable. Sweden improved 5.1 per cent. Our debt deteriorated 17 per cent. So who are they comparing us with?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does Labor keep doing this? Why does Labor embrace mediocrity? Why does Labor embrace the lowest common denominator, when you should compare us to the best? Because we want Australia to be best. We do not want to be second best or third best; we want our nation to be the best that it can be. We want our nation to be the best in the world, and we want to ensure that our children start at the top of the mountain, not at the bottom of the mountain. We want to ensure that we give the next generation and those beyond a better quality of life—an even better quality of life than that which we have. Yes, we have a better quality of life than our parents and our grandparents, and so it should be. But we owe that to others. Why? That is the way humanity should run. We should aim to be better. We should aim to leave a better legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons why this debt level from Labor hurts so much is the terms of trade: the demand for what is in our ground or in our oceans is far greater now than it has been at any other time in our history. The terms of trade are higher now than any day during the previous, Howard government. Yet it was the Howard government that had to pay off Labor's $96 billion of debt and left $60 billion to $70 billion of extra money available, and it is Labor that comes in and spends all of that and then keeps adding to the debt bill so that we have over $263 billion to try and repay. You know what, Madam Deputy Speaker—Mr Speaker—Mr Deputy Speaker—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83V" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr EMERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade and Competitiveness and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Asian Century Policy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  This matter of public importance is a welcome debate because we are witnessing a sharp contrast between the position of the Labor government and that of the coalition in opposition, and that contrast is this: Labor consider that the economy is strong and that the economy can be strengthened further, and we are implementing policies to do that in order to secure jobs for the working men and women of this country and for the young generations coming through, while the coalition consider that the economy is ailing, it is sick and it needs the sort of radical surgery that the shadow Treasurer just outlined—savage cuts to government spending, and big tax increases. I will substantiate my arguments by going through, one by one, the areas where they would cut and the areas where they would increase taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note that the shadow Treasurer, in his opening remarks, declared that he is a good mate of Peter Costello. Peter Costello has been in the news in the great state of Queensland recently, yet again, and the reason is that he has overseen the preparation of a second audit commission report. The first audit commission report contained cuts in government services that were not outlined by Premier Newman before the Queensland state election. The second audit commission report contains recommendations for the privatisation of government services, including hospital services. So, when I speak of the radical surgery that the coalition considers essential because it believes the economy is ailing, you need look no further than the second audit commission report, where the coalition—the LNP in Queensland—under the recommendations of the shadow Treasurer's good mate, is proceeding to cut vital hospital services. This points to the fundamental difference between Labor in government and the coalition in opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor in government note that, here in Australia, we are growing faster than any other major advanced country; the unemployment rate is relatively low; and the official inflation rate is low. Interest rates, the Reserve Bank cash rate—which went up 10 times after the coalition government promised in the 2004 election to keep interest rates at record lows—have fallen from 6¾ per cent under the coalition government to three per cent. That means, for a mortgage holder with a $300,000 mortgage, a saving of $5,000. We consider that to be good. The coalition considers all of these indicators to be the signs of an ailing and sick economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We consider that investment at 50-year highs is a sign of a healthy economy. The coalition considers that the Australian economy is weak and ailing and in need of radical surgery. We consider the fact that three international ratings agencies, for the first time in Australia's history, have rated Australia triple A and stable to be an indicator of a strong economy. The coalition considers this to be an indicator of a weak and ailing economy that needs radical surgery. We consider car sales going through the roof to be a sign of a healthy economy. The coalition considers car sales going through the roof as evidence of an ailing and weak economy. We consider a pick-up in consumer confidence to be a good sign, along with a surging stock market and improving retail sales and house prices—all indicators of a strong economy that is getting better. The coalition considers these things indicators of a weak economy—a sick and ailing economy—which needs radical surgery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is through the device that the coalition have already supported in Queensland that they would pursue their radical surgery. I refer, of course, to the shadow Treasurer's mate Peter Costello and his device of an audit commission. The coalition, in opposition federally, have said that they would have an audit commission just as Campbell Newman has had an audit commission in Queensland. The reason they want to have an audit commission is that they want to conceal from the Australian people, just as Campbell Newman tried to conceal from the Queensland people, savage cuts to services and to jobs; they do not have the wit or the courage to explain to the Australian people where they would make their savage cuts to what they consider to be a sick and ailing economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition leader's Liberal Party, in contrast to the Liberal Party of the member for Wentworth, propose policy prescriptions such as $180 billion in cuts to government spending. The shadow Treasurer referred to the global financial crisis—at last he has acknowledged that it did occur—but this opposition leader's Liberal Party are saying that, when there was a hit during the global financial crisis of $180 billion to government revenue, the opposition would have cut spending commensurately. They would have matched a $180 billion write-down of government revenue with $180 billion in cuts to government spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer now to statements by the shadow education minister, who said late last year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, if there had been a Coalition government for the last five years, Kieran, I think most people accept that we would have had continuing surpluses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is my point—they would have matched the $180 billion write-down in taxation revenue with a $180 billion cut in expenditure. The shadow Attorney-General said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, we think the budget should never have been put into deficit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this indicates that they would have matched $180 billion in government revenue cuts with $180 billion of cuts to government spending. What would such cuts have inflicted on the Australian people? They would have inflicted a deep and prolonged recession. That is why I think the Australian people should rightly be fearful of a coalition that are led by this opposition leader. A cut of $180 billion in government spending is an example of the cuckoo policy prescriptions they have in mind for the Australian people and for the Australian economy, which they consider so sick and so ailing that it needs radical surgery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the mouth of the opposition leader that his preferred policy prescription for dealing with the GFC was a recession for Australia. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For instance, in New Zealand they have tried to reform their way through the global financial crisis under the new government's leadership, and they seem to be doing pretty well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what happened in New Zealand? There was a recession that lasted five quarters—1¼ years. That is what happened in New Zealand, and that is the policy prescription of the current Leader of the Opposition, supported by the shadow Treasurer. When they lecture us on ensuring that we have responsible fiscal policy they ought to look at their own admissions, because they personally have admitted that they already have a $70 billion funding hole. The opposition leader said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, this $70 billion figure is a fanciful figure. It is plucked from the air by government ministers and I'm surprised you're retelling it to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who gave the $70 billion figure? It was the shadow finance minister. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The $70 billion is an estimate of the sort of challenge that we will have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The $70 billion is an indicative figure of the challenge that we've got.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was asked:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Is it a furphy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He replied:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No, it's not a furphy. We came out with the figure, right?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the coalition admitting that they have a $70 billion funding hole—and they have been trying to plug the hole ever since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently the shadow Treasurer has been fluffing his lines. The coalition know that they are going to make, through the concealed device of an audit commission, the $180 billion in cuts. When talking about the fact that they would remove the mining tax if they were elected, the shadow Treasurer was asked by a journalist:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What about the hole in the money?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The expenditure against it is going to go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had already mentioned, in the same context, the government's increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, so he was saying that the increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent will go if the coalition is elected. The journalist then asked him:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So what would you cut?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">So you would cut all those initiatives?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer answered:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So he was saying, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, that the opposition would cut the nine per cent to 12 per cent increase in the superannuation guarantee. But, by the time the six o'clock news put what he said to air, he tweeted to reprimand <span style="font-style:italic;">National Nine News</span> for reporting what he had said—the words that came out of his own mouth. The shadow Treasurer said, in a moment of candour, that the increase in super from nine per cent to 12 per cent would go under a coalition government. Of course, what he said was repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition because the Leader of the Opposition did not want the smelly cat out of the bag before an audit commission. But the cat is out of the bag—and a dirty, smelly creature it is. The coalition would cancel the increase in superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. They were the words that came out of the mouth of the shadow Treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it gets worse. In only the week just gone, the shadow Treasurer discussed the tax-free threshold. I refer to the increase in the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 which has liberated more than one million Australians from being taxpayers; it has taken more than six million Australians out of the tax system and offered them cuts of more than $300 a year.</span>

                  </a>  I am reading from a transcript. I know that members opposite do not think that transcripts have any credibility. Certainly the member for Forde does not believe a transcript has any credibility and neither does the shadow Treasurer, because he expunges embarrassing material from transcripts. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was asked about the tax-free threshold and he actually said, '$3. That is what you said'—turning to the Liberal candidate for Parramatta—'$3.' It is not $3; it is $300, and that part of the transcript was expunged. Why? Because, again, the shadow Treasurer tripped up on his words. He let that dirty cat out of the bag, that dirty, smelly cat, and the opposition leader said, 'Put the stinking creature back in the bag because that is going to come out if we get elected, through the audit commission process after an election.' We know that the shadow finance minister has said that they have got all their policies. They are already costed. They are all ready to rock-and-roll. He said: 'We have identified 49 errors of policy. I have got on my desk 49 policy documents with covers'—very nice covers, apparently—'and the costings.' But, of course, once they get a bit of pressure on the costings, they then run away and seek refuge in this audit commission.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the truth of the matter? The truth of the matter is that they have these policies, but they have personally said that they are going to wait until after the budget in order to reconcile. Then they said they were going to wait 10 days into the actual election campaign. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, 'No, no, we're going to wait until 30 September for the final budget figures,' which is after the election. The truth is that they would wait for this audit commission to make all of these errors add up through the savage cuts that they would deliver. Of course, they have form. We know that last time they botched it to the tune of an $11 billion funding hole. And, on 12 February this year, the shadow Treasurer was asked:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to where I started: we believe that the Australian economy is fundamentally sound. We can strengthen it further. It does not need the sort of radical surgery that the coalition believe it needs and want to conceal from the Australian people until after the election. The Australian people deserve better. They deserve accountability. They will continue to get that from the Gillard Labor government. The cowardice of the coalition in saying, 'We'll do it after an election,' is unacceptable, and this economy does not need the radical, savage surgery that they have in mind for it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance: the failure of the government to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position. It is good to follow the Minister for Trade, but I cannot say that much of what he detailed here in the chamber was relevant to the topic. Perhaps he could have been more relevant if he gave us one of his 'improv' karaoke renditions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Horror Movie</span>—and maybe it could be in tune this time—because a horror movie is really what we have got with Australia's current fiscal position. Indeed, it is because of that that it is a matter of urgent public importance. The fiscal mess that this government is creating is a mess that the public will be left to clean up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's debt is tomorrow's taxes. Our children will pay the price of this government's reckless waste through taxes and lost opportunities. This government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s failure to address Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s deteriorating fiscal position is this government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s selling-out of our children<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s future. But, according to the Treasurer, 'That's not a problem.' Our escalating debt is not a problem, he reckons: 'Move along—nothing to see here.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to know why this Labor government is failing to address the problem, it is because it denies there is a problem in the first place. Here is what the Treasurer said about this nation<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s debt—the excuse for incompetence that he dusts off and trots out on a weekly basis. He says, 'Compare with other major advanced economies.' He just loves to compare Australia to a handful of the worst performing economies in the world—not the big resource economies that are out there like ours but the ones that are floundering and are currently groaning under enormous debt levels. That is his aim. That is where he wants us to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He knows we are a long way back, but, boy oh boy, he is trying to catch them. It was a late start, because he had to overcome the handicap of actually having some cash in the bank and a strong economy when he took the reins, but he is coming—he is coming through with a late surge! He has got the blinkers on and he is riding that one-trick pony home, and he is going to catch them. He is! And here is how much he is gaining on them. In the outline of the economy, he laments the fact that the size of the task before him might actually be beyond him. He says: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Even at its peak, net debt will be a tiny fraction of the average of the major advanced economies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was this encouragement from the cheer squad, the Prime Minister, in a speech to the Queensland Media Club on 12 October 2012, where she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's debt is lower than any major advanced economy—our net debt will peak at 6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us skip ahead to what the Treasurer said in MYEFO, the mid-year budget update in October last year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The average net debt position of the major advanced economies is projected to peak at 95 per cent of GDP in 2016, almost 10 times higher than the expected peak in Australia's net debt of 10.0 per cent of GDP in 2011-12.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, from October 2010 to October 2012, Labor<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s forecast for net debt changes from six per cent to 10 per cent of GDP. He is catching them. He is coming in with a late run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that those opposite actually have no idea when net debt will peak, because in government Labor will never see net debt peak; it will just keep going up and up, because they have got no idea how to stop it from growing. It is very easy, Wayne: just spend less than what you earn. There are seven million households in Australia, in the real Australia out there, who understand that fact. But the world<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s luckiest Treasurer, or whatever <span style="font-style:italic;">Euromoney</span> magazine named him, cannot quite grasp that fact. Poor old Swanny. He cannot get his head around how a household budget actually works, and he wants to. He tries really, really hard. I can picture him, sitting there at the kitchen table, doing his homework with a firm grip on the crayon and a wrinkled brow, biting his tongue. And, after much constipated endeavour, he works his sums hard enough to come up with the debt analogy that he loves the most. Even the Prime Minister has picked it up and run with it. I return to a quote of hers that I used earlier, from the Queensland media club, where she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… our net debt will peak at 6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 …</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her next line was straight out of Swanny Junior's big book of sums. She said that that was:</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CHRISTENSEN:</span>
                  </a>  I am sorry—it was straight out of the Treasurer Junior's big book of sums:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, that is what she said. A couple of months earlier, the Treasurer used the same line in a doorstep. On 4 August 2010, when net debt was at six per cent, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That’s the equivalent of someone who’s earning $100,000 a year borrowing $6,000 a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on 22 November 2011, we had the then Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation upping the ante:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Commonwealth government debt is at seven per cent. That is the equivalent of $7,000 out of a GDP of $100,000.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the latter half of the next year the Treasurer was crowing on ABC on 16 October 2012:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our debt in international standards is very, very low. It's like someone earning $100,000 a year owing a modest $10,000 …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Up and up it goes, and that is lovely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the problem is that comparing your debt to everyone else's is not a very good analogy. Viewing debt as a percentage of GDP might be useful if you are comparing it with other countries'—especially if the other countries have similar economies that are resource based. But to use the figures to compare to a mortgage is just as reckless as your spending—as the government's spending, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, not yours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">GDP is produced by everyone. The seven million households out there have their own debts to worry about, and when their mortgages are paid off they will actually have a house. But what will the government have? What the Treasurer will have to service his debt is government income, raised mainly through taxes. Government income, which can be used to service government debt, was $329.9 billion in 2011-12. That is what we collected in revenue last year: $329.9 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us take the Treasurer to the bank manager and see if he can get a loan like the one he describes as 'tiny' and 'very, very low'. Let us imagine Mr Swan saying to the bank manager, 'I want a loan for $144 billion, Mr Bank Manager.' That is the net debt that we have currently. The bank manager: 'Certainly, Mr Swan; what was your income last year?' Mr Swan: 'It was roughly $330 billion.'</span>

The bank manager: 'Certainly, Mr Treasurer; what was your income last year?' The Treasurer: 'It was around $330 billion.' The bank manager: 'Okay, Mr Treasurer. Let's go through your actual expenditure. Oh boy! It looks like you've got a lot of dependants. I've got down here that you've got a lot of welfare recipients. Foreign aid's increasing. You're letting other people into your household as well—asylum seekers. You're increasing expenditure on that. I see that you've bought some school halls and the value of them is about half of what you actually paid for them. And what's this purchase here for flammable pink batts? What's that all about, Mr Treasurer?' After the bank manager has gone through the books and had a look at all the expenditure, he turns to the Treasurer and says: 'So, Mr Treasurer, what was your expenditure actually last year?' And the Treasurer mumbles something. The bank manager says: 'What was that, Mr Treasurer?' The Treasurer: 'Oh, it was about $374 billion.' The bank manager: 'That's about $43 billion more than you actually earned. You are spending more than you have earned. Mr Treasurer, how are you going to actually pay back this loan that you are trying to get from me?' The Treasurer: 'Oh, that's easy. I'll just come back to you and get another loan and I'll pay the interest off with that.'</span>

That loan will get even bigger next year. He will raise the debt ceiling again and borrow more money to pay that interest. We see something from the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> today where they actually state that:</span>

                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, discussing in particular Australia's fiscal position. In doing so I follow on from Dr Emerson, my next-door neighbour, who is the minister at the table. I would like to contrast his contribution with those of the member for Dawson and the member for North Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know the member for North Sydney's electorate that well, though I think I have been in his electorate. I know that if I stand in the southern part of his electorate I am in Kirribilli. So I have been there once, for a function—I think with the minister, in fact—with the Chinese community. If you stand in the southern bit of my electorate you are in Acacia Ridge, which is quite a different part of the world. But I know that when I am in Acacia Ridge talking to the people about debt and what sort of debt is manageable—and I refer to the member for Dawson talking about the seven million households in Australia and how we should approach debt—most people understand that debt is not a bad thing. Debt, in fact, can change your circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have here a newspaper story from Simon Benson from June 2010 talking about the Leader of the Opposition taking out a mortgage for $710,000 for his house. Even for someone in their 40s or 50s, as the Leader of the Opposition would have been when he took out this loan, debt is not necessarily a bad thing. It is good if you can keep interest rates under control. So I am sure the opposition leader would be thankful that, under this government, the interest that he is paying on that mortgage has probably halved in the time that we have been here. I think we even gave him a pay rise as well. So I am sure he is very thankful for that to this side of the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83V" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Dr Emerson:</span>
                  </a>  He has not mentioned it!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                  </a>  He has not mentioned it, but I am sure as a good Christian that he would mention it at the appropriate time. The reality is we need to put everything in context, like the spin that comes out of the member for North Sydney—we need to put things in context. We need to remember that Australia has a $1.3 trillion national economy. We are not just talking about a small trucking business and not just talking about one household: we are a nation with an economy of $1.3 trillion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we look at some of the other countries. The member for Dawson said, 'You should compare our situation to comparable countries, like resource-rich countries such as Canada.' He did not mention Canada, but obviously that is very comparable in terms of size, resources and population. Canada is very comparable. As I read through the list of significant countries in terms of GDP growth, we outdo the lot. In fact, I think the only one that is outperforming us that is comparable would be Taiwan, which is good for some of the constituents in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are compared to Norway or Sweden—as mentioned by the member for North Sydney—or to the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom or France, we are outperforming those countries. The reality is we are outperforming these countries. We have had 3.1 per cent growth and 0.6 per cent in the December quarter. However, what do we hear from those opposite? If they are overseas, they say that it is good. But no, because they are here, we hear the member for North Sydney say that our economy is flatlining. It is out and out misleading the public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the Leader of the Opposition say that it did not grow. It did grow 3.1 per cent, but he says that it did not grow. The member for Dawson calls it a 'horror movie'. It must be like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Scary Movie</span> version of a horror movie, because the reality is that when our economy grows like that it actually brings smiles to people's faces. Obviously, there are some stresses and this high Australian dollar is obviously something of concern. It is nice if you are an importer and your business is selling tires or something like that—as I inspected at one of my businesses yesterday. But to have a high dollar and these declining terms of trade is obviously something that is of concern to the government. Obviously, we could take a leaf out of the John Howard a playbook. If we taxed at their rates of taxing, we would have an additional $30 billion in taxes per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83V" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Dr Emerson:</span>
                  </a>  Easily in surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, in surplus in five, six or seven years easily if we taxed at the rate that John Howard did, which has a record in history as the highest taxing government ever at 24.2 per cent of GDP. Instead, we have made the decision to be a much lower taxing government at 22 per cent of GDP. Sadly, obviously the reality is that no government in more than 30 years has run a surplus with a tax to GDP ratio below 22 per cent. That does bring some strains and stresses to the government, but obviously we are not hearing those opposite say that we should be taxing at the same rate as John Howard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do know what we should do. The member for Dawson said that we would have nothing to show at the end of the process and compared acquiring a house to what the government does. I can tell you what we do: we invest in education, we invest in the NBN and we invest in infrastructure. I want to return to those three points, because the member for Dawson—so typical of people down here in Canberra—mocked our investment in education and insulation. Of course, he goes to the school facilities that have had their curriculum improved and that have had their quality of educational delivery improved, and he mocks the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, we have the Leader of the Opposition make that incredible statement during his contribution that he would nationalise the NBN if he was in power. He did not say that term, but he forgot that the government does not actually own the NBN. He said that he would effectively nationalise the NBN and then sell it for $1. That was his offer; it is on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> today. He did not realise that that is the major contribution that this government is making to improving productivity. It was ironic to have someone from the region—the Mackay area—not mention the NBN and the contributions that it makes to the local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of productivity, I well remember that when we took office in 2007—the member for Petrie and I were elected on 24 November 2007—productivity for that December quarter was at zero. That is not all the fault of the Howard government, admittedly. I know it does fluctuate a little bit. But the reality is that now we are starting to improve productivity, because—as everyone knows—productivity drives growth in living standards. We have got a bit of a pick-up in labour productivity. In fact, the labour productivity in the market sector grew by 3.3 per cent over the year to December, which is well above the 1.5 per cent average annual growth rate over the last 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Productivity is a sure indicator as to whether the economic engine is tuned correctly. Anyone that understands economics understands that you just cannot cut wages, which is the Work Choices way—the lazy way—of bringing improvements to the economy. You cannot make people work harder by cutting their wages—that just does not work. You have got to be smart about it. What do you do? You invest in infrastructure. It is a disgrace to have one of the economic brains of those opposite come in and say, 'I guarantee that I will nationalise the NBN and then sell it for $1.' I would like him to go to the Islamic college in the minister's electorate and tell them that the NBN is not worth anything. I say that because I received over 1,000 letters from the students in that school saying that they want the NBN rolled out faster to them, because they understand the jobs of the future will not necessarily be in their neighbourhood but will be throughout the Asian region. How do we engage with the Asian region? We invest in the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="99931" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Craig Kelly:</span>
                  </a>  Which private company owns the NBN?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                  </a>  It is not the government. The reality is that it is not actually owned by the government. For the Leader of the Opposition to commit to nationalising that company and to then sell it off for $1—and for the snickers to come from those opposite—shows that those opposite do not get technology. The reality is the digital age is upon us. I know we have a Leader of Opposition who says: 'I do not get technology. I do not worry about banking.' They go into the bank with their little passbook and say, 'This is the way to do things.' We need to invest in productivity, the NBN and the infrastructure in schools. That is what we need to do to improve our economy and make sure that we maintain this strong position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Dawson said we should be compared to other countries, and the member for North Sydney said we should be compared to other countries. I think the member for North Sydney mentioned Sweden and Finland. When you look at their actual GDP growth, when you look at their unemployment, when you look at the size of their economies and not just the fact that they have got some particular resources, Australia comes out ahead by a mile. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance, which is about the failure of the government to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position. It is always good to follow the member for Moreton. He has given a brief description of his electorate in Queensland, so I might take the opportunity to give a brief description of my electorate in Western Australia. Before I do that: I do not think it has been mentioned today in the chamber that there was an election in Western Australia on the weekend. Part of what the incumbent government in Western Australia went out to the population with was that Western Australia is heading in the right direction and now is not the time to take the risk of changing the government. Despite leading a minority government, Colin Barnett's leadership is providing certainty and direction to the state's economy. That is something this federal Labor government fails to do—provide certainty and direction to our national economy. Barnett's leadership and determination has ensured that Western Australia has remained secure and prosperous during difficult economic times. By standing up for our state, we Liberals are leading our country and leading the world. Whether it is through jobs, access to better health services at state-of-the-art hospitals, a revitalised city centre—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr IRONS:</span>
                  </a>  If the member does not want to hear about it, he is welcome to leave the chamber. Whether it is through support for the vulnerable and disadvantaged; new train carriages; more police and new laws to help them; new and upgraded roads and highways; or a new world-class sports stadium, the Liberals make decisions and get things done. They are securing Western Australia's future. I believe the Minister for Defence said there was a federal drag on the election for WA Labor—they will not even mention 'ALP'; they just call themselves WA Labor. Anyway, Western Australians have made their choice. They have chosen security, certainty and direction in their state economy, which unfortunately this federal government cannot provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the member for North Sydney speak today. He started off talking about Mr Rudd, Mr Swan and Ms Gillard, who described themselves as economic conservatives and promised to keep the budget in surplus. The member for Longman, who is sitting in front of me, has never seen, and probably will never see, a Labor surplus. For the member for Longman, let us hope that, one day, Labor will keep their promises. At the moment, they are failing to do that, and they are failing to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position. They keep going with the same policies, driving us further into debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard the member for North Sydney talk about the credit card limit—and the member for Dawson also mentioned it—and how we have gone from a debt ceiling of $75 billion to a debt ceiling of $300 billion. Is that something to be proud of? Is that something that the government should put on their CV and say, 'This is the right direction for any country to head in'—into a ridiculous debt situation? And we heard the member for Moreton continually quoting about the Howard government. That was nearly six years ago, but he kept talking about them. He never once mentioned that there was a $20 billion cash surplus with the Howard government at that particular time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard the member for North Sydney mention that this is taxpayers' money, not the government's money. That is what this is all about—the failure of this government to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal position. All it has to worry about is spending the money, not earning the money. It talks about a reduction in income tax from businesses. But, if you look at the way the PAYG system works, businesses are still paying their tax on last year's income. They are paying their forward tax, as you know—and I can see the Minister for Trade. I know that because I am doing it myself. My company is still paying tax on profits that were made two years ago; we are still paying it as we are going through. So you are still getting the income. But what is going to happen at the end of this financial year, when companies are not paying the same level of corporate tax? The government is going to have to repay all that money to those companies who have not made the same profits they were making one or two years ago. I am sure that has been allowed for in the budget as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the House that Labor has produced the four biggest budget deficits on record, totalling $170 billion. We have now heard that there will also be a deficit in 2012-13. We have heard more than 500 times the government promise that it is going to achieve a surplus for all that time and for this particular year. We also know that the net interest payments are close to $12 billion per year. This government's expenditure has risen from just over $250 billion under the Howard government to over $350 billion this financial year. That is not a bad rise in spending—$100 billion within five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also heard that we are $263 billion in debt. How are we going to deal with that? Have we heard from this government how it is actually going to address that deteriorating fiscal position? We have heard two speakers from the government side, and they have said nothing about addressing the situation that this MPI is about. They have talked about the history. They compare themselves to Europe and other countries that are behind Australia's benchmarking, but they never want to benchmark us against countries that are better than us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last sitting we heard the member for Moncrieff, Steven Ciobo, ask the Treasurer a question about the mining tax, which is particular to Western Australia. I call it the WA tax. He asked:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Given the mining tax has raised just $126 million its first six months of operation, when will the Treasurer face the fact that all his revised tax has achieved is that his credentials have indeed been shot to pieces?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lilley, the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, answered:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is the case that, in the second half of last year, which coincided with the first two quarters of the MRRT, there was a huge crash in resource prices. The consequence of that has been less revenue. … All of our profit based taxes—company tax, capital gains tax, superannuation tax, resource rent taxes—have taken a very substantial hit from global volatility at the end of last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is something that he has to deal with. He could not foresee that and kept saying, 'I promise: this surplus is definitely going to happen. There are no ifs or buts: it will happen.' It never happened, and it is not going to happen. It just will not happen. So we need to hear from this government how they are going to address the deteriorating fiscal policy situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also asked the Treasurer a question about the Gateway project, which again he tied in an interview in 2012 on 6PR to the mining tax. That is an expenditure of $685 million for the Gateway project in my electorate in Western Australia and he said it is in the budget bottom line. If it is tied to the mining tax and you are not getting an income from the mining tax, how are you going to pay for it? We hear, 'More debt, more debt.' We are going to borrow money from overseas again to pay off a project that was tied to the mining tax. Again we hear the government talking about how well they can manage the economy when they cannot even get the funding right for the small—actually it is a pretty decent size—Gateway project in Western Australia, in my electorate. We would like to get an answer from the government on how they are going to address Australia's deteriorating fiscal policy. We have had an answer that says nothing at all and just talks about the fact that it is in the budget bottom line, which we know it is not. We know it is not there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, as I said before, we have a government that provides security and confidence in the economy, a government for the people of Western Australia to vote for—and that is what we achieved on Saturday. Now all we would like to see from this federal government is the same strict fiscal policies that will create the surplus for this nation which we are still waiting to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Dawson talked about family budgets. People have been coming up to me at various places around the electorate saying that this is a government you could not put in charge of your own household budget because they just have no way of controlling spending and no way of budgeting correctly to provide Australia with a secure and certain future in the economy. In summary, I would like to say in support of the Australian people that we need this government to come out with some direct policies to address the fiscal deterioration in our nation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  It is a very sad day in this parliament when the man who would be the Treasurer of this country has 20 minutes to address the serious economic circumstances that we face in this country and spends that time lamenting nothing more than the fact that, were he Treasurer, he would have nothing left to privatise. He spent the rest of the time ridiculing the economy and the country with which, were he Treasurer, he would be out there attempting to strike a trade and economic relationship. The people in my electorate would be very sad indeed if they were to witness this debate. They would be sad but not surprised because they saw a Liberal Premier in New South Wales come to office promising not to privatise the Port Kembla harbour, but the very first thing they did when they came into office was to privatise the Port Kembla harbour, an asset worth well in excess of $100 million, and give nothing more than $10 million back to the local community. Is it any wonder that the would-be Treasurer of Australia, a member of that very same party, stands here and seriously suggests that, if he could, he would sell the National Broadband Network off for $1? In fact, he would rather give it away. This is from the man who would like to be Treasurer of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some good news in this country. It is good news for Australia but bad news for people who hate good news, such as those on the other side of the House. We are growing as an economy, and that marks us off as one of the few countries in the world that can say that. We are growing at around three per cent on trend. Indeed, our economy, the Australian economy, has pulled itself through the worst recession in the world in over 100 years and it is now 13 per cent bigger than it was in 2004. This on its own is nothing short of a miracle. But when you add on top of that the fact that over that self-same period an additional 850,000 new jobs have been created it is no wonder that when people get off the plane at Mascot airport they ask, 'What are you guys doing in Australia? We've come here to learn because you guys must be doing something right and we envy your economy. We envy the economic circumstances that you have here in Australia.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was tempted to describe the economics proffered by those on the other side as 'bonehead economics' or 'Flintstone economics', but that would be wrong because bones have weight. There has been absolutely no weight and no substance to the contribution that has been given by each of the three speakers in this debate so far. They would have you believe that the only right thing for a government to do is sit here and deliver a surplus, year in and year out, no matter what the economic circumstances are. It does not take a year 7 economics student to work out that if your economic recipe for this country is to deliver a surplus no matter what the economic circumstances are, if your promise to the Australian people is that you will deliver a surplus year in and year out no matter the economic circumstances, your promise to the Australian people is twofold. Firstly, you are promising to tax them more than you need to because, if you are a government that consistently collects more revenue than you are spending, you are a government that is consistently taxing the Australian people more than you need to. Is that the sort of economic recipe that they would have for this great country of ours? The second thing they are promising is to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. If as a government you are proposing to deliver a surplus no matter what the economic circumstances are, you are promising to do precisely the wrong things at the wrong time in the economic cycle while taxing the Australian people more than you need to. It is little wonder that we hear that from those on the other side and the man who would be Treasurer of this country because they wear the gold medal for the highest taxing government in this country’s history, at 24.2 per cent of GDP in 2004-05. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have spoken for well over 40 minutes in contributing to this debate. Is it any wonder that the one report they did not mention is a recent report from the International Monetary Fund which has belled the cat? It has said that the Howard government was the most profligate, the highest spending government, in the nation’s history. It was the most reckless-spending government in this nation’s history. When the economy was raining gold bars, what that government should have been doing was addressing some of the long-term problems, the long-term issues, that we have in this country. As members from the National Party would often lament, it should have been spending more on infrastructure, more on roads. It is a source of great embarrassment to those in the National Party that this government has spent more on roads and more on rail—more on critical infrastructure—than the coalition ever did when it was in government. That is a source of great embarrassment to every single National Party member who sits on the other side of the House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you reject bonehead economics such as those offered by the other side and you are committed to doing the right thing, then you ensure, at the time in the economic cycle when the government needs to act to support jobs and growth, that you stimulate the economy. If that means going into deficit, then that is the right thing to do. As the economy starts to recover, you start to pull back on spending—and that, indeed, is exactly what this government has done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are looking at stimulating, with targeted expenditure, those areas of the economy that need assistance but pulling back on some of those longer term spendings and expenditures which are going to create structural problems over the long term. That is why we have delivered $130 billion worth of structural savings to the budget—indeed, over $16 billion since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. That is the right thing to do. You will not hear that from the economic lightweights on the other side. All they can do is crack jokes about how much they would like to privatise the assets of this country, or denigrate our great trading partners, the people they would like to strike up an economic relationship with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, you will hear a lot of whinging from those on the other side about government spending. But when they go back to their electorates they are talking about the projects they wish the government would fund. The longest line in my electorate is that of Liberal Party councillors and Liberal Party supporters who are knocking on my door saying, 'Whatever you do, you've got to stop that Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, from tearing up the NBN; and for God’s sake can you ensure that it turns up to my business, to my house, to my school before that bloke ever sits on this side of the House.' The longest line in any electorate office will be the line of Liberal Party people who are pro the NBN—people who want to see the NBN rolled out in their neighbourhood, to their business, to their school, to their university. They will not be talking about these sorts of things in their electorate, but when they come here to Canberra these are exactly the sorts of things that they are saying the government should be doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken about spending on infrastructure. Is it the investments such as we are proposing to create a revolution in our school education system that they want us to axe? Is it the funds we have set aside for regional development in this country that they want us to axe? I heard the previous speaker say that the minerals resource rent tax has delivered only $125 million in the last six months. That is $125 million more than it would have collected if those opposite were in office, and I can tell you it would go a long way to delivering much needed infrastructure projects in my electorate. The tax is actually working in exactly the right way. It collects more revenue as company profits increase and less revenue when they do not. These are the sorts of things that a government will do if it is not wedded to the sort of bonehead economics of those on the other side of the House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about taxation and we are talking about revenue and expenditure. As we go into the next election those on the other side of the House will go to their electorates promising tax cuts for the wealthiest, tax increases for the poorest and pension cuts for people who can least afford it. This is the sort of bonehead economics that they are so wedded to. They do not look beneath the talking points. They are following the empty slogans of their leaders. But the facts do not lie: low unemployment, trend growth, an economy which is the envy of the rest of the world and public finances in good shape, as every respected commentator will testify. These are the sorts of things we should be doing if we are serious about economics in this country. </span>

                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  We have just listened to a wonderful 10-minute contribution from the member for Throsby on vapourware and Keynesian economics, which are well and truly discredited in this day and age. Again we stand here discussing the government's inability to manage its own budget circumstances. Maybe we should clear up a couple of misconceptions at the outset. If you take the amount of debt that this government has added to the Australian people's credit cards over the past five years as a percentage of spending on GDP, it is well in excess of anything the Howard government ever spent during its term. I love the fact that those opposite say they have had budget savings over the past five years. The Australian people, including those in the gallery, should know that they include in that 27 new or increased taxes which they are saying are savings. The last time I checked, increasing taxes was not a saving. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand here today debating this MPI because this government has a serious and undeniable spending crisis. We are faced with a government that over the past five years has succeeded in destroying a fiscal foundation that took 10 years to create. This fiscal foundation was predicated on a sound budgetary policy of surpluses—surpluses which paid off $96 billion of debt and surpluses which allowed us to put funds away to save for the future and for future generations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This prudent fiscal management resulted in the creation of not only the Future Fund but also the Higher Education Endowment Fund, with an initial investment of some $5 billion, and the Health and Medical Infrastructure Fund, with an initial investment of some $2½ billion. The objective of these funds was to utilise the earnings to fund capacity improvements in higher education and health and medical infrastructure, whilst leaving the capital to accumulate for future generations. But in 2008 the Labor government rolled these funds into the nation-building funds, and within those funds they created the opportunity to spend not only the earnings but also, crucially, the capital, which had been set aside for the longer term. Of these funds, only the Future Fund now remains intact; however, due to the government's financial profligacy, it has not had any additional funds added to it in the past five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know two things about this Labor government: they cannot manage the economy and they cannot be trusted. Businesses and households now know they cannot believe a word the government say about the budget or the state of the economy. We see the government frequently complain that their dire fiscal position is due to falling revenue, when the fact is that revenue has remained reasonably steady over the period. However, the differences occur when comparing the actual revenue received to what was forecast, and therein lies the tale of this government's fiscal and economic ineptitude. During a period with some of the best terms of trade in our history and despite the government introducing, as I said earlier, 27 new taxes and increased taxes and a whole range of fees and charges, we have seen a gross deterioration in our nation's fiscal position. This deterioration has not been due to the community's lack of effort or our business community's drive to improve their business but is directly a result of the Labor government's failure to adequately manage their finances and live within their means. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have witnessed over the past five years the greatest fiscal deterioration in our nation's history. We have seen a government that calls tax increases savings. We have seen a government that has spent some $172 billion more than it has collected in revenue over the past five years, resulting in the Australian people now owing more than a quarter of a trillion dollars. In the current budget year, 2012-13, the government has increased the debt limit to a record $300 billion. It was only some $75 billion in the 2008-09 year. Australians know that that debt needs to be serviced and repaid. Today's debt is tomorrow's taxes. More debt means more money spent in the future on interest payments instead of on schools, hospitals or lowering taxes. As the member for North Sydney quite rightly pointed out, our gross interest bill is now some $12 billion a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say today that this government has seen the light and learnt the lessons from its profligate  spending. However, sadly that appears not to be the case. An analysis by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> last year reveals that future governments will need to raise some $120 billion by the end of the decade to pay for Labor's unfunded spending commitments. The budget bottom line has already been hit by Labor's multi-billion-dollar blow-out on border protection. It will be further hit by Labor's massive unfunded commitments in disability services, defence, education and now dental care. Australians are entitled to ask, 'Where is the money coming from?' I would like to give you a list of some of the unfunded commitments: the National Disability Insurance Scheme; aged care; increases for low-paid workers in the social and community sector; offshore processing; an increase in the refugee intake; defence; the dental care scheme; and the Gonski review implementation. We all agree that education is extremely important for our children, but we need to pay for it in a sensible and considered way so that, when they enter the workforce, it is not their taxes that are paying for their education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently we have seen the Business Council of Australia make the following comments in regard to the budget, 'It is in urgent need of repair,' and 'The government’s fiscal strategy is not working and needs a major rethink.' In addition, analysis by Deloitte Access Economics shows that this Labor government has added almost $50 billion to the budget in new spending programs. This is the fundamental underlying issue for this Labor government: it does not know how to control its spending. It is interesting to note the comments made by the authors of a European Central Bank working paper on the effect of the size of government on economic performance. The results of their studies show 'a significant negative effect of the size of government on growth'. They say: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Interestingly, government consumption is consistently detrimental to output growth irrespective of the country sample considered …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, they surmise that the more resources required for financing government spending, the greater the reduction in the optimal level of private consumption as well as productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government that continue to spend like a drunken sailor. They talk about improving productivity within our economy, yet their very profligate spending policies are actually greatly detrimental to increasing our productivity and our national wealth. This is why the coalition is focused on ensuring that, if we are elected to government at the next federal election, we will live within our means, reducing the negative impact of profligate government expenditure on the Australian economy. It is important to note that the budget will always be in a stronger position under a coalition government because good economic management is in our DNA. It is only a coalition government that has the desire to restore hope, reward and opportunity to the Australian people.</span>

Most stakeholders supported the need to modernise the regulation of the sector and in doing so increase regulatory efficiency and effectiveness. However, several stakeholders also expressed their concern that some aspects of the bill would negatively impact the agvet chemicals sector. Stakeholders highlighted areas including the proposal for a preliminary assessment process and also the proposal for a system of mandatory re-registration and re-approval for agvet chemicals and products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found that the proposed preliminary assessment process has been designed to increase the quality of applications provided to the APVMA. The committee acknowledges the concerns that this process may create some costs for applicants for re-registration of agvet chemical and products. However, the committee felt that overall the process would allow the APVMA to concentrate its resources on providing more timely assessments of applications and reduce delays in evaluating deficient applications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the inquiry, the committee heard that some agvet chemicals and products had been in use in Australia for well over 40 years. The committee was concerned that many of these chemicals and products had not been tested against contemporary standards for human, animal and plant health and safety. This underscores the importance of modernising the agvet regulation scheme, and the need for regular but balanced requirements for re-registration and re-approval based on the risk profiles of each chemical or product. Australia needs to have a robust, systematic and efficient system of agvet chemical and product regulation. This is important not only domestically, but also to ensure Australia retains its international competitiveness in the agvet sector.</span>

I am also extremely grateful of the time and effort spent by industry and environmental stakeholders who participated in the inquiry. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  by leave—I rise to give a perspective from the coalition members of this committee. Those members were: Mr Alby Schultz, the member for Hume; Mr Rowan Ramsey, the member for Grey, who is here beside me; Mr George Christensen, the member for Dawson, and me. We issued a dissenting report and I would like to briefly summarise why. As we saw it, the bill as drafted provides a substantial increase in regulatory burden and costs that will have a negative impact on the industry without significantly improving the efficiency of regulation and the re-registration process will slow down, rather than increase, the review of suspect chemicals. Of particular note, we were extremely concerned that there was not a proper cost benefit analysis done on the financial impact that this could have on the industry. We would call on the government to do this cost benefit analysis properly so that we have a real idea of the impact and red tape burden that this will have on industry. We have two recommendations, which we have put in our dissenting report: remove the re-registration process from the bill and set up a troika taskforce of industry, the department and the APVMA to urgently evaluate and improve the internal systems of the APVMA to increase its efficiency, effectiveness and the speed of review of at risk chemicals.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In referring the bill, the Selection Committee wished the Electoral Matters Committee to further scrutinise its amendments and ensure consideration was given to any unintended consequences. During the committee's inquiry, issues arose regarding the exclusion of ballots, the new prepoll voting arrangements and the ability of the Australian Electoral Commission to use taxpayer information to update the electoral roll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides that prematurely opened ballots must be excluded from the count. At the 2010 federal election, ballot boxes were opened prematurely due to an official error in two prepoll voting centres. Due to the legislative ambiguity regarding the appropriate response to these breaches, the Australian Electoral Commission sought legal advice. The advice was that it would be prudent for these ballots to be excluded. The commission subsequently recommended to the committee that the appropriate action be clarified in the Electoral Act and that votes should be reinstated if the incident proved to be an official error.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does not contain a vote savings provision and the committee did not support one in its 2010 federal election report. Having carefully considered the evidence in this inquiry, however, the committee took the view that votes should be reinstated if a ballot box is handled unlawfully by any person but no tampering of ballot papers has occurred. The committee's view is that this balances voter enfranchisement and electoral integrity. The committee recommends that the vote savings procedures proposed to this inquiry by the Electoral Commission be incorporated in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge that Mrs Bishop, who is at the table, was the one who pursued this in the public hearings. The committee were unanimous in the view that we should support the approach she proposed in relation to that matter. I think it needs to be acknowledged that, but for the member at the table's persistence in this matter at the public hearings, the committee may well have maintained its earlier view. This issue is about enfranchisement and the member is to be commended for her pursuit of this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard also that the Electoral Act lacks clarity on whether the penalties faced by an electoral official who deliberately and unlawfully interferes with a ballot box or ballot papers are the same as the penalties facing a member of the public for this offence. The committee recommends that the bill be amended to clarify this in the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The removal of the requirement for a prepoll ordinary voter to complete a certificate will provide efficiencies in polling place management and align the Commonwealth with a number of state and territory jurisdictions. Moving the commencement of prepoll voting back by one day will allow sufficient time to print the many millions of ballot papers required for a federal election. Moving the deadline for postal vote applications forward by one day will reduce the chance that postal votes will be received too late. Increasing the fixed periods of time to inquire into further objections to a proposed electoral boundary redistribution will provide the Electoral Commission with valuable additional time to conduct these inquiries. Allowing the Electoral Commission to use certain taxpayer information to update the roll of electors is a logical extension of existing continuous roll update processes and direct enrolment using third party information. The committee is satisfied that this will not undermine roll integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions of the bill were recommended in the 2010 federal election report of the committee and continue to be supported by the committee.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I thank the organisations and individuals who assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions or participating at the public hearing in Canberra. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their work and contribution to this report and the secretariat for their work on this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">):</span>  by leave—There were serious differences between the government and opposition on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Administration) Bill 2012 referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. These differences are ongoing. They relate to the protection of the integrity of the roll. In many of the dissenting reports we have written since the government introduced automatic enrolment, we have made the point—and we continue to make the point—that we believe it destroys the integrity of the roll. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We object to the proposed changes which allow the Australian Taxation Office to give material to the Electoral Commission not only because they put at risk the integrity of the roll—it is utilising material which has been developed for another purpose and the accuracy of which cannot be vouched for—but because people's individual details in tax office material have always been regarded as sacrosanct. There have always been serious penalties for anyone in the tax office who divulges such information. The proposed changes to the act will in fact remove penalties for any officers involved in such behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the proposed changes to the Taxation Administration Act, we point out in our dissenting report, as we do quite often, that a 1999 report by the House of Representatives Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, <span style="font-style:italic;">Numbers </span><span style="font-style:italic;">on the run: r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview of the ANAO audit report No.37 1998-99 on the management of tax file numbers</span>, found that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than there were people in Australia at the then most recent census, that there are potentially 185,000 duplicate tax records for individuals and that 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in the sample match. It was again pointed out in evidence given at the public hearings initially, dealing with automatic enrolment, that a single roll that may be given to the Electoral Commission is in fact a composite of a lot of other sources, all of which are not checked either. If we look at another example of inaccuracy of government-held information, in this case the integrity of the Medicare enrolment data, the ANAO audit report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ANAO found that up to half a million active Medicare enrolment records were probably for people who are deceased.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cite those examples just to show that the integrity of the roll is very much at risk. When the bill comes up for debate we will be able to deal with these matters in more detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also think it is still necessary for someone who is exercising a prepoll vote to sign a certificate. We are against the concept of an election period which equates election day with a period of up to 19 days if the amendments go through, and we feel that that is bad on two counts: 19 days is too long—it should be restricted to 12—and also to not have a requirement to sign a declaration as to how you are complying with the act in seeking a prepoll vote is again to denigrate election day in favour of an election period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We then came to the opening of a ballot box prior to the closing of the poll on election day. I will deal with this more in my speech in the second reading debate on the bill itself, but there were enormous concerns shared by the committee as a whole—and I am grateful to the chairman of the committee for acknowledging that I did pursue the matter vociferously. To me it is unconscionable that votes which people have cast in good faith can be excluded from scrutiny because a box has been opened prematurely. We needed to have a saving clause, and I am very grateful that we reached agreement on many of those principles—where we disagreed was on the question of account. I will deal with that in the second reading debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At all times there has been a profound disagreement between the government and the opposition about the integrity of the roll. I cite very often the legal precedents which say that you cannot go behind the roll—once the roll is established, you may not challenge who has gone onto it. Therefore, you have to be able to vouch for the integrity of who goes onto it—and it seems to me, in a land where we value the right to vote, that the requirement that you as an individual when you reach 18 or become a citizen to fill out a form to become a citizen enrolled to vote is not very onerous. I think that philosophical divide will continue and, should we be successful in being elected at the next election, it is certainly a matter we will address.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms OWENS:</span>
                    </a> by leave—The Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013 makes a number of amendments to the tax law. Schedule 1 amends part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 with the aim of ensuring that the act continues to counter schemes that comply with the technical requirements of the tax law but which, when viewed objectively, are conducted in a particular way mainly to avoid tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill aims to modernise Australia's transfer pricing rules and provide a new, comprehensive and robust transfer pricing regime that is aligned with internationally accepted principles. The objective of these new transfer pricing rules is to ensure that an appropriate return for the contribution of Australian operations of a multinational group is taxable in Australia for the benefit of the broader community. Both schedules were the subject of prior public consultation by the Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 March 2012, the government announced that it would introduce amendments to ensure part IVA continued to be effective in countering tax avoidance schemes. The government's announcement was made after reviewing a number of judicial decisions. The government was concerned that some taxpayers had argued successfully that they did not get a tax benefit because, absent the scheme, they would not have entered into an arrangement that attracted tax, because they would have entered into a different scheme that also avoided tax, or because they would have deferred their arrangements indefinitely, or because they would have done nothing at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 amends part IVA to address weaknesses that have come to light as a result of judicial decisions in determining whether there is a tax benefit in connection with a scheme and what that tax benefit is. Schedule 1 provides that the Commissioner of Taxation may use either of two alternative approaches to cancel a tax benefit obtained by a taxpayer in connection with a scheme that was entered into for the sole or dominant purpose, objectively ascertained, of avoiding tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These alternative postulates are an annihilation approach, whereby the scheme must be assumed not to have happened but all other events that actually happened must be incorporated; and a reconstruction approach, which must represent a reasonable alternative to the scheme but disregard any potential tax costs. The result of either of these postulates will be that the tax effect is less advantageous to the relevant taxpayer than that secured by the taxpayer in connection with the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was claimed in some of the submissions that the amendments in schedule 1 are unnecessary as the court decisions are reasonably unique and of limited application. There are further claims in some submissions that it is not clear how the alternative postulates will operate. However, it is the committee's view that the amendments in the bill are a measured response to exposed weaknesses in the operation of the tax benefit concept.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury emphasised in its submission to the committee that the annihilation and reconstruction approaches are clearly intended to operate as alternative bases for identifying tax benefits and will not lead to more income tax being payable than results from the ordinary operation of the tax law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill is vital to modernise Australia's transfer pricing rules and bring these into line with accepted international arm's length principles recommended by the OECD. Transfer pricing refers to the prices at which an enterprise transfers physical goods and intangible property or provides services to associated enterprises in different tax jurisdictions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arm's length principle is the international standard that OECD member countries have agreed should be used for determining transfer prices for tax purposes. This principle is that each enterprise within a multinational enterprise should be treated as a separate entity and it should be determined what independent entities would have done in the place of the parties. This provides a broad parity of tax treatment for members of multinational groups and independent enterprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee notes claims in some of the submissions it received that the bill is not consistent with OECD transfer pricing guidelines and that schedule 2 goes beyond the exceptional circumstances specified by these guidelines for a tax administration to disregard the structure adopted by a taxpayer for a controlled transaction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also proposed in several submissions that the seven-year limit for a transfer pricing adjustment to be made by the Commissioner of Taxation is too long and should be four years only, as applies to general income tax assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However the application and effect of the proposed reconstruction rules are clearly based on the language used in the OECD guidelines and the bill also contains a guidance provision that requires the relevant rules to be interpreted consistently with these guidelines. The Treasury also asserts that a four-year limit to conduct transfer pricing adjustments would not provide the commissioner with adequate time to conduct transfer pricing audits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the OECD transfer pricing guidelines are currently the 'best thinking evident in transfer pricing'. The committee considers that reconstruction powers in exceptional circumstances are a core part of modern transfer pricing regimes and that the bill implements these powers consistently with the OECD guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the bill will enable the Commissioner of Taxation to objectively and reasonably enforce tax avoidance measures and collect revenue to which the Commonwealth is entitled under the law, and the bill should pass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I thank the organisations that assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the report, and I thank the secretariat, who have worked in what is a very complex area of tax law. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  by leave—I am pleased, on behalf of the coalition, to raise some of the objections put forward in the dissenting report by coalition members with respect to this so-called inquiry—predominantly because there was no inquiry. The Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013 was a bill which was referred for inquiry to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics for which there was no inquiry. Liberal members were particularly concerned because it did not provide us with an opportunity to test the information that was provided—to test, not only in terms of public opinion but also with a number of key and specialist stakeholders, a number of the assertions that were made by various parties and of course by the government in relation to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to questions about the financial impact of this bill and specifically how schedule 1 applies to part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the explanatory memorandum to the bill states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments are expected to prevent the loss of over $1 billion a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the reality is that there was very little detail provided as to how this amount had been quantified. Also, it would have been prudent to confirm whether there was any financial impact from the changes put forward in schedule 2 of the bill, relating to the modernisation of transfer pricing rules, despite the fact that the explanatory memorandum stated that the impact would be nil. On those two principal bases alone, we as coalition members of the Standing Committee on Economics have sincere and grave concerns that we did not have the opportunity to inquire into this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, with respect to schedule 1, coalition members have legitimate concerns that the drafting of this schedule may once again be an overreaction by this Labor government with respect to the operation of part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There have been a number of instances over the past several years with respect to part IVA where the Commissioner of Taxation has lost high-profile court cases, and there is a real risk, frankly, that the government, via these amendments, is overreacting and giving the commissioner too much power to raise tax and penalties in the context of alleged income tax avoidance. I note that this is a view that seems to be held and shared by, among others, the Tax Institute, the Corporate Tax Association and the Law Council of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to schedule 2, the modernisation of transfer pricing, the reality is that Australia's transfer pricing regime has stood the test of time. But the committee, as a consequence of not holding hearings, was unable to look at whether or not the new proposals that have been put forward, the amendments encapsulated by this bill, will in fact achieve the same longevity as the previous framework did—and, again, we do not know whether or not this has the full support of stakeholders. For example, many submissions, including from the Corporate Tax Association, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and the Tax Institute, all shared our concern about ensuring that it was robust and workable and will stand the test of time. But, as I said, without the opportunity for a public inquiry, we do not know whether or not that is the case. I note that the TI—that is, the Tax Institute—said on page 7 of their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we are concerned that the Bill as currently drafted will not yield many of the lauded simplicity and certainty benefits and will increase the compliance burden especially and disproportionately on small to medium enterprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that is something that resonates with coalition members, because this side of the chamber understands small business; this side of the chamber has a background of small business. And, frankly, it stands in stark contrast to, firstly, the government's lack of understanding on small business and, secondly, the sometimes hollow safeguards or guarantees the government put forward with respect to the application and consequences of bills that are introduced. So, for those reasons that I have outlined, we dissented from the main report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the committee secretariat for their assistance to the government members and to some extent, albeit minor, to the coalition members! But it has ever been thus and, I suspect, always will be thus. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to speak.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  In speaking to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Administration) Bill 2012 I will be drawing on the dissenting report which the opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters wrote and which was tabled in this House only some minutes ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I begin by saying that this administration bill contains two provisions on which there is agreement between the government and the opposition. The first is that which brings forward the deadline for applications for postal votes by one day—that is, from the Thursday before polling day to the Wednesday before polling day. We think that this is a sensible move because, as the legislation currently stands, people who get their postal vote application in at the last minute are very likely not to be successful in having it in in time. We think that the Wednesday is a more realistic deadline. The second is the provision which provides for further fixed periods of time to be provided to the augmented Electoral Commission, as defined in section 70 of the Electoral Act, to complete its inquiries into objections against proposed redistributions in electoral boundaries. Basically the new provision deals with the situation where a redistribution is on foot when an election is called, and this part of the act, as it stands, certainly needs to be tidied up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said earlier in making remarks on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the integrity of the roll, on the one hand, and the wish to put as many people on it as possible, on the other hand—which is the government's desire—constitutes a great gulf between the government and the opposition. Unfortunately, the Australian Electoral Commission also seems to be dead keen on just sticking people on the roll willy-nilly without having to honour the Electoral Act in its current form—that is, to require people, when they turn 18 or become citizens, to fill out a form and become an enrolled voter. We think that in this country, where we have compulsory registration, it is not onerous to ask somebody to value their vote sufficiently to go to the correct place and fill out a form so there is a record of their signature which can be checked if necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have long been debates in this place about electoral fraud, and I have no doubt in my mind, having looked at the facts, that it exists. But it has never been pursued. With the coming of technology, however, we ought to be looking at being able to link the rolls in the polling places for each electorate so that, when somebody's name is marked off on one roll, it can be automatically marked off on all the others. I understand that this practice has been trialled in Victoria and worked very successfully, and I am sure that it is not beyond the wit of the Australian Electoral Commission to bring it into operation federally. Doing so could get rid of the difficulty we have with multiple voting, which was done in the last election by, I think, some 18,000 people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the day on which the integrity of the rolls is opened up through automatic enrolment will be a very sad day for our system of voting. I said in my earlier speech that the accuracy of government data which is held is very suspect. I cited the number of tax file numbers that were found in 1999, the last time there was a review of tax file numbers. There were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than there were people in Australia at the census prior; there were 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals; and 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in the sample match. It was pointed out to us in the committee, when we took evidence on the concept of automatic enrolment, that, for instance, a Centrelink roll, which the AEC now uses, is in fact a composite of anything up to 100 other lists that are brought together, that there is no check-in and that the AEC has no ability to check.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we support the idea of now introducing legislation which will authorise the tax office to give material, the giving of which by a tax official to any other agency or person was previously proscribed an offence, to the Australian Electoral Commission. This legislation will remove the penalty from the Taxation Administration Act in order that the material may be given to the Electoral Commission by a tax officer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We feel very strongly about the legal decisions that have already been brought down when there have been challenges to election outcomes—and very often less than 1,000 votes can determine whether a seat is won or lost—and about returning to the roll its integrity, and people's confidence in it, by having people go themselves to become an enrolled voter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will also do away with the need to have a certificate signed by a person wishing to exercise a prepoll vote. I hear creeping into the language, both from the Electoral Commission and from others, expressions of the idea that we have an election period. We do not; we have an election day. We have many regulations that say when you can have electronic advertisements—up to what date and so on—and speeches formally launching their campaigns are, for a variety of reasons, given by the leaders ever closer to election day. But a whole host of people can be voting before the speeches are made and before the manifestos, if you like, of the parties are put. This means that people who vote before election day are not given all the information which is given to people who are voting on election day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we feel so strongly about the maintenance of our system of postal votes and of allowing political parties to be part of that process so that they can send out information informing postal voters of what the political parties' attitudes are. We feel that they need to be placed in a similar position to that of someone who is voting on election day and who is able to hear all the arguments and look at all the printed material prior to casting a vote. So we feel that this lessening of the deterrent that exists for people to turn up on election day—where anybody can just turn up to a prepoll because it is easier; they cannot be bothered on election day; or whatever it is—is not in the interests of someone who is considering the vote that they cast on election day. I can see, however, that it is going to be quite important for prepoll if we are to have an election on 14 September, as that will be Yom Kippur for Jewish members of the Australian population, and they feel very sensitive about the way in which that date has been set with no consideration for their very important religious day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We oppose doing away with the certificate that is presently needed, even though we acknowledge that the nature and character of a prepoll vote has been changed from being a declaration vote to an ordinary vote. This in itself has led to the great difficulty that was encountered in the last election, when the opening of ballot boxes containing prepoll votes prior to the close of the poll at 6 pm on election day became an improper practice when previously it had been a quite proper practice. The reason is that just before the 2010 election the government changed the law so that a prepoll vote, which was previously a declaration vote and therefore could be opened prior to 6 pm on election day, became an ordinary vote so that it would be counted on election night and we would get a quicker outcome. But the problem was that adequate information was not given to all of the electoral offices right across the country, and so they did not know that the change had been made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had two instances, one in Boothby and one in the seat of Flynn, where it was picked up scrutineers that the ballots looked orderly, particularly in Boothby, when they should have all been crumpled up and looking a bit disorderly, as they are in an ordinary ballot box. Consequently, the Electoral Commission was tasked with the difficulty of making a decision as to what happened to those ballot papers. They did seek advice from the Australian Government Solicitor, who knew how many votes were involved. They knew that in neither the case of Boothby nor the case of Flynn would excluding those ballot papers from the scrutiny make any difference to the outcome of the declaration of those two seats. But we on the committee did request—and I do acknowledge that the chairman was strong in backing up my request—that the legal opinion which the AEC had sought be made public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite unusual for government advice from the AEC to be made public, but it was very important in properly considering the question of the AEC's recommendation that, where there was an opening of a ballot box other than in conformity with the act prior to the close of the poll, all those votes should be simply excluded from the scrutiny. It seemed to me to be an appalling proposition because these were people who had cast a vote in good faith and, through no fault of theirs, their vote was to be made informal; their vote was not to be counted. Voter entitlement and voters being confident that their vote, properly cast, would be counted are a very important principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Government Solicitor gave some extraordinary advice. It said: 'In the present circumstances, we consider that the better course of action is not to include the ballot papers in the count and to quarantine those papers, although, for the reasons we discuss below, it is possible that a court might take a different view.' In the case of Mitchell and Bailey, which involved the seat of McEwen, the Federal Court held that a ballot paper must be included in the count if it was a formal vote. It said: 'If a ballot paper is not informal, the officer conducting the scrutiny will have no legal basis for rejecting it. An implied obligation to admit such a ballot paper to the count thereby arises. Once it is admitted, it must be counted.' The advice went on to try and distinguish that case as not being relevant in a way that I do not think is in any way convincing. I found that the subsequent recommendation of the AEC that those votes should be just simply excluded from the scrutiny was a very—dare I use the word—sloppy way of dealing with the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did take evidence from others who shared our view. The result is that the report recommends that there should be saving provisions. Having done that, the chair went back to the AEC and the AEC came back with another set of saving provisions which it thought might be adequate for the purpose. As I said, the main question that remains between the government and the opposition is that of when the count is conducted. If the votes are not counted on the night and are simply parcelled, sealed and sent off to the DRO and then somebody else does a count, you are going to have a problem with the tally on the night, but, more importantly, it enshrines the principle that citizens have the right to have their vote counted where the error is not theirs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also very important that we maintain the identification of those ballot papers which are at risk. The reason that we are talking about both ballot papers and envelopes is that the box concerned can have a mixture of ballot papers and envelopes—now all ordinary votes but categorised differently in the mode in which they go into the ballot box. I think this question is an important one because it brings out another question which is yet to be dealt with and for which there is no provision in the act at this stage. The first count of the night is put into plastic bags, not boxes, and sealed up. If someone tampers with those, there is still no provision in the act for what happens to those, so that remains a problem for another day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of the proposal to allow prepoll to occur up to 19 days prior to election day, we on the opposition side have recommended that it should be no greater than 12. It is up to 19 because of the leeway that exists for when the close of nominations takes place. We are concerned that, again, it is lessening the importance of election day. Every day by which prepoll is longer means that the importance of election day itself becomes lesser. Although we can see the need for having a prepoll, and indeed we are very supportive and have always been supportive of it, we do think that restrictions on it need to be put in place. We think that the amendment that would allow up to 19 days is sending the wrong message, and we feel it should not be allowed to stand unchallenged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the question of the opening of the box containing the prepoll ballots. In the review that was done by a former Electoral Commissioner, he made it quite clear that there was not sufficient information given to electoral staff. The fact that it was picked up in only two divisions I think was really good luck rather than good management. To my way of thinking, it is true to say that that same error could have occurred all over the country, and we just did not know about it because there was no scrutineer or other official there who picked it up at the time. The provision that is going to be put into the act will, I hope, state that you have to be careful to comply with the law as it stands and that there is an obligation on the AEC to make sure that all of its people who are in charge of the various stages of elections are properly informed and have all the information. Otherwise, it could happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another curious thing in the act says that if a box is prematurely opened by an official then their penalty for so doing is less than that for an ordinary punter who also prematurely opens a ballot box. We have recommended that that be the same penalty for both. It is a fairly serious penalty. It can be six months in jail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are bits of the Electoral Act where there are serious messages sent out that getting anything wrong with the handling of an election incurs a serious penalty. Yet, at so many turns, we now seem to be loosening the requirements, which makes it easier for what we might say are inappropriate things to happen in the election process, all in the name of it being allegedly simpler to administer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition feels very strongly about all the amendments that are being brought in by the government, whether it is initially automatic enrolment, automatic so-called updates or changes of address, or letting criminals vote. There are many things that are being done to alter what we consider to be the integrity of the process, which, should we be elected, we will certainly be addressing. I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage of the debate. I presume that, should the government accept some of the recommendations made by the report, it may be introducing some of its own amendments. Presumably it too will circulate its proposed amendments when we move to the consideration in detail stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a lot of strong language used in some of our hearings. Issues have been fiercely pursued, and I am certainly one of those who have fiercely pursued many of the issues. Because we have now had several inquiries into pieces of legislation, as well as the initial report on the 2010 election, I think there is now a greater awareness by many people, who raise the question of electoral matters with me. This simply would not have happened before we embarked on this process of having a greater scrutiny over the process of proposed changes to the Electoral Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to say that, when we make changes to the act, there is a huge obligation on the Australian Electoral Commission to make sure that their operatives—the people who are carrying out duties pursuant to the act—are well-informed and that they are carrying out the changes that are made by the parliament in a way which the parliament intended. Perhaps I will just mention one place where that clearly did not occur, which was after the government of the day, the Howard government, had put in place provisions for having oversight—I will use to the word 'audit' in its looser sense—of associated entities and how not one trade union was in the sights of or audited in that way by the Australian Electoral Commission. When we asked the question about why, the answer was given that: 'We were not given any extra resources and we thought Fair Work Australia could carry out some of that duty.' That is not so; if it is in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, it is the Australian Electoral Commission's responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very serious business. It is a very serious act. It has very strong provisions in it, even though some of them have now been lessened over time—presumably to make it easier for it to be administered. I will just repeat that the opposition, should it be in government, will take a totally different attitude to maintaining the integrity of the roll and to ensuring that citizens who have obligations in fact meet those obligations.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MELHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I rise to support the bill before the House. It is a bill which arose out of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into the 2010 federal election. A number of recommendations were made. In particular, this bill implements the government's response to recommendations three, nine, 10, 11, 15, 29 and 30 of the report. I note that recommendations 15 and 29 were unanimous recommendations of the committee. I did table earlier today a copy of the advisory report on this bill to the House. I think it is important to acknowledge—as I did in tabling that report—the role played by the member for Mackellar in the public hearings, because she quite actively pursued a particular angle which changed the views of the committee. I think the views of the committee swung around unanimously to those of the member for Mackellar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the committee's report has made two recommendations to the government to make changes to the bill. I will read them: On page 30, it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…a vote savings measure to the procedures to be followed if ballot boxes are opened prematurely. This vote savings measure should incorporate the elements proposed by the AEC to this inquiry and provide that ballot papers that have not been tampered with in any way must be reinstated to the count but otherwise excluded. This savings measure should apply at any stage of the scrutiny to a ballot box that has been unlawfully handled by any person…</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, as the member for Mackellar pointed out, we recommended an amendment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…explicitly stipulating that any electoral official who deliberately and unlawfully interferes with a ballot box or ballot papers be subject to the same penalty as any other person who commits this offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current bill contains the earlier recommendations of the committee, which were based on submissions. But I understand that there will be some government amendments, which have been given to me as chair of the committee and, as I understand it, have been given to the shadow minister—the member for Mackellar. They will pick up the committee's unanimous recommendations in the advisory report. The important thing is that, until the member for Mackellar pursued it, the votes would have been not included in the count. I have great confidence in the Electoral Commission—I always have had. That is not to say I have a blind confidence in them. I think the robust interaction over the years between members of the committee and the commissioner has proved very worthwhile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that the member for Mackellar pointed out in her second reading speech was that I supported her, and the committee supported her, on tabling the government's legal advice in relation to this area of votes that were excluded as a result of possible tampering or whatever. The Electoral Commission did produce the advice. That is appendix D of the report that we tabled. It is important to read parts of that advice and to see that what the Electoral Commission did was faithfully follow the legal advice that it was provided. Of that, there can be no doubt. This was advice to them of 30 August 2010. This was advice from Bridget Gilmour-Walsh, senior general counsel. But at paragraph 15, it also says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Peter Lahy, Deputy General Counsel, has read and agrees with this advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The summary of the advice is also worth quoting, which is on page 70 of our report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the present circumstances, we consider that the better course of action is not to include the ballot papers in the count and to quarantine those papers (although for the reasons we discuss below, it is possible that a court might take a different view)…</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… If the discarded votes could affect the outcome of the election, we think it would be appropriate for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to file a petition disputing the election in the court of disputed returns as permitted by s 357. We cannot see any other way of correcting the errors and consider that there is real doubt as to whether s 285 is available in the present circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All counsel from the Australian Government Solicitor and the commission can consider is the act as it currently stands. The report says later on—and this is independent of the Electoral Commission and it actually verifies this independently to us as members of parliament—that the commission was faithfully following the legal advice that is was given. And they do seek to distinguish the matter of Mitchell v Bailey, which was in relation to formal ballot papers and challenges to the formality of ballot papers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened at the last election, in two divisions, was the premature opening of postal votes. The committee is at one with the member for Mackellar that, unless tampering can be shown, those votes should go in. There is a slight difference between the member for Mackellar, me and others in relation to whether these votes should actually be counted. The only votes that we say should be counted are those that are included in the count. The others should be parcelled up, separate and identified, but they should not be included in the count unless the Court of Disputed Returns or the Australian Electoral Office rules otherwise. And, even if the Australian Electoral Office rules they are inadmissible, those votes are protected and the secrecy of those votes is paramount. The argument, and general electoral practice, is that, if you are not disputing the informality but you have got ballot papers inside postal vote applications and things like that, their secrecy is preserved unless they are ordered in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is worth putting into the debate that the proposed section that will deal with this is that the AEO must decide that a ballot paper is to be included in the scrutiny under part 18 unless the AEO is satisfied that the ballot paper has been fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the voter's intention. I think that adequately picks up the concern of the member for Mackellar and the concerns of the whole of the committee. What it would mean is that, if there is inadvertent error, the votes go in unless you can show that they have been tampered with or altered. I think that is a vast improvement. What it shows is that, despite the fact that we do not agree on other aspects, when it comes to enfranchisement and a whole range of other things, the committee have managed to reach agreement on other aspects of this legislation and in our report and in previous reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the differences we have are philosophical differences. For the life of me, I was gobsmacked when the member for Mackellar said we should have prepoll polling for only 12 days, not 19 days. Prepoll voting is overtaking postal voting as a preferred method of voting for those people who are not around on election day. It is like expanding the vote of the day to a longer period to allow more people to utilise it. Seven fewer days could result in a lot fewer people having the vote. As I said, it is like an election day exercise except that it is not on election day. I cannot understand this obsession of the member for Mackellar and some others with having that much less prepoll voting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations that we made and that the government has endorsed off the back of some submissions from the commission to do with not having prepoll voting before four days and one less day on postal voting are to allow a better process for the election situation. In other words, instead of having handwritten ballot papers because someone rolls up a day or two after nominations close, the Electoral Office will be able to circulate the ballot papers for all of the electorates, for all the subdivisions and particular places, over the weekend, amongst other things. There will not be an argument towards the end of the situation—and I can tell you that a lot of postal vote applications come in after the event and they are lost in the process. By tightening those timetables a better processing situation occurs and there is more urgency from the political parties, the Electoral Office and a whole range of other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I really want to counter—and again I am really gobsmacked—is the obsession with not allowing information to be passed from the tax office to the Australian Electoral Office. I refer members to page 38 of the report, which details in its conclusions what this is all about. It is about maintaining the integrity of rolls—checking information and comparing information. When you listen to the member for Mackellar and those opposite who rail against this position, you would think that the ATO does not share any of its information with anyone, that it is sacrosanct and 'don't go there'. Let me read from the report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2.73 The committee maintains the view it expressed in its 2010 federal election report that the ATO should be permitted to provide relevant data to the AEC for the purposes of facilitating enrolment. This is a logical extension of existing continuous roll update processes and direct enrolment using third party information which the committee has supported in previous bill inquiries. In addition, these proposed amendments have been discussed and agreed with the ATO and the Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2.74 The Electoral Commissioner outlined to the committee that a number of government agencies have access to data from the ATO and provided examples. The list of government entities that can receive protected information from taxation officers for specific purposes (defined in Section 355 of the Taxation Administration Act) includes, but is not limited to:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is something I assert very, very strongly: we want integrity in the electoral roll and we have integrity in the electoral roll. And when you turn around and talk about multiple votes, I would say that I have been on this parliamentary committee on and off for the 23 years I have been in the parliament, so I have heard a lot of allegations. I have heard about multiple votes. Each time we looked at multiple votes—indeed, the last two times—we heard that about 80 per cent of them were elderly people, a lot of them in nursing homes, who had voted when the mobile polling booth had come. Their children and other relatives had gotten them postal vote applications, thinking that they had not voted. That is going to continue under whatever system you have while you have mobile polling voting occurring in aged-care institutions, and postal voting situations. So it is not directly related to the concerns that the member for Mackellar has. There have been people in the past who have been prosecuted, and they should be prosecuted if there is an attempt to manipulate. It has been a long time since—</span>

The problem has been that, in effect, the Electoral Commission has to work off the act, which we the politicians design. So you can look at these things, in a number of other instances, in a bipartisan way, in a way in which we might create creative instances. What I like about the advisory report that we tabled earlier this afternoon is that we picked up the suggestion of the member for Mackellar, as well as another suggestion. We did not just sit back and say, 'Rubber stamp this bill' or 'No changes' or whatever. So, I commend her in relation to that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the other matters we are talking about, there is an ideological divide. But, as for this obsession that the ATO should not provide any information, I just do not agree with her on that. And, as I just demonstrated, they provided in a number of other instances that the Australian Electoral Commission is going to be better served if they can access those records. I commend the bill to the House. I think it is a balanced bill. It will improve integrity on the roll.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Mackellar and indeed the member for Banks on this most important piece of legislation, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Administration) Bill 2012, because voting is at the very heart of our democracy. There can be no greater privilege in this great country of ours than to actually cast a vote in a free and democratic election process. I would urge all young people out there to make sure, once they turn 18, that they enrol so that they are able to take part in this very function which, as I said, is at the very heart of our democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to hear the member who spoke previously actually praising the member for Mackellar on the initiatives she has put forward and the changes Labor has indeed made, just this afternoon, to this particular piece of legislation, because there are elements of it that are not correct; there are elements of it that need tweaking. While there might not be many speakers on this particular piece of legislation, it is, as I said, at the very heart of our democracy, and it is a most important piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Electoral Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Administration) Bill is not the government's first attempt at changing the rules to suit itself at future elections. We know that on 30 January this year the Prime Minister called a 14 September election—and, if I might say, that day cannot come soon enough. We know changes this government is trying to make to electoral administration must always be viewed with some degree of scepticism, I daresay. This is something that the Special Minister of State has tried to implement on multiple occasions, trying to make Labor's prospects of re-election that much better, that much brighter. This attempt follows a report from the Join Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that this bill seeks to implement recommendations 3, 9, 10, 11, 15, 29 and 30 made by that particular committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we work towards reforming some elements on electoral administration in this country, and there are tenets of this bill that address that very need for clarity. It is a shame, however, that this bill also includes the adoption of recommendations that are unnecessary and that in some cases jeopardise the integrity of the Australian electoral roll—a roll that cannot be in any way, shape or form jeopardised, because, as I say, this is just too important to get wrong. It is too important to have voters not be able to vote in a particular way, or voters who do cast their vote not to have those votes counted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset it is important to note that the Liberals and the Nationals have provided a dissenting report on the recommendations of the standing committee. As such, the coalition is opposed to recommendations 3, 10 and 11, which relate to the Australian Taxation Office and the arrangements for the extension of dates for pre-poll at federal elections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I would like to outline what the government wants to achieve through the introduction of this bill. The explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill explains the bill's intention to: set the procedures which must be followed when a ballot box is prematurely opened; remove the requirement for an applicant for a pre-poll vote to complete and sign a certificate, as they are currently required to do under the Commonwealth Electoral Act and Referendum Act; change requirements that pre-polling cannot commence any earlier than four days after the date set for the declaration of nomination for election or by-election; bring forward the deadline for applications for a postal vote to the Wednesday before the date set for the election rather than the current convention of the Thursday before election day; grant further fixed periods of time to the augmented Electoral Commission to complete its inquiries; and change the Taxation Administration Act to allow the Commissioner of Taxation and other taxation officers to provide forms of taxpayer information to the Australian Electoral Commission for the purpose of administering the Commonwealth Electoral Act and Referendum Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are elements of these recommendations which the coalition agrees with and is therefore keen to see enacted, and I will highlight those in greater detail in a moment. As I have stated previously, it is important we achieve electoral reform in some of the key areas this bill sets out, and the coalition indeed supports some of the committee's recommendations. The Liberals and Nationals agree with several recommendations—namely, those relating to the committee's recommendations 9, 15, 29 and 30.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, recommendation 9 pertains to the amendments to the convention regarding cases where a ballot box has been opened prematurely. I note that the government has indicated changes to its position on this, which are in line with what the coalition was arguing for in its dissenting report to the committee. I commend the member for Mackellar for her work in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we agree with the proposed amendment, in recommendation 15, to the deadline for the receipt of postal vote applications to 6pm on the Wednesday, three days before the date set for the election. Having an additional 24 hours to process postal vote applications will further enable people who are unable to attend a polling station on the date of the election to have their application for a ballot processed in time for the date of polling. This is something the coalition supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the coalition agrees with recommendation 29, which suggests amendment to section 72 of the act and any related sections pertaining to cases where an augmented Electoral Commission has formed an opinion in which it has proposed a redistribution which is significantly different to the Redistribution Committee proposal. We agree with the recommendation that a further fixed period should be provided, during which the actions required by subsection 72(13) of the act are to be undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is also in support of recommendation 30, which would seek to amend the act so that, in cases where a further fixed period is provided during which the actions required by subsection 72(13) of the act are to be undertaken, the number of days specified in subsection 72(13) of the act also be increased by the same number provided for in the further fixed period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While electoral reform is important—indeed, vital—it is critical we use this opportunity to get it right. Recommendations 9, 15, 29 and 30 will seek to do that. In saying this, however, the coalition has significant reservations about three of the standing committee's recommendations, which we therefore cannot and do not support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the government is seeking, in recommendation 3, to remove the current restriction of the Australian Taxation Office to provide information to the Australian Electoral Commission for the purpose of automatic enrolment. Under the current Taxation Administration Act 1953 it is an offence for the Australian Taxation Office to disclose protected information, and the coalition firmly believes this convention should stand. The coalition does not believe granting the Australian Taxation Office such an ability is in the interests of maintaining people's right to privacy. Convention ought to stand on the manner in which people enrol to vote in Australia. Such a move to grant the Australian Taxation Office this ability does not have our support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, recommendation 10 of the committee is that the requirement, at section 200DH of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, for an applicant for a pre-poll vote to sign a certificate be repealed. The coalition, in its dissenting report to this committee, stipulated that the move to repeal the requirement for a pre-poll applicant to sign a certificate: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… will increase the likelihood of voter fraud and threaten the integrity of the Electoral roll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot and must not let that happen. It is not necessarily an onerous or difficult task for an applicant at pre-poll to provide a signature when casting their vote at a federal election. Surely that is not too much to ask. The coalition members of this committee have said that not only is there no fathomable reason for the requirement of a signature to be repealed but also that we have significant concerns that such a move could lead to an increase in fraudulent voting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the coalition does not support recommendation 11—that an application for a pre-poll vote cannot be made prior to the Monday 19 days before the current date set for the election. This proposal is an increase on the current 12-day convention, which the coalition believes is sufficient. The date for an election for the federal parliament is set for a reason, and that is when the Liberal and National parties think that the majority of votes ought to be cast. We need to have a polling day, not a polling period. Currently it is 12 days. The other side wants 19. We feel 12 is satisfactory. The current convention of pre-poll voting opening 12 days prior to the election gives voters who cannot attend a polling station on the date of the election a sufficient window of opportunity to cast their vote. A move to increase this by a week may well take the focus off polling day, and we believe it is unnecessary. The coalition therefore stand opposed to this recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate the importance of achieving electoral reform in some key areas, which this bill has the potential to achieve. While such reform is important, there are recommendations put to the House through this bill which are unnecessary, such as the recommendation to give the Australian Taxation Office the ability to give private details of people in order to enrol them automatically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not alone in being an example of the Labor Party trying its best to improve its standing at the next election by changing electoral processes. We know Labor could amend its policy on introducing the carbon tax we were promised would never happen under the government this Prime Minister leads. Instead, Labor seems hell-bent on introducing electoral reform to make its re-election prospects better. The member for Mackellar has informed the House before of attempts by the Labor Party and its former coalition partners, the Greens, to ensure their survival at the next election. I recall the debate on maintaining addresses and the speech the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop gave on Tuesday, 20 March last year about the Labor Party getting so desperate it tried manipulating election laws to enable prisoners to vote. The member for Mackellar highlighted in that speech the fact that the former Liberal-National coalition removed the right of prisoners to vote. The good old Labor Party, in the depths of its desperation for votes at the next election, amended that to enable people who are sentenced to prison for less than two years to vote. I share the member for Mackellar's concerns about the number of people who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to prison for less than two years having the ability to vote. While there are aspects of this bill which are worthy of support, it is essential that we take the government's attempts to reform electoral procedures with a grain of salt, with scepticism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, which seeks to implement recommendations 9, 10, 11, 15, 29 and 30 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report into the conduct of the 2010 federal election and related matters, has some good ideas for electoral reform. Unfortunately, they are cloaked in the move to implement some unnecessary changes which jeopardise the integrity of the electoral roll. It is because of this that the coalition only supports recommendations 9, 15, 29 and 30 of the joint committee's report. I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, for the privilege of speaking on this very important matter.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  I will not take too much of the House's time today because, as has been clear from earlier speakers, there is a lot that can be said but it tends to be a bit repetitive. The fact is that what we are dealing with here are basically predominantly relatively minor reforms on what is, as earlier members have said, an excellent electoral system. It is an electoral system which has served us well for many years now. It is an electoral system which is international renowned. It is an electoral system that is independent. And it is an electoral system which is organic—it has evolved when change has been required. It has taken into consideration the nature of the changing patterns of the way society organises itself, the way technology has developed and the way people wish to exercise their democratic rights on an ongoing basis. For those reasons it is not unusual for us to be here in this House once again debating amendment of the acts that are involved. But in doing so we are building on a system which is, frankly, the envy of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, because it relates to the very issue of how we achieve our arrival here and maintain our careers here, it is an area which is often subject to partisan comment—partisan comment from the coalition and, at times, from the Labor Party. I have certainly been part of that over the years. As a former shadow minister, in relation to the electoral area, I have had some impassioned debates about elements of our system, particularly with the member for Mackellar amongst others—</span>

                    </a>  And some on my own side, indeed, and it has always been in good spirit. But the good thing about it is that we are always arguing about tinkering, in a situation where overwhelmingly it is a good system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so to the tinkering that we are dealing with today. As was outlined by the previous speaker, there are a number of recommendations which came from a report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, of which I am a member, as to the conduct of the 2010 federal election. The amendments are, in my view, best categorised as being about making it easier and better for people to be able to exercise their democratic rights—easier to exercise their democratic rights with respect to enrolment, and easier to exercise their democratic rights in terms of their vote. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do sometimes find ourselves in a debate in this area around that question of ensuring we have a vibrant electoral system that gives people the opportunity to participate, versus the question of the what-ifs—what might happen in certain circumstances if people should endeavour to commit electoral fraud. I stand very firmly on the side of the debate that if there is a choice between giving someone the right to exercise their vote and not, then they should be given that right. I stand very firmly on the view that our system should be encouraging rather than discouraging participation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look to the last election, one of the things that was quite disturbing was that we had one of the highest informal voting figures since Federation—in fact, it was the second highest, with the previous occasion being, I think, in 1984 when some changes had been made to the voting system for the Senate. That led to a situation where one could vote above the line—which meant that you only had to put a one in a box above a line for senatorial voting—and unfortunately part of the advertising campaign confused people around the question of what was a legitimate vote in the lower house. So, other than that occasion, the informal vote at the last election was the highest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, in terms of the question of electoral turnout: the turnout at this last election was in fact the lowest turnout since the first election where we had compulsory voting, back in the 1920s. So during the time when we have had compulsory enrolment and compulsory voting, this was the lowest percentage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This highlights some key points around the need to ensure that our rolls are capable of being updated easily and to ensure that, in the process of doing that, you do not throw the baby out with the bathwater and you still have a system of integrity. One of the key things around the changes that are being proposed, of which elements are in this bill, is ensuring that you are able to cross-reference data and ensure that there are checks and balances. I might add that, although this relates particularly to the Australian Taxation Office, the systems that have been developed with respect to several state jurisdictions actually involve a similar approach around the question of cross-matching of data in order to ensure that people are given the maximum opportunity to ensure they are on the electoral roll. I think that is an important principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to those who would argue that automatic enrolment opens a door to fraud, I would say it opens a door to greater levels of participation by people who are fully entitled to do so. It gives them the opportunity to take part in the democratic process. The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, raised some points about the question of this being an evil plot by the Labor Party to ensure that, through changes to the electoral roll, we would increase our capacity to be elected at the next election. There has been comment on this publicly. Frankly, what is really clear is that, when it comes to the question about any impact some of these changes might have on any electoral result, it is absolutely minimal, but it does take into account that key point around the issue of ensuring that all Australians have the right to participate in our democratic system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will speak briefly about a couple of other points that were made about some of the amendments that are here. As I said, I do not think there are a lot of matters here of great significance—and certainly of partisan politics—but I mentioned one. The other couple I will mention go to the issue of the signing of pre-poll certificates by voters, which, again, was mentioned by a previous speaker as having the potential for voter fraud. Frankly, it is about removing unnecessary processes that cause greater administrative difficulties with the whole question of the conduct of these ballots. Frankly, it will not have an impact with respect to fraud. It is part of a wider argument that is often raised around the issue of the potential for multiple voting. Time and time again, the Australian Electoral Commission has produced detailed research showing that, for all of the huff and puff that goes on from some about the potential for this to occur, it just does not. The fact is that our system is one we can all be very proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of applications for pre-polls and the fact that there would be a longer period to allow pre-polling to occur, and the question of what has been occurring in more recent times, it is a recognition of the fact that more and more Australians are availing themselves of the opportunity to vote in the lead-up to election day rather than on election day. To be honest, I have some concerns about that, in terms of the question of how you conduct a campaign and ensure that you give people the opportunity to have the information before them to make a decision before they cast their vote. The more people who exercise that right prior to polling day the more people might be in a situation where they are not always in possession of all the facts. Having said that, it is a fact of modern Australian society that the mobility of people and the circumstances of their health have led to a situation where more and more people are availing themselves of that opportunity. In those circumstances I really do not see what the problem is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a good system, a system we can all be proud of. We are in a situation where this legislation is part of an ongoing process that all governments engage in with respect to the finetuning of an electoral system that is the envy of the world. We ought to be proud of it. We ought to be proud of being part of the system and what it produces. We should pass these amendments because they are part of making sure that the system keeps pace with the times.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="217266" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  There is nothing more fundamental to democracy than elections, and there is nothing more important to proper, honest and fair elections than the integrity of the electoral rolls, the very rock upon which our electoral system stands. Today's bill includes provisions that represent a further attack on the integrity and accuracy of the electoral roll. It is for that reason that I rise to speak today on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Administration) Bill 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to implement seven recommendations contained in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report following the 2010 federal election: <span style="font-style:italic;">The 2010 federal election: report on the conduct of the election and related matters</span>. The bill was first introduced on 29 November 2012 and was referred by the selection committee to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for further scrutiny, through which the committee released its report on 27 February 2012, with the coalition providing a dissenting report to note its opposition to some components of the bill. Specifically, the coalition opposes recommendations 3, 10 and 11. Recommendation 3 includes further changes as to how information is added to the electoral roll by allowing the Australian Taxation Office to share information with the Australian Electoral Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously spoken in this House about my commitment to the integrity of the electoral roll, a system whereby each individual elector acts on their own initiative to comply with the responsibilities that come with being a resident of Australia. In March last year the government passed in the House the Electoral and Referendum (Maintaining Address) Bill and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill, which allowed automatic enrolment based on an elector changing their address with the Department of Human Services, state and territory motor registries or Australia Post. This has created the potential that at no stage is the actual elector involved in changing their electoral address. Instead, if they change their address with the previously mentioned bodies the AEC will post a letter to their proposed new address to confirm the change. If they do not respond, the AEC will go about changing their address anyway. This is a serious concern because we know that only 20 per cent of electors respond to letters from the Electoral Commission. Even more alarming is that last year's changes mean that now someone can be added to the electoral roll without their prior knowledge and without their consent. There is no signature required, and not even a required acknowledgment that the elector understands the rights and responsibilities that come with being on the electoral roll. They might simply get a learner's permit from a convenient motor registry and then, without their knowledge and without their consent, a public servant sitting in Canberra comes across their information and puts them on the electoral roll or changes their enrolment details.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One particular argument often used in the defence of making voting compulsory in Australia is that voting should be considered to be not merely a civil right but also one's civic duty. The argument maintains that it is the responsibility of every single person capable of casting a vote at an election to educate themselves about the issues and to vote accordingly. Indeed, it is technically compulsory in this nation for someone to not just attend a voting booth but to specifically mark their preference on their ballot paper, thereby making a deliberate informal vote illegal—although of course there are ways around that obligation. If we were to accept that argument we must also accept that attempts to reduce or remove the responsibility of Australians to engage with the electoral process must not occur. Yet this is exactly what automatic enrolment does. It takes the responsibility away from the elector and places it in the hands of a public servant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Automatic enrolment and the further dilution of the integrity of the electoral roll will be a huge problem, potentially, for thousands of students who reside at the 11 colleges at the University of Queensland. Just last Friday my office dropped off forms so that more than 2,000 students in St Lucia can ask to check their enrolment status. Many of those students may reside at the college while their electoral address may be thousands of kilometres away. With automatic enrolment their address may be changed, as I have said, without their consent and without their knowledge, so they may show up on election day having no idea that their electoral address has changed, which could impair their ability to cast a formal vote at their correct address in the correct electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill adds further ambiguity to the electoral roll because it includes legislative changes to the Taxation Administration Act, which governs the protection of personal data collected by the ATO. This means that the ATO will be allowed to provide personal information and data to the AEC for the purposes of automatic enrolment. The coalition has warned this government previously about what damage could occur if the AEC uses information from the ATO to update the electoral roll, because there are very serious questions about the accuracy of the data it keeps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there was a very extensive and thorough review in the Australian National Audit Office report on the management of tax files numbers considered by a House Standing Committee on Economics, Financial and Public Administration in 1999. From that report the House discovered that there were 3.2 million more tax file numbers than people in Australia when compared with the most recent census. There are 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for individuals and, very alarmingly, 62 per cent of deceased clients were not recorded as deceased in a sample match. There is no reason to suggest that in 2013 the records of the ATO are any more accurate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government majority report maintains that the AEC should be able to use a so-called 'trusted' data source and that the AEC by itself can declare whether or not it thinks a data source is trustworthy. However, when there are so many gaps and mistakes, which I have just mentioned, we must question the very integrity of that data and whether the ATO can be considered to be a trusted data source. As the coalition's dissenting report noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The inclusion of such data, if erroneous, would be extremely damaging to public faith in our electoral process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In simple terms, where there are such examples of inconsistency in Commonwealth data, there cannot be sufficient faith in this data being used to automatically add people to the electoral roll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, there are very important privacy concerns that this change introduces. Previously, the ATO has always claimed that it maintains the highest level of confidentiality when it comes to a taxpayer's personal information. With today's proposed changes, the ATO will be able to pass on confidential information to the AEC without the individual taxpayer's knowledge or consent. This is a dangerous path that the Labor government is following. Bit by bit, the Labor Party is increasing government scope in our lives—and not only in the electoral process. With so many other regulations and policies, it proposes to increase taxes on families to regulate what we can or cannot say and to regulate what we can and cannot see in the media. With these changes to the Electoral Act, the Labor government is sending the message that your personal, private information is not your property because, once it ends up in the hands of a government bureaucrat, they can do whatever they want with your information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, the coalition remains opposed to automatic enrolment and the provision within this bill which provides for the Australian Taxation Office to release a taxpayer's personal data for the purpose of automatic enrolment. What the AEC should be concentrating on is continually checking the accuracy of the roll and advertising to ensure that people are aware of their obligations to properly enrol initially and to then advise the AEC of a change of address, should it occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also enacts recommendation 10, reducing the responsibilities of an elector should they complete a pre-poll ordinary vote. Currently, if someone wishes to complete a pre-poll vote, they must complete and sign a certificate declaring their identity. This bill removes that requirement. It is not an onerous task for an elector to provide a simple signature so that the AEC can ensure that fraudulent and multiple voting does not occur in elections. Given the inherent difficulty for the AEC to successfully prosecute a case where they believe someone has engaged in fraudulent or multiple voting, which has been previously noted by the committee, we must not introduce changes which make that activity easier or more likely to occur. We do not want the onerous requirement of someone, for example, having to prove their identity with a drivers licence—I am not suggesting that—but it is not onerous for someone to sign a form so that the AEC can protect against voter fraud. Therefore, I oppose removing the requirement for electors to sign a certificate when they cast a pre-poll vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition further opposes the provision in this bill which adopts recommendation 11 of the electoral matters committee report to provide that pre-poll voting cannot commence earlier than four days after the date fixed for the declaration of nominations for an election. This would allow for pre-poll voting to occur on the Monday 19 days prior to the general election date, a change from the current practice of opening pre-poll voting on the Monday 12 days prior to the election date. There are significant concerns about this change being implemented as it would take the focus away from the polling day itself. Ultimately, while pre-poll voting is an important way through which those with health issues or those who travel can be engaged with democracy and vote at an election, we must also accept that the appropriate day for the overwhelming majority of votes to be cast is the declared general election day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the coalition does support those parts of this bill which relate to four recommendations of the original Electoral Matters Committee report—firstly, recommendation 9: to amend the act where appropriate 'to specifically provide that a ballot box containing votes cast by electors may not be opened before the close of polling other than in accordance with the relevant provisions of the act'; secondly, recommendation 15: to amend the act to provide 'that the deadline for the receipt of postal vote applications be 6 pm on the Wednesday, three days before polling day'; thirdly, recommendation 29: to amend the act to provide 'that, where an augmented Electoral Commission has formed an opinion that its proposed redistribution is significantly different to the Redistribution Committee proposal, a further fixed period be provided during which the actions required by subsection 72(13) of the act are to be undertaken'; and, fourthly, recommendation 30: to provide that 'the number of days specified in subsection 72(2) of the act also be increased by the same number of days provided for in the further fixed period' in the case that an individual or an organisation makes a further objection. The coalition supports these necessary changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to again thank members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for their commitment to the electoral and referendum acts, and particularly thank the member for Mackellar for her decades-long commitment to the integrity of the electoral roll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, it is inconceivable that the government cannot be alert to the real issues raised by these amendments. Our concerns are born of a genuine belief that something so fundamental as the integrity of our electoral system must be protected by legislation which reflects that importance—legislation that secures that integrity by spelling out in the clearest terms how it is to be protected, and legislation that acknowledges that a flawed protection of our electoral rolls must inevitably lead to the wrong candidates being elected. It is as stark as that. Any attempt to reduce the integrity of our electoral roll—a cornerstone of our democracy—must be opposed, and that is why I oppose this bill in its current form.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I want to congratulate the Special Minister of State for bringing the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Administration) Bill 2012 forward. Like Work Choices, it corrects one of the great conservative overreaches made when, in their hubris, the previous government had control of the Senate. This bill gives effect to recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which I had the honour to serve from 2001 to 2010, part of the time as deputy chair, when we were in opposition. As a result of that committee experience, I am very familiar with the issues and the government's wider project of electoral reform.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has one of the best electoral systems at the federal level in the world. The combination of single-member seats in the House of Representatives, proportional representation in the Senate, preferential voting in all elections and compulsory voting is uniquely Australian. It gives stable majority government most of the time in the Lower House, and there are occasional hung parliaments, as we have at this time. It gives minor parties a voice in the Senate without allowing them to destabilise governments and it ensures that every Australian citizen participates in our democratic process so that every citizen shares responsibility for the outcome of elections. But our system is not perfect. It requires regular updating to ensure that we maximise electoral participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that in the period of the previous conservative government a deliberate tactic was entered into where slowly, salami style, various categories of Australians were excluded from the roll. It is not good enough that we have as a result of that process an estimated 15.7 million Australians eligible to be enrolled but only 14.2 million actually enrolled. If we are to make voting compulsory—and I strongly believe that we should; that is our system and we are all, on a non-partisan basis, committed to it—we need to ensure that, logically and rationally, every Australian has the ability to vote by being enrolled. At the moment we are clearly not doing enough to ensure this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might point out that this is in part a problem we have created for ourselves. As I said, I think part of it was a deliberate tactic by the previous conservative government. Over decades people were taken off the electoral roll and very happily not put back on. In the previous system with snail mail only 20 per cent of people responded to changes of address inquiries by the AEC and gradually we have had this problem of 1.5 million Australians being off the electoral roll. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1987 the Hawke government proposed the Australia Card as a solution to identity problems and actually won a double dissolution election on this issue but, because of obstruction in the Senate, the proposal was never put into effect. We are now paying a price for that failure with over one million eligible Australian citizens not on the electoral roll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has recently legislated to move to automatic enrolment. Recent amendments to the Electoral Act allow the AEC to enrol an unenrolled person without a claim being lodged by that person and to update or transfer a person's enrolment without an application from that person provided that the AEC is certain, on the basis of available information, of that person's current address. This will enable the AEC to place most of those people who are currently unenrolled on the rolls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Ryan painted this as some kind of Labor conspiracy, whereas in fact the government of New South Wales does this. Are they part of some Labor conspiracy? Has Barry O'Farrell's mind been colonised by Minister Gray? Of course not. This is not a conspiracy. This is a reaction to modernity when people travel and are not available on the day and when people do not respond to snail mail. Very few people make the deliberate decision not to enrol to vote. Most of those who are not enrolled have failed to enrol out of ignorance or forgetfulness, as we can see from the rush of last-minute enrolments that we always get when an election is announced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker, the member for Ryan, said that using the tax office was some kind of socialist conspiracy to steal people's rights. Of course, all previous conservative governments since the early 1980s have used the Transport Accident Commission and many other databases in order to do the continuous roll updates that form the basis of them writing letters to people to seek their enrolment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation refines the process of enrolment. The bill facilitates automatic enrolment of eligible people by allowing the Taxation Commissioner to disclose information to the AEC for roll update and maintenance purposes. Only information obtained by the Taxation Commissioner on or after the day this bill is assented to can be disclosed to the AEC. What that means in short is that the AEC will be able to determine a person's current address by, amongst other things, accessing information held by the ATO. Of course, no other taxation information can or will be disclosed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way the highly competent Electoral Commission organises this is to correlate various databases, so the ATO information will not be the only information that it correlates. Since most people pay their taxes—even those who have forgotten to enrol to vote—this will enable the AEC to gradually put more people on the rolls over the years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another section of this bill deals with procedures for people casting their vote at a pre-polling place—that is, at a place which is open before polling day. This is an increasingly urgent question. As I said, it is a question of modernity, not of conspiracy. Due to changes in people's work and leisure habits, it is no longer convenient for every Australian to vote on the Saturday in the traditional way. An increasing proportion of voters cast postal votes or a pre-poll vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Melbourne Ports at the 2010 election 5.5 per cent of people cast a pre-poll vote while 11 per cent did a postal vote. It is very interesting that this inner-city electorate cast that many postal votes, as the number was competitive with some of the more remote electorates in Australia that had a very high number of postal votes but obviously for very different reasons. It is international context rather than conspiracy. Twenty-five per cent of people at the recent United States election for the presidency of the United States voted before election day. This is the future. This is how Australia, too, has to move. That is why these moves on prepolling are very au fait with the way modern society is moving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, as I said, a total of 16.7 per cent of people, the highest in Australia, either cast a prepoll or postal vote. The reason for that is not like, say, in the electorate of Maranoa where geographic remoteness causes people to cast a postal vote. It is that we have a very large percentage of Jewish Australians who do not vote on a Saturday and seek to vote by prepoll or by postal vote. They do not do this to pull some kind of trick; it is because of their cultural or religious observance. Yet the Electoral Act as it stands treats prepoll voters with unjustified suspicion by requiring them to fill out and sign a form stating that they are eligible to vote before they can be given a ballot paper. It seems to me to be insulting to these voters that the Electoral Act makes it more difficult to cast a vote on the Wednesday before an election than on the Saturday of an election itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said many times in debates of this sort, we have not only one of the best but also one of the cleanest election systems in the world. Numerous inquiries by the joint standing committee have shown that there is no evidence whatever of any significant level of electoral fraud or malpractice in Australian federal elections. There is therefore no justification for putting obstacles in the path of Australian citizens who want to cast their vote by prepoll. This bill does away with the requirement for prepoll voters to sign a declaration and I know many people in my electorate will welcome that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years between 1990 and 2012 there were six electoral events, including a referendum, at which 72 million Australians voted. The Electoral Commission at the end of the day referred to the police 72 cases of electoral fraud in those six electoral events—one case per million people. The member for Mackellar goes on and on about the integrity of the electoral roll, but we have integrity in the electoral roll. What we have is the democratic problem of 1.5 million Australians not being on the roll because they have been deliberately excluded by a Tory plan that took a number of years to get into practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very unfortunate that the opposition is opposing aspects of this bill. It is unfortunate but not surprising, because the whole trend of Liberal and National Party policy in this area has been to restrict rather than enhance the right and ability of Australians to enrol and to vote. The Howard government in its last term passed amendments to the Electoral Act that made it significantly harder for people who did not have drivers licences or passports to enrol and cast a prepoll or postal vote. There was a scandalous growth in the number of people between the 2004 and 2007 elections who applied for provisional votes on the day and were excluded because of the restrictive requirements that were put in by the Howard government. I suspect it was because many of those people lived in apartments, were more mobile and were younger and the Howard government suspected that they might vote against them. All Australians have the right to vote and these provisions between 2004 and 2007 saw the number of people having their provisional vote submitted go down from 80 per cent in 2004 to, in 2007, in many cases less than 50 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One must ask why the opposition, when they were in government, moved to make it harder for Australians to enrol and to vote, and why now, in opposition, they are resisting our moves to make it easier to enrol and to vote. The answer is quite simply that they believe it is in their political interests to do so. They calculate that the voters they disenfranchised through their restrictive measures, and whose re-enfranchisement they are now opposing, are more likely to be Labor voters than conservative voters. The member on our side who previously spoke believes that it is neutral, but I think there is probably some truth to the idea that younger and more transient voters may vote for us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In going down this anti-democratic path, however, the opposition is once again following their mentors, the right wing of the US Republican Party. All through last year we saw attempts by Republican governors to make it harder for people in their states to register to vote and to cast their votes. They did this in a blatant attempt to rig the electoral system against the President of the United States, President Obama, and in favour of Governor Romney. Fortunately, most of their efforts were overturned in the courts. Last November, we saw where all of these Republican attempts to deny people the right to vote finished up. In fact, it was a cause celebre in the United States that people were faced with these electoral restrictions and more people turned out—and more people turned out early, I would suggest—as a result of these attempts to change the electoral system. I suggest the same thing will happen to the opposition in this country unless they change their tactics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue addressed by this bill is the real issue of democratic deficit in Australia—that is, is the 1.5 million Australians disenfranchised by the continuous restrictive elements that were put into practice by the previous conservative government between the time of their election in 1996 and 2007. Enrolling people with the proper integrity is the great democratic purpose of this legislation and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Administration) Bill 2012 is the third bill on which I have spoken regarding reforms to the administration of our electoral system. I have a great passion for expanding our democracy. That passion is shared by a great number of electors in Fraser. At last count, we had 131,000 electors in Fraser. That compares to an average of 94,000 electors per electorate at the last election. Mine is either the largest or the second largest electorate in Australia, and I welcome more people onto the roll in the ACT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before this bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Procedure) Bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Protecting Elector Participation) Bill introduced important amendments to enhance voter participation and update the electoral roll. We have introduced this suite of changes because, unlike our conservative counterparts, we understand how crucial inclusion and participation are to our system of democracy. That passion for expanding access to democracy is centuries old. It goes back to the times when William Wentworth, a conservative, campaigned to maintain the property qualification for voting. It goes back to those conservatives who stood against expanding the suffrage to women in Australia. It goes also today, in Queensland, to those members of the Queensland LNP who are campaigning to get rid of compulsory voting. At every turn you see progressives wanting to expand the franchise and conservatives opposing expansion and wanting shrinkage of the franchise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is fundamentally part of a fair go. I want people on the electoral roll regardless of how they vote because I believe the very act of participating in our democratic process is an important one. I will often urge young people who are interested in politics to get involved in political parties. It is great if they want to get involved in my political party, but if they want to get involved in another political party that too is a good thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces administrative procedures to assist the Australian Electoral Commission in producing a more inclusive electoral roll and timely processing of postal vote applications. That will include bringing forward the date to dispatch voting materials for postal votes. It will include allowing the Australian Electoral Commission to receive certain information from the Taxation Office for enrolments and updating enrolments. In themselves these are small steps, but they are part of that bigger story of democracy, civic engagement, inclusion and using the role of government to strengthen our great democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is Canberra's birthday. It is appropriate to acknowledge the words of Walter Burley Griffin, who said that he was designing a city for a nation of 'bold democrats'. Bold democrats should want everyone to participate in our electoral process and that means administrative amendments that expand the franchise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of eligible voters who are not on the electoral roll has risen significantly since 2001. Without the administrative changes introduced to enhance electoral procedures and voter participation, on average 10,000 eligible voters per electorate would have been unable to cast their votes later this year and to exercise their right to elect their political representatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are only a dozen or so nations around the world that have compulsory voting. We have compulsory voting because we believe that with rights come responsibilities, that it is the responsibility of everyone to have their say in the democratic process. Indeed, as a Centre for Independent Studies report pointed out a number of years ago, getting rid of compulsory voting would lead to a bias in those who remain. In which way would it bias? It was quite clear from the authors, Derek Chong, Sinclair Davidson and Tim Fry, that getting rid of compulsory voting would advantage the conservative side of politics and it would do so not in a fair manner because those who voted under voluntary voting would be unrepresentative of the Australian population as a whole. As a social laboratory for the world, we have been a world leader in implementing compulsory voting and it is a good and important reform that ensures inclusion. It ensures that those of us in this place are an accurate representation of the political views of the Australian people. Voluntary voting would breach that guarantee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposing these reforms, the opposition is again demonstrating a preference for political gain over the national interest, the democratic interest, of all Australians, over the right to vote and the right to ensure that our parliament is representative of the population as a whole. Why won't it support these amendments? Part of the answer is in a November 2011 radio interview from the opposition leader. He said that only the right kids should stay on at school beyond year 10. He said, 'It's all very well and good keeping kids at school past year 10 but they've got to be the right kids.' It appears here that that is the approach the opposition is taking to electoral reform: 'We want voters but only the right sorts of voters.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition attempted to block a bill that would make it easier for Australians to vote by lowering the provisional age at which young Australians can register to vote. When that bill came before the House in 2010, the member for Eden-Monaro correctly stated, 'I think that Tony Abbott needs to explain to the Australian people why he does not want to make it easy for them to enrol and vote in the forthcoming election.' We know the answer, as the member for Melbourne Ports has pointed out. Statistically, it is likely that, as you increase the number of younger people on the rolls, they will not be natural supporters of the coalition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle here is the principle of expanding the franchise. We need more civic engagement. And that is in the face of a decline in civic engagement. In my book <span style="font-style:italic;">Disconnected</span>, I charted not only the collapse of Australian political party membership right across the spectrum but also a decline over recent decades in the share of Australians casting a valid vote. What do you have to do to cast a valid vote? You have to do two things. You have to show up to the polling booth and not spoil the ballot paper. Despite an increase in education levels in Australia, we have seen a decrease in the share of electors casting a valid vote, with now a 10th of the citizenry effectively failing to participate in the poll, either by not turning up or by spoiling the ballot paper. In that environment it is absolutely critical that we expand the democratic process, that we ensure that more and more people can be engaged.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was somewhat surprising recently to see defence of an inclusive democracy and election system coming from an unlikely source in Queensland. In January this year, the Newman government released a discussion paper that raised the prospect of scrapping compulsory voting in state elections. Clive Palmer responded to the proposal with the following tweet:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Qld govt plan to scrap compulsory voting shows it's panicking about loss of support. Compulsory voting a feature of our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And in a media release he made the perfectly sensible point:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The more people who participate in a democracy the better and it is good for the whole country if citizens accept the responsibility to vote.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to see a preview of what Australia might look like were the Leader of the Opposition to move to this side of the House then you only have to look at the Newman government in Queensland. It is, frankly, a shame that some of the LNP in Queensland do not understand, as it turns out Mr Palmer does, that participation in the democratic process is essential to a fair society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Gray argued earlier this year that Australia's electoral system should not be changed for the sake of protecting partisan political interests. He correctly identified concern about the increase in informal voting and the need to address this. While I am not sure Minister Gray would regard Clive Palmer as being his natural ally, the point is indeed clear. As the minister has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Electoral Commission received over 800,000 postal vote applications at the 2010 election. It is an increasingly popular way to cast a ballot. This bill will amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act to remove the requirement for a prepoll ordinary vote applicant to complete and sign a certificate. The Australian Electoral Commission will be assisted in processing the applications for postal votes by bringing forward by one day the dispatch of postal voting materials. The bill clarifies that prepoll voting can only commence on the fourth day following the declaration of nominations. In addition, a small amendment to the Taxation Administration Act allows certain personal information collected by the Australian Taxation Office to be received by the Electoral Commission. This information, obtained from a credible government source, will enable the commission to update the electoral roll so that it is as inclusive as possible, demonstrating a commitment to ensuring that as many Australians as possible can have their say in our great democracy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The progressive tradition of supporting democratic participation is a fundamental Labor value. Labor believes that every Australian should have their say in the future of Australia. We are committed to ensuring that everyone who is eligible has a say in the nation's future, because we are the party of democracy and of the franchise. The right role of government is to protect the rights of Australians to put their mark on the ballot paper and make it possible for them to do so. The right role of government is to ensure that we get those estimated 1½ million voters who are off the electoral roll involved in elections. That comes from fundamental values which are not just Labor values; they are Australian values—equity, fairness and participation. People who are voting for the first time should be encouraged to get on the roll. That means all of them—not just what the Leader of the Opposition might call the right voters but all voters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These administrative changes are part of a larger story, a story central to Australia. They are part of an Australia which has always believed in inclusion, civic engagement and democracy. It is an Australian tradition which does not look at politics through a partisan lens and recognises that we must always welcome greater participation and ensure that those who move are able to stay on the electoral roll, that young Australians are encouraged to join the electoral roll and that new citizens are able to join the electoral roll. It is always a great pleasure and a privilege to speak at citizenship ceremonies, to speak to people who are joining the Australian project for the first time. I often say at those ceremonies that the new citizens are now part of a larger Australian project, a project which stretches back generations. It is not just a project run by politicians; it is the job of all of us to leave Australia a little better than we found it. The way in which new citizens so often look to do that is by getting on the electoral roll and getting involved in elections. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These democracy-enhancing reforms are fundamentally about ensuring that movers, young Australians, new citizens and, frankly, those who are just a little bit forgetful do not get left out of our great democracy. Just because you forget to update your details to the Australian Electoral Commission it does not mean that we should not help ensure that you have your say in our nation's future. Australia's democracy is too important to be left to a small portion of Australians. The job of Australia's democracy falls on all of us, and that is why we must do all we can to expand the franchise. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  I speak in support of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. The purpose of this bill is to make changes in relation to the baby bonus. It comes as a result of what we announced in the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The amendments will change the support not for new parents but for second and third children and beyond. We are maintaining support for new parents with their up-front costs with the baby bonus. From 1 July 2013, the Baby bonus for second and subsequent children will be reduced to $3,000. The baby bonus will continue to be paid at the current rate of $5,000 for a first child. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have two children—they were born a long time ago—but I daresay most of the people in this chamber would have had children. The reality is that your first child incurs the most cost with all the things you need for maintaining a child—whether it is a pram or a nursery. A child changes not just the time, energy and lifestyle of parents, but it changes their finances as well. We are maintaining that support for the up-front costs for the first child or a multiple birth—twins, triplets, etcetera—but in relation to subsequent children—where they may, for example, have the pram or have the nursery or the beds set up—in those circumstances we are making changes. This will provide savings of between $500 million and $600 million over four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things that we have done to improve the life and lifestyle of Australian families and I will come to those shortly. We are ensuring eligibility for the family tax benefit until the end of a calendar year for young people who complete secondary study or its equivalent in either November or December of that year. Additionally, the bill provides the qualification for a double-orphan pension being extended so that it aligns with eligibility for family tax benefit. There is a huge amount I could say about what this government has provided to Australian families and particularly those in my electorate. One of the things I am most proud of is helping dads take time off to spend with their babies. That is a tremendous thing that we have done from 1 January this year—putting that as an option, for their babies to have the best start in life and ensure that the mother is supported by the father of that child. To the tune of about $600 a week before tax at the minimum rate for two weeks, it allows the parents to establish patterns in life, which my generation never experienced. I think that is particularly important. There are, of course, tests in relation to that, but the vast majority of people in my electorate will benefit from that change and have already done so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking to young families in shopping centres like Yamanto Village, Winston Glades, Brassall or River link about those issues—and I have spoken to many, many people—this particular reform is one of the most important changes the federal Labor government has made. The paid parental leave scheme that we have brought in has seen literally thousands of people in my electorate given the option of not using the baby bonus. More than 160,000 people have taken up this option. It is another initiative of this federal Labor government—a first for our country. The other assistance that has been commented on locally is the schoolkids bonus—that baby becomes a child very quickly and a school kid very quickly. They grow up so quickly—from toddler to pre-school to school. I remember talking very recently at Raceview State Primary School to young mothers, often with young babies in their arms, about the schoolkids bonus. It is another great initiative that this government has brought in—$410 per child at primary school and $820 for high school. We have seen the benefit of that. We on this side understand helping young families who have young children who at that stage often have the highest rate of mortgage or rent and the most stress they will ever have—helping them with the dads and partners bonus or the schoolkids bonus or paid parental leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these things make a huge difference to their lives. That is why I just cannot understand the attitude of those opposite to the schoolkids bonus. Having supported an education tax refund, they are now opposed to a schoolkids bonus. In my electorate some families will lose $15,000 during the time their kids are at school. I just can't understand that the young mother I spoke to outside Raceview State Primary School, who sends her kids there and then on to Bremer State High School, will lose $15,000 if the Leader of the Opposition gets into government. We have seen $588 million injected into the economy through the schoolkids bonus and it has helped 16,100 local families. We should be providing help for families. That is what this government is doing—helping young families in particular. We have high growth, low unemployment, low inflation, a strong economy and low interest rates. Those young families with kids at primary school are the ones who are now paying on average much less in interest rates than under the coalition government. Interest rates rose ten times in a row under John Howard and the coalition and now under this government they are so much lower. That is because of the prudence of this Labor government's management of the economy. It is managing the economy in the best interests of the country and in the best interests of families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will save money, but it has to be seen in the context of all the other things we have done—dad and partner pay; paid parental leave; the schoolkids bonus; the tax cuts for that mother who might be working part time; raising the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 and, in the next year so, to $19,400—to be clawed back by the coalition if they get into power—the family tax benefit rises; and the pension rises. I was talking to a fellow last Saturday at Winston Glades shopping centre at Yamanto. The guy was on an age pension—getting the benefit of our increases to the age pension—and he had a couple of kids and a wife from Indonesia. He told me that they were getting the benefit of so many of our reform—the schoolkids bonus, for example. He was horrified when he found out that the coalition would take that away from him, that they would take away his pension rises and his schoolkids bonus—so many of the things which help his young family and help him to support his two kids, who are both at Raceview State Primary School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are doing in this legislation must be seen in the context of everything we are doing—that is, providing help for families; making sure they get a decent lifestyle; making sure they have a roof over their head; ensuring their kids are educated to enable them to achieve their full potential; ensuring their financial security through low interest rates; making sure they have money in their pocket to pay for that computer, those sports shoes or those music lessons; and giving them just a little bit of a helping hand with the cost of living. This government is committed to that. I say to the electors in my electorate of Blair: whether you are sending your kids to Raceview Primary, to Silkstone State School, to Redbank Plains State School at Redbank Plains, to Milford Street Kindergarten or wherever, we will be there for you. Whether your child is born at St Andrew's Hospital or Ipswich General Hospital, we will be there for you. This government has provided; those opposite will not.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  The Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 is a bill from a Labor government which has not only lost its way but has lost what were once bipartisan values of supporting families and helping parents. The honourable member for Blair, who preceded me in this debate, made constant reference to the education bonus as if it were something completely new. What the government did was replace an old tax rebate with the education bonus. Most people who are in receipt of that bonus would have been in receipt of the rebate under the former system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does not support this government's continuing attack on families through this bill. The coalition will always stand up for Australian families. What this bill seeks to do is to bury a change to the baby bonus in a range of other measures. I will concentrate on the most significant part of this proposed legislation, namely the changes to the baby bonus. This bill seeks to implement Labor's change to the baby bonus, a change announced in the 2012-13 Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The amount of the baby bonus for second and subsequent children who come into a family from 1 July this year will be reduced under this bill to $3,000. This change will apply generally, regardless of whether the child is born into the family, adopted by the family or entrusted to the family's care within 26 weeks of birth—under, for example, a foster care arrangement. The baby bonus will continue to be paid at the rate of $5,000 for the family's first child and for each child who comes into the family in a multiple birth, adoption or entrustment-to-care situation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put this into context. The baby bonus was introduced by the coalition in 2002 for the purpose of raising Australia's declining fertility rate. This policy was a direct result of the intergenerational reports instigated by Peter Costello when he was Treasurer. What those <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eports</span> pointed out was that, for the continuing economic growth of this nation, we had to concentrate on three things—population, participation and productivity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has repeatedly slashed the baby bonus in an attempt to find savings. In the 2009-10 budget, Labor paused the indexation of the upper income limit for the baby bonus, fixing the income threshold at $75,000. In the 2011-12 Mid-year Financial and Economic Update, Labor paused the indexation of the baby bonus payment until 2014-15 and reduced the rate of payment from $5,437 to $5,000 per child. Even the language the government uses about the baby bonus is interesting. The bonus was, as I said, introduced as a measure to ensure that we stay somewhere close to a replacement fertility rate in Australia. Why is that important? It is because Australia, like many other countries around the world, has been suffering a gradually declining fertility rate. If you do not have people, you do not have people to do the jobs which this country is currently crying out to have done. If you do not have people, you negatively affect the economic growth rate of the nation. Indeed, a whole series of historical studies have shown that at least a quarter of national economic growth—not just in Australia but elsewhere around the world—comes from population growth. So, if your fertility rate is declining—if your population growth through natural means is declining—that is going to have an impact at some stage on economic development, on economic prosperity, on the economic growth of the nation. The baby bonus was a measure introduced to deal with that specific issue of fertility. But now, when we hear the Labor Party discuss it, they talk about it in welfare terms and they treat it like welfare—not only treating it like welfare but making cuts to it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the cuts made by the government which I mentioned previously, we warned that changes would further limit choice for mothers, particularly those who wish to stay at home—either for a short or temporary period of time or for a period of time while the kids are growing up and going to school—and raise their children. The reality is that Labor is ideologically opposed to stay-at-home mums. For some reason they have decided that mums should not have a choice but should just go back to work or enter the workforce after having their baby. That flies in the face of the practical experience of many families in Australia. The common income in Australia is 1¼ to 1½ jobs, where one partner—maybe the male, maybe the female—is working full time and the other is working on a part-time or casual basis, and families make arrangements over their life course appropriate to their work and family situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear about why the government wants to slash this payment. The baby bonus slash and burn exercise is expected to provide savings of $505.9 million over the four years from 2012-13 to 2015-16—$505.9 million is therefore going to be taken from the pockets of Australian families, particularly those families having children under this measure. That is half a billion dollars being ripped away from Australian families. This is nothing more than a cynical and cruel attack on families simply to help the Treasurer, Mr Swan, reduce Labor's burgeoning black hole. This is a desperate measure, ripping half a billion dollars from Australian families in order to provide a surplus—a surplus which of course will never be delivered by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is often claimed that generous provisions that enable women to enter or remain in the paid workforce contribute to higher fertility levels, hence the Australian demographer Hugo argues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the international ranking of countries according to their fertility levels matches their ranking on the extent to which they facilitate the employment of mothers in the paid workforce and the extent to which a degree of gender equity applies within the family itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other researchers have reached similar conclusions. Let us look at declining fertility over the past century. Beginning in the 1930s, Sweden introduced policies that enabled women to maintain their position in the paid workforce whilst having children. In the 1980s, the fertility rate climbed to just over two children per woman, leading some commentators to conclude that the reversal was due to the cumulative impact of public day care, child benefits, parental leave, parents' rights to work part time and other measures. These views were reinforced as female labour force participation soared to 81 per cent and the birth rate rose above replacement levels. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the growth was temporary, falling to the lowest rate ever for the country—1.52—by the end of the century. It would appear that Sweden's birth rate related to the economic cycle and the impact of the so-called 'speed premium' whereby parents were entitled to the same income replacement for a second child born within 30 months of their first, irrespective of the level of income between the two births. The policy would appear to have resulted in births being brought forward, rather than a permanent increase in the number.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It remains important to promote public policy outcomes that boost fertility rates. Prior to the baby bonus being introduced, the fertility rate in Australia had fallen to less than 1.9 children per woman, when our replacement birth rate is 2.1. Policies such as the baby bonus, along with other policies that were introduced by the Howard government, are critical to encouraging fertility. Our public policies should seek to maintain at least a replacement birth rate. People sometimes say that, if you do not have a replacement birth rate, you can make up for it with immigration. The problem with immigration is that the average age of immigrants who come to this country is about the average of the population, and so they age along with the rest of us and it does not help our birth rate. Only, theoretically, if you could somehow attract a larger, much younger cohort of immigrants could you offset some of the effects of a declining fertility rate, but the reality is we are in competition for those young skilled immigrants from all over the world—competition with countries like Canada and the United States—and therefore we cannot attract that larger cohort of younger immigrants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Singapore provides a classic study of what happens with fertility rates once they go down. Dr Tony Tan, when Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, announced that their government would fund $50 million over five years to educate the public on family life. The Singapore study illustrates that the birth rate, having been driven down from high levels in the 1950s and 1960s, has got down to about 1.2 or 1.3 and, despite a series of efforts over the last 10 or 15 years, with all sorts of inducements such as health care, accommodation assistance et cetera, it has been very difficult to get the fertility rate back up. Given that Singapore is a small and in some senses closed society, it provides an illustration, a case study if you like, of what happens to a nation when the fertility rate drops below a certain level. It seems to me, from studies that have been carried out around the world, that if your fertility rate gets below about 1.4 or 1.5 it is extremely difficult to raise that fertility rate again, and that has medium- and long-term consequences for that society, for that country—and one of those consequences, as I indicated before, is a decline in what would otherwise have been the economic growth of the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most governments have sought to provide economic support for families. Using the rhetoric of 'family friendly policies', measures range from direct taxation and social security benefits to parental leave and flexible working hours. These policies often have the twin objectives of encouraging fertility and supporting families in the raising of their children. France, for example, has a deliberate third child policy. Whereas Australia, for example, currently pays a bonus on the birth of each child—that will be diminished if this legislation passes—France pays a greater amount for third and subsequent children. This is in addition to parental and maternity leave and childcare and family allowances. The interesting thing about France is that France is one of the few countries that has maintained a birth rate somewhere close to replacement levels. They have done that by saying it is those families who are prepared to have more than two children—those who are prepared to have three or four children—that will bring about the greatest increase in the birth rate of a country. These policies have meant that France's birth rate has stabilised at around 1.9, one of the highest in the Western world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So public policy motives underpinned the coalition's decision to introduce this measure in the first place and our approach to things like promoting the fertility rate—whereas Labor's policy approach, if you can call it a policy approach, is simply about politics. They are ideologically opposed to stay-at-home mums and they are spending money they just do not have. So, to them, this is a measure that attacks a group they already oppose and helps them scrape some more money to put towards their skyrocketing debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The baby bonus payments made to families for subsequent births are important. The third birth particularly helps Australia's fertility rate. And—on our approach to parental support—the coalition have a plan to provide a first-class paid parental leave system. We have announced that and we will deliver that. But recognising that some parents do stay at home with their child is equally important. As I said earlier, families make arrangements not just from week to week or month to month; most families make arrangements over a lifetime in which, if not both partners, at least one partner moves in and out of the workforce, which of course they do to balance their work and family commitments. This government has again sought to attack stay-at-home mums and, therefore, to attack the decisions and arrangements that many families make. The coalition oppose this attack, and therefore we will oppose this bill.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I take this opportunity, Mr Deputy Speaker Cheeseman, to congratulate you on your elevation to the Speaker's panel. I believe this is the first time that I have spoken while you are in the chair, but I have been watching your contribution and have seen what a fine job you are doing as a deputy speaker, so congratulations. I know that you will bring great dignity to the role and that you will perform the task extremely well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While listening to the last contribution to this debate on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013, that by the member for Menzies, I became quite puzzled. Here was a member from the other side talking about the government ripping money away from families. But, as I found myself thinking, it is the opposition that are the side of this parliament that is about ripping money away from families. They have a plan—they definitely have a plan—for Australian families. They have a plan to penalise Australian families. They have a plan to make it harder for Australian families. They have a plan to take away the schoolkids bonus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to share with the House this fact: there is no initiative that the government has introduced that has been more widely embraced by families than the schoolkids bonus. Parent after parent has contacted my office saying how helpful it has been to them. Actually, my grandchildren are attending school, and my children have told me how they have been able to use that money to purchase school shoes and other things to help prepare their children for school. I would caution those on the other side of the House: if they are really about supporting and helping families, then they should be ensuring that the schoolkids bonus stays in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the baby bonus, I fully believe that the level of the baby bonus when you have your first child should be $5,000. A moment ago, I referred to my children; they all have more than one child. They had to purchase the cot, bassinette, baby bouncer and all those other things you need for that first child. It is an enormous expense. Then, when they had their second child, they still had the cot, bassinette and baby bouncer—which were also shared among their nieces and nephews—and all those things they purchased the first time. They already had that nursery furniture, so, the second time, the expenditure was not as great. The outlays they had to make were not as great.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we really want to support families, do we give them a one-off payment or do we provide them with ongoing support through a schoolkids bonus? Now, I know, because families in the Shortland electorate are telling me, that the schoolkids bonus is what they need. They need it for all their children and they need it to assist them at school. They also tell me that the changes to dental care for kids are something that will help them no end because, instead of families having to scrimp and save to maybe be able to afford dental treatment for their child, from July 2014 all children will be eligible for the kids dental care program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are among the things that we have delivered since we have been in government that I am not convinced the opposition would keep in place, such as the increase in the childcare rebate, the Paid Parental Leave scheme, the dads and partners leave—all things that are helping families on low and middle incomes and should not be taken away. They are things that are given to families to make their lives a lot easier and to provide them with support—and not just when the baby is born, because the expenditure gets greater as that child grows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we recognise that support for families and children is whole-of-life support. It is about ensuring that they have educational opportunities and making sure that as a government we fully fund every child's education. There is quite a strong contrast between what the New South Wales Liberal government is doing—that is, pulling $1.7 billion out of education—and what the federal Labor government are planning to do, which is to invest more in education. It is about whole-of-life support, not a one-off payment at the time a child is born.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker spent a lot of time talking about declining fertility. He believes that the way to increase fertility is a one-off baby bonus payment set at the same amount for every child people have. I have news for that member. There are many things that determine whether a woman and her partner decide to have children. They do not look just at a one-off incentive payment to have a child; they look at things such as whether they will have ongoing support once the child is born and whether they will have access to child care, which is a very important consideration when making decisions about whether or not to have a child. You need to be sure that you will have good child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the parliament we are not opposed to women choosing to be stay-at-home mums. We believe in choice. Real choice is not only about providing a baby bonus; it is also about putting in place the support structures that will enable a woman to stay at home and so allow her to choose whether to return to work. The choice is determined by child care, by paid parental leave and—to a large extent—by the availability of flexible working hours. The workplace needs to be tailored to be family friendly so that a woman or a man—whichever person chooses to be the primary carer—can adapt their work hours to fit in with their family responsibilities. It is a very complex situation. Is it a question of just throwing money at families every time they have a baby? Or is it a question of providing support for the family once a child has been born, not in a one-off payment but through access to child care, paid parental leave and proper family leave so that if a child is sick the family has options as to how the child will be looked after? It is also important to make sure that health care is in place so that families are supported in their dental and immunisation costs and in all the other costs of bringing up a child. Also important is affordable education. We on this side of the parliament have contributed significantly to providing affordable education with the introduction of the schoolkids bonus and other initiatives that increase support for families when their children are attending school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Shortland electorate there is a really good program. It is called the Better Futures program, and it has been a great success. Rather than encouraging women to have more children, the program is providing support to young women who have children before they finish their education. These young women need extra support and need to be given options in their lives. The Better Futures, Local Solutions program is operating in 10 regions throughout Australia, and the part of the Shortland electorate where it is operating is an area of acute disadvantage where one in four families is jobless and youth unemployment is very high. There are a large number of young women there who have had babies at a very young age. The Better Futures program provides hope for the future and gives young people the opportunity to succeed. It has been an outstanding success and provided a range of opportunities for young parents and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program has been delivered through a number of flexible options. There is the DALE program, which is operated through St Philips Christian College—where Kevin Berger has done an enormous amount of work—and the Local Employment Access Program, which is being operated through the San Remo Neighbourhood Centre. These programs provide support for the young women when they have children. They also help them plan the whole of their life during the years that they go from being young women—some are as young as 14—who have babies to completing their education. The program puts in place support for the women for the whole of their children's lives. These programs are more than just a one-off payment; they provide whole-of-life support for the women and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government and as a society we have to look at providing more to families than a baby bonus of $5,000 every time they have a child. I fully support the need to pay a $5,000 baby bonus to a family when they have their first child or for multiple births, regardless of birth order. If you have twins on the second time then it should be $5,000 because the outgoings, the expenses, at that time are greater.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think the real way that we can help families is by providing them with support, not only at the time of the birth. At the time of birth, the other type of support that new parents need is hands-on support such as visiting health workers to help them to come to terms with the enormous change that has taken place in their life. A lot of information is put out there about what is going to happen when you have the baby, but there is very little information put out there about afterwards. So to look at the decisions around children—having babies and fertility rates—and link that solely to the baby bonus is, I think, very, very narrow. It is an approach that I do not think will work for the betterment of our society. I believe that when parents have a second child or a third child $3,000 helps them with those initial costs, but we also need to look at this as a whole, as a big picture, in terms of what we can do to support families throughout the life of their child.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  Listening to the member for Shortland, you would think that only Labor cared for families. She knows, as do the member for La Trobe, the member for Cunningham and even you, Member for Lyons, that that is just not so. Anybody in this place, as I am sure the member for Paterson, who is sitting at the table, would agree, cares a lot about families. Families are the core of Australian society. They are very much the backbone of Australian society. They make communities run. Families are so crucial to the betterment of our society, and may it long be the case that we as a parliament can do whatever we can to help and support families, and certainly at the time of the birth of a child. As I am sure the member for Shortland, being a mother and a grandmother—and no doubt a good mother and a very good grandmother—would know, the birth of a child is a time when costs are high. As a father of three myself, I know how that can be a strain on the family's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Shortland talked of whole-of-life support, and, again, I find myself in furious agreement with her that we as a parliament should be doing everything that we can to support people from the cradle to, indeed, the grave; it is so important. She also talked of the Gonski report. I know that the Prime Minister made a big funding commitment in recent times to improving the nation's literacy for our schoolchildren. The Gonski report, which has been handed down, has good initiatives, but where is the funding for them? Where is the funding going forward for these initiatives, which, in some cases, are not going to take effect until 2019—six long years away? Where is the funding going to come from? Hopefully, it will not be coming from that side of politics, because hopefully that side of politics will not be governing; it will not be in charge of the treasury bench when these important reviews are due to take effect as legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was slightly bemused by the reference to dental care for kids. We all know that there is nothing worse than a toothache, and certainly for children a toothache can have dire implications for their ability to converse with others, their ability to learn in school or their ability to mix with others in the playground and whatever. But it was that side of politics, the Labor side, which last year made it so hard with their new dental care arrangements, their new dental care policy, for people to access the public health care that is so needed for proper dental services. Oral health is crucial to our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst talking of whole-of-life support, I should note too that I do not think any side of politics, whether federal or state politics, pays enough attention to palliative care. As politicians, we should do more to ensure that there is palliative care, particularly in regional areas. This is absolutely crucial. I am sure the member for Shortland would agree with me on the need to be able to give people in their final stages of life the dignified and caring attention that they so desperately need. In my own electorate of Riverina, in Wagga Wagga, it is such an important issue at the moment. We certainly need to improve our palliative care services. We also need to provide prostate biopsies for men, because at the moment they are not available in Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. People have to go to either Young or Griffith to access those services, which in this day and age is simply not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 because it is an important one in the life of this parliament. It is important to put on the record my feelings about what this bill will implement. Certainly a lot of people in my Riverina electorate would want me to talk about the schoolkids bonus as well as the family assistance payments. I know how many of them have actually made inquiries to my office about these very important things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements the government's changes to the baby bonus announced in the 2012 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and also makes amendments to family assistance and social security payments. As of 1 July 2013, the amount of the baby bonus for the second and subsequent children will be reduced to $3,000. This change will be reapplied regardless of whether the child is born into the family, adopted by the family or is entrusted into the family's care within 26 weeks of the child's birth. The baby bonus will continue to be paid for a family's first child, and for each child who comes into the family in a multiple birth, adoption or entrustment to care, at a rate of $5,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also make amendments to ensure that families can continue to receive the family tax benefit until the end of the calendar year in which the child finishes secondary study or its equivalent. Additionally, the qualification period for the double orphan pension is being extended so it corresponds with eligibility for the family tax benefit. As the family assistance act currently stands, under section 22B(3) a child continues to be a senior secondary schoolchild until 31 December if the day the child completes the final year of secondary school, or equivalent level education, is in December of that calendar year. If the day of completion is before December then the child continues to be a senior secondary schoolchild for a period of 28 days after completion. This allows for continued eligibility for the family tax benefit until the end of the calendar year for a child who completes secondary school in December, or for a period of 28 days if the child completes school before December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the family assistance act so that eligibility for the family tax benefit will continue until the end of the calendar year for a child who completes secondary school in either November or December of that year. The amendment confirms access to the family tax benefit until the end of the calendar year for students who complete secondary study in the usual way, normally by sitting final examinations. The amendments also ensure continued family tax benefit eligibility for a child for a period of 28 days after completion if the child completes secondary school before November.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent judgement of the Federal Court interpreted 'entrustment to care' differently to the current family assistance legislation, which provides in general that the baby bonus is payable within 52 weeks after a child is born or entrusted to an individual's care. The existing policy states that the baby bonus is payable at around the time of the child's entry into a family, when the family is likely to incur set-up costs. The judgement found that the baby bonus may be paid at some time after a child enters a person's care, when a formal process of adoption begins. This bill will make amendments to clarify the meaning of 'entrustment to care' to reflect the intended policy so the baby bonus is only paid around the time the child first enters a person's care.</span>

Whilst talking of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, I ask the government: if it is this easy to change this particular legislation, why can't it also be altered to give veterans fair and just superannuation payments? It just remains unfathomable.</span>

While I certainly do not want to talk against your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, which I fully adhere to, the member for Shortland talked of whole-of-life support, and certainly our veterans have given this country every bit of their whole-of-life support, and they do deserve—with all due respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker—to be looked after in their retirement because they lay their lives on the line for our country. To get back to the legislation, which I know you would like me to do, Mr Deputy Speaker, whilst these are minor and technical amendments in the legislation before the House, they will ensure that people receive the correct amount of quarterly payment and receive the payments at the correct time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition introduced the baby bonus in 2002 for the purpose of raising Australia's declining fertility rate. We heard the shadow minister talking about how important that was. And I can recall that the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, knew how important it was to arrest that slump in the nation's fertility rate, and obviously to increase it above the necessary two, to make sure that the Australian population grew. That is obviously very important, because as the population ages so does the reliance grow on younger people to work longer and harder to make sure that we pay the necessary pensions for retirees as well as for people who are receiving welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has repeatedly—I repeat: repeatedly—slashed funding for the baby bonus in a desperate attempt to find savings. And this is a desperate government. The Treasurer needs to balance the books. We know he is not going to produce the first surplus since 1989 under Labor. Obviously, the coalition invariably produces surpluses, but Labor's last surplus—as we heard the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, speaking of in the discussion of the matter of public importance today—was in 1989, and obviously Labor needs to begin to correct that, and this is one way that it is going to attempt to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2009-10 budget, Labor paused the indexation of the upper income limit of the baby bonus, fixing the income threshold at $75,000. Then, in the 2011-12 mid-year financial and economic update, Labor again paused indexation of the baby bonus payment until 2014-15 and reduced the rate of payment from $5,437 to $5,000 per child. Now here Labor is again, lowering the baby bonus for second children and any additional after that from $5,000 to $3,000. Why is Labor so intent on limiting choices for mothers, particularly those who wish to stay at home to raise their children? We should be encouraging, in every instance, those wonderful, brave, stay-at-home mums. All mums are great. We know that. And I am sure everybody in this parliament knows it. But those stay-at-home mums need to be helped and helped in every which way we can. Stakeholder groups who advocate for stay-at-home mothers have continually raised concerns about the inequality between paid parental leave and the baby bonus. This current move by the Labor government does nothing to address those concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will try to argue that this is not a simple money-saving measure, but we know that it is. The facts show these baby bonus changes are expected to provide savings of $505.9 million to half a billion dollars over the four years from 2012-13 to 2015-16. This cut to the baby bonus—and that is what it is; it is a cruel cut—will place further financial burdens on Australian families already struggling with the day-to-day rising costs of living, higher cost of groceries, higher cost of petrol and a carbon tax that the Prime Minister said that she would not introduce under a government she led. They are not helped by hoards of asylum seekers and by illegal refugees arriving on our shores. We are paying upwards of $170,000 per illegal boat person arrival. That is all having an effect on the ability of the government to be able to give families a fair go, because at the moment they are not getting a fair go from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims this decrease of $2,000 reflects that families do not generally face the same upfront costs for a second child or a later child as they do for their first. Whilst that is correct to some extent, this is a blow to families. It is an unnecessary and cruel blow. It is about time this government listened to families and their cries for assistance, rather than delivering them blow after blow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  I rise to speak tonight on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. As previous speakers have outlined, it contains some provisions that are largely unobjectionable: they deal with administrative arrangements and adjustments, some of which have been explained in terms of synchronicity of payments with the end of the school year and ensuring eligibility is extended to people of care responsibilities that might not have originally fallen within the scope of the legislation—that is the relatively innocuous part of the bill. What is most significant about the bill is its tax-grab character against families where there are stay-at-home parents. That has achieved a half billion dollar budget recovery hit, designed to help paper over the extraordinary budget deficits that now have become part and parcel of Labor administrations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard earlier in question time today that it was in 1989 when Labor last delivered a budget surplus. For those that think back that long, I remind them that was when Mick Hucknall had a No. 1 his song that year: <span style="font-style:italic;">If You Don't Know Me By Now</span>.

Thank you for the encouragement and a reflection on some years gone by. It was a long time ago. Mick is still around, but budget surpluses are not under Labor administrations. What the Australian public does understand and does know by now is that Labor does not deliver budget surpluses. In this bill, there is an attack on stay-at-home families with second and subsequent children to create a half a billion dollar improvement in an extraordinarily deteriorating budget position. We have seen about $172 billion worth of accumulated budget deficits—the four largest in Australia's financial history—accumulated under this administration in an effort to try and go some way towards honouring one of the rolled gold, etched in a tablet of stone, promises to restore the budget to surplus.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy motive, as it is articulated by the government, is that second and subsequent kids do not cost as much. That has not been my experience. As I talk to people who have had children in the recent era, it is an interesting thesis to bring forward. I am reminded that frugal and economically conservative investments in furniture for newborns tends to involve purchasing a bed that can have the base elevated to be a cot during the nano human phase of the child's development. As they move from nano human to micro human, you can lower the base of the bed and then the sides can go up and down. As they go from nano to micro to mini human, then you take the sides off the very same article: then that is a bed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That has been my experience from nano to micro to mini human. It spreads right across the birth of a second child in my household when we had to do it all again. We could not break the news to Madeline that she was going to lose her bed because of some policy idea that she had to forfeit it now that Isabella had come into this world. We had to buy the same arrangements for Isabella. When she was at that nano age, we had the base elevated and it was a nice, snug little spot. As she moved from nano to micro, we lowered the side—but we had the bits that could pull up so she did not clunk her head and fall out during the night. As she became a mini human, the sides came off and she was a big girl. But it took some years before she got a big girl's bed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That journey is also replicated in capsules and seating for cars. I do not know whether anyone in this place other than those of us who have recently been parents have looked at how biblically expensive safe seating is for motor vehicles these days, and how you are encouraged to maintain that structured and supported seating arrangement into the child's seventh year. Unless you are planning to spread the children seven years apart—and that certainly would not fly in my household—the idea that we could reuse those pieces of child rearing infrastructure, if I could use that term, is a little bit of a fiction. It is just not borne out in reality. Therefore, those stay-at-home parents are left wondering and bewildered as to why there is this reduction in the baby bonus for second and subsequent children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes at a time when cost-of-living pressures for families are very significant. Many of the families I represent in the Dunkley electorate do not have much wiggle room at the end of the month; it is a close budgeting exercise for them. My colleague and friend the member for Riverina touched on some of those cost imposts, including the carbon tax. Stay-at-home families are running their households during what is the most expensive period in which to be consuming energy—if you look at time-of-use energy consumption. Those that are not stay-at-home families—their children are in care or at school, and the household is largely vacated—are spared the peak power costs of maintaining a healthy living environment for those in the home. These families are copping the most punishing impacts of the carbon tax. Despite the concept that these families with second and subsequent children somehow have less financial pressure, I would contend that the evidence is to the contrary and there is in fact a greater degree of financial pressure. The notion that you can simply roll over child-rearing infrastructure and that that somehow represents a saving as the logic for this reduction in the baby bonus for second and subsequent children is utter nonsense. This is simply about trying to make an ugly budget position that the Labor government has steered itself and the nation into slightly less bad than it otherwise would be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the measures themselves, a couple of other things come to mind. One is that, just as proper support is needed for stay-at-home families, proper support is also needed for those who choose a different pathway. We have heard time and time again how the deficiencies in the government's paid parental leave system failed to recognise that, for households that are raising children and looking to some paid parental leave support, under the government's regime, that defaults back to a minimum wage level. The reality in households is that, when a child arrives, the bills do not default back to the minimum wage level, the mortgage does not all of a sudden default back to a minimum wage level, the financial commitments that you have made do not miraculously default back to a minimum wage level—yet that is the assumption that is embedded in the government's program. In addition to that, for primary carers, mainly women, who are seeking paid parental leave assistance during the early period of raising a new arrival in their family, the loss of superannuation and other benefits represents an ongoing financial impediment in terms of their security and retirement income possibilities—another deficiency in the government's paid parental leave scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I am pleased that the coalition has brought forward a policy for a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme that recognises that support is important for stay-at-home parents and also for those that do not choose that pathway in terms of their family arrangements. It is particularly encouraging that the coalition's policy recognises the circumstances facing small business. Women who choose to contribute to that engine room of the economy—albeit one that is spluttering a little bit under this government's policy setting—should not be disadvantaged in terms of their access to paid parental leave support. Under the coalition's policy the types of schemes that are so attractive and offered by the Public Service or major corporations all of a sudden come within reach of the small business sector of the economy and, therefore, small business is enhanced in its capacity to recruit very capable women who might otherwise not be attracted to working with small enterprises because they cannot access the more generous paid parental leave arrangements of the corporates and the public sector. That is overcome by the coalition's policy position as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in this bill are the administrative arrangements relating to dad and partner pay. How topical this is. I have tried on a number of occasions to point out to the government how mindless, senseless, unjustified and unnecessary is the government's insistence on imposing the paid parental leave pay clerk responsibilities on smaller employers in particular. We tried to maintain the system that was in place when the government's program was initially introduced, where the Family Assistance Office of Centrelink were the ones that processed those payments. Having determined eligibility against material supplied by the employer and the applicant seeking to confirm their eligibility, the government made those payments directly to those eligible people. In that window, in that nirvana, as it was described by the minister, when there were so many people welcoming the paid parental leave opportunity, the very system that was in place that gave rise to boast after boast from government ministers about the scheme, we just wanted to keep that system in place, that architecture in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But no, that was not enough. The government needed to go against its promise that it would not impose additional administrative and cost burdens on employers with the introduction of its scheme. It had to insist, under the threat of substantial fines, that smaller employers, with no business in calculating eligibility or the nature of the scheme, would have the government decide to whom and in what amount the payments would be paid and then descend those payments to those small business, under threat of a fine, to process as if they were part of the payroll system—but then have them removed from the payroll system as they related to payroll tax, superannuation contributions and workers compensation liabilities. We said: 'No, the system is in place, the infrastructure is in place. Why impose this needless burden?' What does this bill do? The bill relies on the very system we wanted to have operate across the whole paid parental leave scheme, where the secretary carries out that responsibility. No, instead the government wanted the secretary to decree that an employer—particularly a small employer—would do that work that the government was doing previously when Jenny Macklin and ministers responsible for this program were boasting about its success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a vivid contrast to Friday, 13 July 2007, when Ms Plibersek, Ms Macklin and Ms Gillard issued a joint press release promising, in respect of their paid parental leave scheme, 'Labor will not support a system that imposes additional financial burdens or administrative complexity on small businesses or in any way acts as a discouragement to the employment of women'. What did they do? They went and did the very thing that they promised not to do. When we came to try and have the provisions that are re-emphasised in this bill before the House that are now utilised for the payment of dad and partner pay, when we came to this chamber to see that those very same mechanisms be used that are embodied in this bill today, we were rejected. It was voted down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Independents, supposedly concerned about red tape and compliance burdens on small business, lost their way. In fact, Independent member Mr Oakeshott, days after voting against the very measure that would reduce red tape and compliance costs, got up in the National Press Club and said he was concerned about how small business have been:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… really whacked … around the head and this parliament will be a small business friend and help with these compliance challenges—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">these are his words, so I apologise for the length of sentence—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">as we challenge small business with important reforms, such as paid parental leave and a carbon market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say he was concerned about the compliance burden. He voted just days earlier against the very measure that would have relieved the very compliance burden he went on to speak about. Then, to add insult to injury, he did it again when we gave the government and the crossbenchers an opportunity to understand the compliance burden small business is facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have another bill relying on the very provisions that we sought to have the government use for the payment of the Paid Parental Leave scheme, particularly for smaller employers. Again, they have turned down the opportunity. They have walked away from the opportunity to reduce the red tape and compliance burden facing small business. You do not have to take my word for it. These provisions, which are now being embraced in the bill before the House, are the very same provisions we wanted used for the scheme in general and we got endorsements from so many small business organisations. I say to the government that it is not too late. You can amend this bill to embrace the red tape reduction measures that would end the compliance and red tape obligations under the threat of a fine forcing Paid Parental Leave paymaster roles on small employers unless and except where the eligible person and the employer agree. In that case, let them do it. But, otherwise, do the right thing and relieve some of the compliance burden embodied in the system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="172770" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SMYTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:01</span>):  I am pleased to be able to contribute to this evening's debate. The Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013, as has been apparent in the discussions up to now, reflects a measure announced in the 2012-13 MYEFO. It is designed to maintain the appropriate financial support for those who are having a new child while ensuring that our family assistance measures are sustainable into the future. It is very important that we contemplate that in the context of this bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of the debate this evening there has been a great deal of focus on the cost of living. Needless to say, that is borne out in the question of providing the baby bonus for new parents. But it is borne out in a range of other ways. It is rather disingenuous for members of the opposition to be coming into this place clearly articulating that they are going to slash the schoolkids bonus, a practical means by which this government has been able to respond to cost-of-living pressures upon families amongst other things, while talking about their credentials in relation to the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is particularly timely in the context of some recent events in my electorate that we have a discussion in relation to this bill on the cost of living because the Leader of the Opposition was in my electorate during the last couple of weeks and took the time to reflect on the cost of living. Regrettably, it was to a fairly small audience, a very closely held group of people. Indeed, a former Liberal Party candidate for the 2010 Victorian state election hosted the event. It was a very closely held event in Beaconsfield in my electorate. The Leader of the Opposition talked about the cost of living. It was interesting that he failed to reflect at that morning tea on the cost-of-living implications of cutting the schoolkids bonus for the some 10,300 families in my electorate, the some 18,000 children in my electorate and some 1.3 million people around Australia who stand to benefit from it. He certainly shied away from discussing that. Likewise he shied away from discussing the household assistance package that Labor has put in place. He shied away from any kind of certainty in relation to the tripling of the tax-free threshold which Labor has put in place which has certainly been to the benefit of people in my electorate. It seems that the only people who are actually concerned about families and their cost-of-living pressures are on this side of the chamber. Indeed, the only person who is threatening families, threatening to impose additional taxes and threatening to take away family assistance is the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a particularly important measure which continues to maintain the current baby bonus arrangements for a family's first child or multiple births, regardless of the birth order of their children. Under the new arrangements, the amount of the baby bonus for second and subsequent children will be somewhat reduced to $3,000 from 1 July this year. Notwithstanding that, other forms of assistance continue to be available to eligible parents through Labor's Paid Parental Leave scheme, dad and partner pay, and the family tax benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting that the previous speaker in this debate, my new neighbour, the member for Dunkley, was reflecting on the Paid Parental Leave scheme. It is extraordinary what people can come up with when they had more than a decade to implement what they say is a much more effective and business friendly paid parental leave scheme. It is very interesting that they chose not to consider a paid parental leave scheme until Labor came up with one. It is also interesting that they choose to fund their paid parental leave scheme through a tax. So when we are talking about real cost-of-living issues, practically responding to the pressures on families and ensuring that modern Australian families are provided with the financial support that they need when they have a new child in the family it is only Labor that has a practical response. It is only Labor that is capable of funding it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us will ensure a range of other things in relation to the payment of the family tax benefit and double orphan pension arrangements. The bill will ensure that families remain eligible for the family tax benefit until the end of the calendar year and their child finishes school. The qualification period for the double orphan pension is being extended so that it aligns with eligibility for the family tax benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contemplating the family tax benefit, it is important to remember that Labor has ensured that up to $110 more per child is made available in family tax benefit A and $69 per eligible family in family tax benefit B since May 2012. That means around 900,000 families are now benefiting from Labor's lifting of the childcare rebate to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses. It means that a range of practical financial measures are being made available to families right across Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly recognise the significance of those family tax benefit measures and I certainly recognise the significance of our lifting of the childcare rebate, since my electorate is home to an increasing number of young families. My electorate comprises a very significant proportion of the growth corridor of Melbourne and it is those families who stand to benefit from the practical measures that Labor is putting in place, while simultaneously ensuring that we have a sustainable family payments system into the future. It is for that reason that I am pleased to speak in relation to this bill this evening, a bill which balances the needs of families having first children and recognises the needs of those families with second and subsequent children but does so in a way which ensures that our family payments system is sustainable into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition this evening have reflected very significantly on the cost-of-living pressures which affect families across Australia. They have not, however, reflected with any great depth on their approach to the household assistance package measures which Labor has put in place during the last year. Indeed, it is worth bearing in mind in the context of the debate this evening that the opposition’s measures in relation to a clean energy future will have the effect, it is estimated by Treasury, of imposing a $1,300 impost on each household in Australia. So not only is their Direct Action Plan something which will impose rather punitive measures on households financially; they are still entirely unclear about where they stand on the household assistance package measures which have gone to support not only families but pensioners, low-income earners and a range of people right across electorates such as mine. Indeed, around 3.2 million pensioners are $172 better off for singles and about $182 better off for couples combined a fortnight as a result of Labor’s pension changes. Those pensioners should know that it is Labor that has been concerned about their cost-of-living pressures and that it is Labor that has endeavoured to ensure that they are properly supported. Again, during the more than a decade that the opposition were in office, they failed to respond practically to the needs of pensioners. They now come into this place and purport to be standing up for families facing cost-of-living pressures and for pensioners facing cost-of-living pressures but they are entirely disingenuous about those cost-of-living pressures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a particularly responsible measure that is being put in place recognising the needs of families with young children or expecting young children, at the same time recognising that we have an obligation to ensure that our family payments system is sustainable into the future. This bill makes some changes to the baby bonus to ensure support for new parents with what we all know are significant upfront costs of having a first child but it ensures that we are realistic about some of the costs which follow on for second and subsequent children. The baby bonus, under the legislation, will continue to be paid at a rate of $5,000 for a family's first child and for each child in a multiple birth or adoption. We know that these changes were flagged in the 2012-13 MYEFO, so the opposition has had a substantial opportunity to consider them, to consider how they might respond and to consider how they might best reflect on cost-of-living pressures and other pressures facing new families. Yet we are still in the dark about the kinds of arrangements they might put in place if they were to come to office to support families through the family tax benefit system, through the changes to the tax-free threshold and through the range of changes that Labor has put in place. On these matters the opposition, at best, remains silent and certainly is somewhat confused. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office Labor has acted steadfastly to support jobs throughout our economy. Indeed, we have seen almost 850,000 jobs created since coming to office. This is one of the most significant ways in which we have practically been able to support families, ensuring that they continue to have a job, ensuring that family members continue to be able to support themselves. Needless to say, during the period when we were contemplating Australia’s response to the global financial crisis, the opposition remained asleep at the wheel. They were incapable of providing a clear direction at that time. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition slept through some of the debates which Labor had to ensure that we supported an economic stimulus package for our economy. The opposition’s approach would have meant that we would have lost several hundred thousand jobs at that time and, as a consequence, many families that Labor has supported during its period in office would have found themselves without an income, without a way of supporting themselves. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time the opposition left office, the interest rate impost was substantially higher than it currently is—so much so that now families are paying around $5,000 a year less on an average mortgage of around $300,000. These are practical measures. These are significant practical circumstances which Labor has presided over and which have meant that families have not felt the pressure that they might otherwise have felt under a coalition government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has ensured that families are appropriately supported through its family payment measures. The bill before us tonight continues that. Labor has also ensured that our economic settings provide the circumstances in which employment remains a priority and employment ensures that families are appropriately supported with an income. It is with pleasure that I have been able to contribute to this evening's debate on another significant set of policy measures designed to ensure that our family payment system continues to respond to the needs of families such as those in my electorate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="83P" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms JULIE BISHOP</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:19</span>):  At the outset, I must say that the coalition has grave reservations about the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013, but, due to the disastrous budget mismanagement of this government, we do not believe that we can oppose this bill, which is principally designed to cut the level of funding for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, because this is a savings measure. However, we do condemn the government for this outcome, and I will be moving a second reading amendment which notes that the coalition, should we be elected to government, commits to reviewing the changes in this bill to establish their true budgetary and administrative impact on business, especially small and medium enterprises, who need the support of this scheme in order to grow their export oriented businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed in the bill are to implement the recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook decision to deliver annual savings of $25 million. That is how dire the budget situation has become. This government, which has run up over $260 billion in gross debt, now has to look for savings in the order of $25 million a year out of this scheme. The EMDG Scheme, administered by Austrade, partly supports the export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost exports, to grow our economy in Australian produced goods and services. Claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial year pro rata up to the cap. My understanding is that about 5,100 enterprises per year apply for grants. Prior to now, the scheme has been capped for many years at $150 million per annum, except in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when a $200 million cap applied. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the government, the changes in this bill will better help Australian exporters maximise the potential of the Asian century by increasing the number of grants available in East Asian and frontier and emerging markets from seven years worth to eight years. The government believes that this offers Australian small- and medium-sized exporters a slightly longer and more commercially realistic period to become established in these markets. However, to offset the additional grant expenditure associated with an increased number of grants to East Asian and emerging and frontier markets, the number of grants to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union is to be reduced. I believe that the 21st century should be known as 'the global century' and that Australia, as a global nation with global interests, should not only be looking to East Asia but also be continuing to pursue opportunities for our exporters in established markets. The government argues that in those markets the Australian brand is already well known and accepted and small businesses would typically face fewer barriers to doing business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for the reduction in the number of grants for these markets from a maximum of seven years of annual grants to only five years. So, in effect, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness is telling Australian exporters that he knows how to run their businesses better than they do. He knows through who knows what business experience that the US market is bad but the Asian market is good. The fact is that the minister for trade does not have a clue. If the minister for trade thought the Asian market was so vital, why did he do virtually nothing to stop the government's disgraceful ban on live cattle exports to Indonesia? The government claims that it is seeking to introduce this bill now to avoid creating considerable uncertainty for small businesses as they adjust to the new arrangements which become operational on 1 July 2013. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has consulted key stakeholder groups, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Export Council of Australia—both oppose the expenditure cut and have asked that the coalition oppose the bill. We have agonised over this decision because we agree with them that the EMDG scheme under a competent government is a fine scheme and it has helped Australian exporters over many decades, and we believe it should not be cut in this way. However, recognising the dire state of this government's upcoming budget, recognising the dire state of the debt situation that this government has plunged Australia into and in the interests of our wider budget management policy, it is felt that we cannot oppose the expenditure cuts. But we note that this is yet another blow to business caused by the budget mismanagement and fiscal recklessness of the Gillard government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When in doubt a Labor government will default to kicking the business community. The former trade union bosses and their lawyers who form the Labor Party just do not get business, especially small business. Labor cries crocodile tears about job security, but does not acknowledge or appreciate that it is the business community that is the engine room for job security—the businesses that take the risks to find new markets to grow their businesses. It is business that employs workers and creates and provides jobs. So, this blow to the EMDG scheme is just another example of Labor not understanding business and its needs. It is fair to say that since 2007 Labor has made a complete mess of the EMDG scheme. Soon after taking office Labor expanded the scheme by lowering the eligible expenditure threshold from $15,000 to $10,000, increasing the number of grants from seven to eight and increasing the maximum grant from $150,000 to $200,000—all well and good, if you can believe them. The cost of these changes was estimated at $50 million a year, but then—and this is the key—Labor increased funding only for the year 2009-10. So, in June 2010 Labor then amended the scheme to essentially reverse the 2008 implementation of its election commitments. Why should we have been surprised?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past the coalition has made commitments to increase the funding levels of the EMDG scheme. We believe it is a good scheme. While this remains a long-term goal, we believe the export sector would benefit more from a coalition government making its first priority the abolition of the carbon tax, then the mining tax, the reduction in Labor's debt and the reversal of Labor's fiscal mismanagement. In terms of the detail of the legislation, I am advised that industry representatives have various concerns about the potential exclusion of some types of activities—for example, the promotion of musical concerts. While these are a matter for debate, the bottom line is that many of these exclusions would appear to have been made because of cost cutting. The principal change that has attracted most attention is the cutting of grants available to established markets like the United States, the United Kingdom, European Union and Canada with some of the savings used to fund increased grants, principally in the East Asian region. The rest of the savings go to consolidated revenue, although we do not have a breakdown on the composition of that—so, again, another warning sign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry argues that there is no credible commercial analysis provided that shows that the EMDG money spent on established markets is any less valuable than that spent in emerging markets. I agree and the coalition agrees that it should be up to Australian business to exploit markets according to commercial realities, rather than bureaucratic whim. The minister who introduced this bill, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, has one of the worst track records of any trade minister in modern history in terms of achieving for exporters. There has barely been any progress at all in trade negotiations by this minister. He has cut the vitally important EMDG scheme. He stood by idly when the Gillard government trashed our trade relations with Indonesia over the live cattle export fiasco and trashed our reputation as a trusted and reliable trading partner. The Australia-China Free Trade Agreement has barely moved from the starting point of negotiations that occurred under the Howard government in 2005. New Zealand also started negotiations with China in the same year and concluded their free trade agreement by 2008. In particular there has been stalled progress with respect to the free trade agreement with South Korea. Again, where is the practical concern with boosting our trade with Asia, when the government cannot finalise an agreement with one of our friendliest trading partners? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Farmers Federation has been particularly vocal about this export issue. Last week, along with representatives of the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Meat Industry Council and the Australian Lot Feeders Association, the President of the National Farmers, Mr Jock Laurie, said: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian beef producers stand to miss out on $1.4 billion in exports to Korea because of our stalled free trade agreement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the threat to other agriculture exports like wheat (around $350 million) and dairy (over $100 million) was also pronounced.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further he stated that:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Total losses to Australian agriculture could run into the multi billions of dollars. Australian farmers are losing out in a major way while ever we don’t have an FTA with Korea and our major competitors like the USA do.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The beef industry provides a classic example. The National Farmers Federation notes that: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current arrangements, Australia’s $645 million annual beef trade with Korea is subject to a 40 per cent tariff.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, after signing a Korea-US FTA, United States beef is subject to only a 34.6 per cent tariff, 5.3 per cent less than Australian beef. But the differential will become massive as time goes by since US beef exports to Korea will be completely tariff free by 2026. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has publicly admitted that a key sticking point is its unilateral veto of what are called investor-state dispute settlement clauses. The Howard government used the potential inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement clause as a negotiating position for bilateral agreements and so such clauses were included in some of Australia's FTAs concluded under the Howard government, as well as in the one with ASEAN and in the free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore and Thailand. But they were not included in others—for example, the FTAs with the United States and New Zealand. Inclusion of such clauses should be considered on a case-by-case basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true to say that the Australian business community does not have a united view on the matter. However, in 2011 the Gillard government stated that they were opposed to investor-state dispute settlement clauses, despite the previous inclusion of such clauses in the Chile and ASEAN agreements finalised since 2007. In contrast, the coalition remains open, as a negotiating position, to including ISDS clauses. The fact is that the EMDG cut is just another blow in the general mismanagement of our export trade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also concerned by the extra regulatory burden which will be placed on exporters by the changes to the EMDG scheme. Should we be elected to government, we are determined to cut red tape and overregulation. This bill is just another example of this government making changes which will lead to additional red tape and regulation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:33</span>):  I support the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. Having listened to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party's arguments and her reasons for putting forward her amendment, I am not at all persuaded by them nor do I believe they are worthy of the support of this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Export Market Development Grants scheme is an Australian government financial assistance program which assists and encourages small- and medium-sized Australian businesses to develop export markets by reimbursing up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenses above $10,000, provided that the total expenses are at least $20,000. To date, the program has provided up to seven grants to each eligible applicant. To access the scheme for the first time, businesses need to have spent $20,000 over two years on eligible export marketing expenses. To be eligible, the Australian business must have income of not more than $50 million in the grant year and must have promoted the export of goods—most services also qualify—the export of intellectual property and know-how, inbound tourism or conferences and events held in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are eight key provisions of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. The first is to increase the maximum number of grants to eight. The second is to exclude expenses relating to the promotion of sales to the markets of the USA, Canada and the European Union in grant years six, seven, and eight for all applicants except approved bodies. The third key provision is to remove the limit on administrative expenditure from the legislation and introduce a power for the minister to set the limit on administrative expenditure by determination. The fourth is to prevent further approval of joint ventures after 30 June 2013. Fifthly, the provisions of the bill remove event promoters from the EMDG scheme. Sixthly, the provisions of this amendment bill prevent the payment of grants engaging an EMDG consultant who has been assessed to be not a fit and proper person. The seventh change will enable a grant to be paid more quickly where a grant is determined before the l July following the so-called 'balance distribution date'. Lastly, the bill will require applicants to acquit claims by individually paying for claimed expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's white paper, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the Asian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">entury</span>, makes very clear the importance of Asia in Australia's future and the opportunities that Asia's development in the 21st century holds for Australia. In recent years the pace of growth and change in the Asian region has been nothing short of phenomenal. According to the white paper, in the past 20 years China and India have almost tripled their share of the global economy and increased their absolute economic size six times over. By 2025, the region as a whole will account for almost half of world output.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The white paper also takes a close look at what Asia's future means for Australia and at the opportunities for us in the years ahead. As an advanced economy with expertise in so many areas, including education, construction, business, entertainment, tourism, health and the environment, Australia is extremely well placed to strengthen its ties with Asia. It is in Asia and developing countries in other parts of the world that our future markets lie and that is where Australia should focus its efforts. The government recognises that and so do Australian businesses—it is an obvious reality—and that is exactly what this legislation seeks to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Asia has a population of around four billion and it is already a market we should be tapping into much more than we have done to date. We have good links with Asia, established as a result of not only our proximity to many Asian countries but also the links that we have formed with many Asian countries—links that will hold us in good stead when we want to do more business with them in the future. These links result in two-way trade, and they are links that the Asia white paper quite properly says our future should be based on. Our future lies in Asia and the emerging countries, because the people of those countries are wanting to bring their standard of living into line with those of advanced economies. That is where the opportunities will lie. Those countries are the ones that will be wanting to tap into the expertise that already exists in Western countries and in particular the expertise that exists in friendly Western countries like Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is well understood by business in Australia. In my own electorate, I frequently speak to business people who are already doing business in Asian markets but who are looking to expand their business. On many occasions they have come to my office to seek assistance to further their business in Asian markets and in the Asian countries we have relationships with. For many small- and medium-size businesses, who do have great ideas and who see obvious opportunities in Asia, without assistance their ideas will never be put into practice. Many of the people I speak to need assistance and they come to my office to see what assistance is available from the government. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is an ideal way of providing that very assistance so that they can bring their initiatives to fruition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no doubt at all that this legislation, and the scheme more broadly, has been welcomed by the business community. Those who say that it is wrong for us to cut back the focus on the USA, Canada and Europe are short-sighted. The reality is that business in Australia today has limited opportunities in those places, for many reasons and not the least of which is that those countries do not require the kinds of services that I alluded to earlier to the same extent as the emerging markets do—and those emerging markets are best located for us in the Asian area, as well as other places in the world where developing countries are looking to prosper. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments contained in this legislation ensure that the Australian people—Australian businesses—get the best return for the public funds provided by the government under this program. The Australian people will get the best returns because the best return for their funds is gained by focusing on the emerging opportunities in the Asian market. As I said a moment ago, this focus will benefit the very businesses that are seeking to access those funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My understanding is that there will be a saving of about $25 million per annum as a result of these changes. Frankly, the government is responsible for the expenditure of public funds and it ought to use those funds prudently. If we can manage funds better and still support business, then quite frankly we should be doing so. Reviewing legislation such as this on a regular basis is simply part of being a prudent government. I understand that in 2012-13 over 3,000 claims have been made under this scheme, and I understand that about $125.4 million has been allocated in the current budget. Those are not insignificant amounts of money, and those funds will assist Australian businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In more recent weeks I have spoken with businesses in my electorate who have brilliant ideas—in some cases they are brilliant inventions—and they are simply seeking some support and assistance to get those ideas and inventions out to the wider market. These are inventions that will be embraced and adopted particularly in those countries that we refer to as the emerging or developing countries. Yet, these businesses are quite often restrained by a lack of financial support. This program is the kind of program that provides them with the right sorts of support and certainly it is the kind of program that will enable them to send their ideas offshore. The people offshore also benefit because they are the beneficiaries of intellectual property, knowhow or whatever it is that is brought to them as a result of someone's idea here in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in her remarks alleged that these amendments mean more red tape. As I said earlier on, it is incumbent on any government to ensure that public funds are spent wisely, it is incumbent on any government to ensure that no-one rorts the system and it is incumbent on any government to ensure that taxpayers get the best possible value for their dollars. Cutting out people like promoters—promoters of entertainment events; concerts and the like—is quite reasonable. Promoters are not, in my view, the beneficiaries for which this fund was set up. As a result of promotional activity you might get some economic benefit through the impact on tourism and the like, but, frankly, I believe there are much more worthy and much more deserving areas where these grants should be applied, and the decision by the government to tighten the rules in respect of some of those matters is quite appropriate. I commend the legislation to the House. </span>

                    <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:45</span>):  I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for trade, the member for Curtin, to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013. It has long been said that Australia is an exporting nation, and this has never been more obvious than in Western Australia. According to state government figures, Western Australia contributed $122 billion of Australia's merchandise exports in 2011-12, a rise of five per cent on the previous year. This equates to 46 per cent of this nation's exports, which exceeds the combined contribution of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. So it is a significant export effort. Trade accounts for 53 per cent of Western Australian's gross state product, with the great majority, over 90 per cent, coming from the mining sector. However, the state is also a major agricultural exporter. In 2010-11, Western Australia produced over $6 billion of agricultural, fisheries and forestry merchandise, and, of this, $5 billion worth was exported. The vast majority of these products are going to Asia, due to Western Australia's natural geographical competitive advantage—its proximity to those Asian markets. With these key figures in mind, it must be obvious even to the most parochial eastern state members in this House that Western Australia is in fact an export powerhouse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason also that export assistance needs to have a Western Australian focus and create further opportunities. It is easy to be fooled into thinking that the west has only large multinational mining companies which are readily able to do their own marketing. Indeed, it might seem that our mining companies actually sell themselves—I know that some on the other side think this. There are, however, many smaller players, in a range of industries, that certainly deserve the support of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The south-west of Western Australia, in particular, is an area of innovation and industry. Whilst we have a number of those same large exporters, such as Worsley Alumina, we also have a broad range and a large number of small suppliers exporting a wide variety of products. As I know well, the south-west, with a $16.8 billion regional economy of its own, is an economic engine room for the whole nation. The region derives most of its wealth from the mining and manufacturing sectors, which, latest figures show, produce $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion respectively. It is also a major exporter of agricultural products, as I said, from beef and dairy—some of the best dairy products in the world—to the finest of Margaret River and Geographe region wines. Some of these have found niche markets for their high-quality products, and it is this group that needs and deserves support. They are out there doing the hard yards. They are small businesses, frequently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the explanatory memorandum to this bill tells us in the outline that the bill 'helps achieve savings of $25 million per year'. However, the explanatory memorandum also notes, under 'Financial Impact':</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Expenditure under the Act is set through annual Appropriation acts. A capping mechanism ensures that expenditure under the scheme is limited to the amount appropriated.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are conflicting statements. That really tells us, the readers, that the government has once again engaged in what you could only call a surreptitious slashing of funds—and this time it is actually of industry support to those same small businesses that are seeking an export opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was acknowledged at Senate estimates, this is another attempt by the Gillard government to hide the real budget position it will face in May. It is duplicitous of the government to attempt to hide this slashing of funding and to sanitise the explanatory memorandum. This bill is not about enhancing exports. It is not. It is about saving the government dollars at the expense of those same very innovative and keen Australian exporters that just need a bit of a hand along the way. This is at a time when the world remains almost on the edge of an economic precipice and when the value of the Australian dollar is crucifying Australian exporters. It is tough out there, and I do not know what the Australian government expects. If you are an exporter, it is a tough market. If you are an agricultural exporter, it is an even tougher market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw some recent forecasts about the future of agriculture and agricultural exports, and they predicted even tougher times than we have now. I am concerned, as you would be, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, for the future of a lot of those exporters and the growers that supply them. I also noticed last week the economic forecasting by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences that indicated the Australian dollar is expected to stay at current levels—a particularly high level of at least US104c—and not return to parity until 2018. If that is not a great example of the pressure that Australian agricultural exporters are under, I do not know what is. Everyone in this House needs to think again, including the government, because, if this scenario proves to be accurate, the export sector in Australia is in for very rough times until 2018. The ability of both Europe and the US to survive their respective impending debt disasters will also have long-term impacts on the value of the exchange rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there are optimistic economists demonstrating perhaps a bit of hubris at the moderate improvement in budget deficits in both of those areas, but the realist economists still recognise that those budgets are not actually in surplus but just a little bit less in deficit. This is the reality, and that tells us that the Australian dollar is not likely to weaken anytime soon. It is also a reality that this global generation generally continues to almost binge on debt. Those on the other side do the same thing. We heard today, in the debate on the MPI, about the government's $300 billion debt—the debt ceiling. Let us wait and see what is in the next budget. Government spending is increasing the burden on the next generation—spending today is taxing tomorrow. This government is leaving debt and deficit for the next generation. The next generation in Europe and the US will have to pay off the debts of their parents or simply pass them on with their own added debt to some future generation to take care of. In this parliament there has also been a passing on of intergenerational debt, perhaps for the first time in this nation's history. That is an indictment of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian exporters may recover if the US dollar improves, but there is another element of the export debate that needs to be addressed here in the House today. It is the failure of the government, through Austrade, to adequately enhance the export capacity and opportunity of Australian manufacturers and producers. It should be core business for Austrade to help our small businesses into the markets. Austrade has a number of workers both domestically and overseas who are struggling with poor resourcing—and poor leadership, in some senses. The bill before the House does not improve this situation; it makes it worse. Another $25 million cut from services currently provided is part of the government's death by 1,000 cuts of export innovation, and it is death particularly to small exporters. I—like, I would bet, just about every member in this House—have had such exporters at my door saying: 'All we need is a hand. We need to get into these markets, but we are a relatively small business and we are doing it tough on the ground.' I think it entirely escapes this government how tough it is on the ground, particularly for food manufacturers and exporters and even more particularly for those in the agricultural sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Austrade appears to be too bogged down covering for the government's incompetence to do its own job properly. It might surprise the Prime Minister and the trade minister to learn that the role of Austrade is to promote Australian exports, not to promote the Prime Minister and the minister for trade. Austrade needs to promote small to medium enterprises—and even some of the bigger enterprises—not only in my electorate but also around Australia. Such businesses are investing their own money and their own expertise, and they are working overtime not just for themselves but also for their communities, for the regions and for our economy. They are alive and well in our part of the world but are doing it exceptionally tough, and often all they need is a small hand up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A refocusing of Austrade is really urgent and essential so that our own exporters, rather than this government, can become the main agenda again. Austrade should be focused on our small to medium exporters who are out there wanting to get into the markets and provide some fabulous niche products. This refocusing is so urgent and essential because of the difficult economic times in which Austrade is operating. Austrade's job has got far harder since 2008. Things are also harder for our exporters, and we should all acknowledge how much harder they have got. The difficult economic times make it all the more important for our businesses to work smarter and to invest more wisely, and to do so some of them need assistance. Now is not the time to hang our exporters out to dry. Look at the terms of trade, look at what is happening on the ground, look how hard exporters are working and look how hard it is now that we do not have the numbers of tourists that we used to have coming to our part of the world. That is why it is important for Australian businesses to have access to export markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government is hanging exporters out to dry. It will probably take the election of a coalition government to end the rot and develop a focus on exports to assist small to medium enterprises and some of the bigger businesses. A coalition government will seek to look after the interests of exporters and innovators. We need to celebrate and support what they are doing, not celebrate and support the failing government we have here. The coalition will work for enhanced access for Australian businesses to world markets. We in the coalition understand very directly the importance of doing this work. If we are elected, we will do this work in conjunction with the private sector, and the private sector will also focus, I have no doubt, on marketing and market access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some sectors, both sides of the public-private partnership have abandoned the field. Both need to re-engage, and we in this place need to be part of the re-engagement. Nowhere will re-engagement be more important than in the agricultural sector. When you get out into the wheat belt in Western Australia, you see how tough farmers are doing it. There are the same challenges in my electorate. Right across Australia I see the same challenges. Farmers are finding it extremely difficult to remain viable. It is a huge challenge, as is the challenge of keeping enough young farmers coming through who have the knowledge, expertise and passion to continue doing what our farmers do so well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to know what the Asian market is looking for. We know that we can produce the best quality food products in the world—we are good at it—but we also need to make sure that we have the capacity to deliver what established and emerging Asian markets are looking for. A coalition government would make sure that it sufficiently developed and supported access to these markets for Australian exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has repeatedly failed farmers in Australia. This fact is as tangible as it could be. One of the main examples of the government's failure would have to be its actions on the live export trade. The impacts of the government's actions are being felt all up and down the chain in each state—and certainly in my electorate in south-west Western Australia. The impacts of the government's actions are major, even though the government chooses to ignore them. If you want to talk about impacts on exports, just look at the live cattle export debacle. It is just one example of how this government has failed farmers in Australia. It has also failed our food producers and food manufacturers. Australian farmers are certainly capable of delivering the products that the market not only demands but also deserves. Now is not the time to abandon Australian farmers.</span>

                    <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:59</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you come from Maranoa and know how important the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 is to you. I am interested that the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is at the table, along with the former Speaker, the member for Scullin. I also note that the member for McEwen, who is another regional member, is sitting in the chamber, listening intently to my words. I also acknowledge the member for Wright, as well as the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional health, who is also sitting at the table. He was in Wagga Wagga just last week and would have no doubt heard many farmers complaining about how difficult the terms of trade are for them at the moment. It is always wonderful to follow the member for Forrest, Nola Marino, because she is so passionate and feisty about all of these important issues, which are central to trade. I know that the members in the House at the moment all appreciate just how important trade, agriculture and Australia's future food security are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note how few Labor speakers are on the speakers list. That is a shame, because perhaps if we were talking about unions or public servants at risk of losing their jobs—one of those sorts of issues—the speakers list would be full. It is just a shame that the speakers list is not full with government members talking about this very important issue, because we have just heard the member for Forrest talking about just how hard and how tough our agriculture producers are doing it at the moment. The shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Calare, told us yesterday in our party room that producers are doing it tougher in some circumstances than they were at the height of the drought—and that is a problem. And it is not just a problem for them; it is a problem for the regional communities that their hard work underpins. It is a problem for our nation because we cannot sell the amount of food that we rely on to help our balance of payments figures, our balance of trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot continue to operate this way. Those farmers, let us face it, were once the backbone of this economy, and they still keep it going. Agriculture is still such an important component. Mining may well be one of the big dollar earners, but agriculture helps our balance of payments no end, and we all like to eat food. Only last week I spoke to representatives from the Leeton citrus growers. This organisation has been going since 1942. They are doing it really tough at the moment. They have lost 150 growers in less than a decade. That is the loss of 300 wages. Their costs are now going through the roof. Their power costs are exorbitant and are not helped by the carbon tax. Their wages have not become any cheaper. The high Australian dollar is really killing them, as well as so many other agriculture producers. Bad water policy is just another thing which they are trying to contend with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member for Wills is now the Parliamentary Secretary for Trade and has been since 4 February 2013. It is an interesting position which the member for Wills finds himself in, given the fact that he was so stridently opposed to the live cattle export trade to Indonesia when that particular issue blew up after a <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program. It was policy from this government based on a television program. It was a very savage knee-jerk reaction to a television program that saw the live cattle trade stop forthwith—bang—just like that, with no thought given to the cattle producers of Australia's west or north. Indeed, as the member for Forrest just indicated, the shock waves reverberated right throughout the cattle-producing industry and even beyond it. The markets in Wagga Wagga and elsewhere in the Riverina were affected because of it. There was a fear that they would not be able to export a lot of their cattle overseas and they would see them brought south. The people who built stock crates were also affected because orders were stopped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to say that the shadow minister for agriculture visited Indonesia last October, along with the opposition leader and the shadow foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, who has an intense interest in trade and certainly in helping our trading neighbours. The highlights of that trip were the sheer untapped potential, the member for Calare said, for our farm exports—and not just those of Northern Australia. The coalition took the extraordinary step of sending a delegation of senior shadow ministers to Indonesia because of the importance that this side of politics places on our northern neighbour as a valued trading partner—not somebody to whom we can just say, 'No more cattle.' They are not somebody whom we can just bring the gate down upon with our live exports but rather somebody whom we need to be friends with, somebody who is important to us, somebody whom we need to treat like a friend. You do not treat friends in the way that the Prime Minister did when she stopped the live cattle trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indonesia has been vastly undervalued as a trading partner. While every nation across the globe is trying to capitalise on the Asian boom, there are a number of obvious reasons why Australia should be trying to make the most of the opportunities that exist within the Indonesian economy. Indonesia is not in great need of our coal because it has large deposits of its own, and some people foolishly dismiss Indonesia as a trading opportunity because of this. Australia has a unique opportunity to bolster our farm sector with Indonesia. It has 237 million people literally on our doorstep. It has a booming middle class of around 50 million strong and a high propensity for consumer spending. In short, it is an ideal destination for our farm produce. Our farm produce, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the member for Maranoa, is the best in the world bar none. I do not mind saying that. I am sure the parliamentary secretary for agriculture, who is sitting at the table, would agree with me.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 are to deliver on the recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook decision to concentrate the Export Market Development Grants Scheme more on small businesses exporting to East Asian and frontier and emerging markets. The MYEFO decision and associated policy changes in this proposal will deliver annual savings of $25 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor calls them savings. They really are cuts and taxes. Failed policy is what it really is, and it is having an effect in this particular instance on our trading relations. This is not the first time I have spoken today; I have spoken a number of times, and a number of times I have spoken about particular bills as being cost savings—as in the baby bonus, on which I spoke earlier this evening. Again, these are to try to help the Treasurer, our failed Treasurer, to try to balance his books. And it is not working. The Australian public are not fools; they are not buying it. The fact is that this government cannot properly fiscally manage our economy. And so many people I speak to cannot wait for the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EMDG Scheme, administered by Austrade, partially supports export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost exports of Australian-produced goods and services, which are, as I say, so important for our balance-of-trade figures. The EMDG Scheme reimburses up to half of eligible export promotion expenses incurred by small- to medium-sized enterprises, and then the claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial year pro rata up to the particular cap. Around 5,100 enterprises per year apply for these grants. Prior to now, the scheme has been capped at $150 million per year since 1997, except in 2008-09 and 2009-10, when a $200 million cap applied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The MYEFO decision late last year and associated policy changes in this bill are designed to deliver annual savings—again, that word 'savings'—of $25 million. According to Labor, the changes will better help Australian exporters maximise the potential of the Asian century by increasing the number of grants available in East Asian and frontier and emerging markets from seven years' worth to eight years. We all know that this is not right; this is just typical Labor spin—typical Labor claptrap. This is more policy on the run. We cannot afford, as the member for Forrest indicated, to hurt our exporters—particularly at this time, when our balance-of-trade figures are not that good, and particularly at a time when our budget is so much in the red.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To offset the additional grant expenditure associated with an enlarged number of grants to East Asian and frontier and emerging markets, the number of grants to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union are to be reduced. The government argues that in those markets the Australian brand is already well known and accepted, and small businesses typically face fewer barriers to doing business—and that may be so. But, even though the Australian brand may well be known, why not promote it even more? Why is it necessary to keep cutting, to keep cost-shifting, to try to balance the Treasurer's failed books? And why is it that all the time the ones who are getting hit in the neck the most are Australian farmers, Australian exporters—the people who put food on our plates and on the plates of so many foreigners as well?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government argues that the increased focus of the EMDG Scheme on emerging and frontier markets brings the EMDGS into closer alignment with Austrade's broader trade priorities following its review in 2011 and the government's Asian century policy agenda. I will just repeat that: 'Australia's broader trade priorities'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to what our trade priorities are or should be: the Prime Minister only last year, in quite a groundbreaking speech, actually, in Melbourne, talked about promoting and strengthening irrigation so that we could grow more food to tap into those Asian markets, but every single policy initiative by her side of government, the government that she leads, does just the opposite. I cannot understand it, nor can the citrus growers and cattle producers, nor can those wonderful lamb producers in the Riverina, who grow the best lamb in the entire nation. They cannot understand it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They simply cannot understand why this government is doing everything in its power to just stymie them whenever they try to develop export markets, to stymie them whenever they try to have the ability to grow more food to feed our nation and others. It is hurting our balance-of-trade figures. It is hurting our ability to do business in export markets such as Indonesia. And it is hurting our farmers' and agricultural producers' ability to make a profit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, when the farming sector is doing it tough, regional towns are doing it tough. You do not have to go too far into my electorate to see how tough they are doing it. Farmers are having to work at two jobs—they are having to source off-farm incomes—simply because there has been bad water policy enacted by this parliament. This government is just so bogged down in green tape. I know there has been a divorce between Labor and the Greens, but still they seem to be in cahoots with one another when it comes to policy, because so much of the policy that we see from that side of government is bogged down in green tape and so often we hear the Greens leader, Senator Milne, make the catchcry and Labor just follow suit. Their policies just follow suit, and it has to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has to stop because our farmers are the world's best. Our farmers are not asking for a handout; they are just asking for a hand up, a bit of assistance, a bit of an even go, a bit of a level playing field—something that I am sure that the parliamentary secretary for agriculture knows also. I know he has offered to come to my electorate, and I will welcome him soon to come and see for himself and to talk to the sorts of people whom I talk to, because I know he would be interested. I serve on the Standing Committee on Regional Australia, and I know the good work that he did there as the deputy chair. I know he certainly has his heart in the right place. I would certainly welcome him to come to the Riverina to hear firsthand from people. This piece of legislation is not good, and it will hurt our exporters. They are extremely valuable people. I will certainly welcome the member for Braddon to come to my part of the world, hear the sorts of complaints people have and hear of the sorts of ways forward they believe we should be adopting and the sorts of policy initiatives that his government could also be implementing to help them to make ends meet and to help them not just to survive but indeed to thrive as they should. Thank you for allowing me to make those comments, Mr Deputy Speaker.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:14</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2013 and also to support the amendments moved by the deputy leader and member for Curtin. Just by way of background, the export market development grants scheme is administered by Austrade and it partly supports export promotion expenses of eligible enterprises in order to boost the exports of Australian produced goods and services. It is a scheme that reimburses up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenditure incurred by small- and medium-sized enterprises. Claims are reimbursed retrospectively for expenditure incurred in the previous financial years, pro rata, up to the cap. Around 5,100 firms applied for grants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The basic provisions of this bill—and what it actually does—exclude expenses of export promotion for grant years six, seven and eight for the major markets of the USA, Canada and the European Union. It makes a tokenistic adjustment by increasing the number of grants by one year—just one year against eight—to countries of East Asia. First and foremost, this bill is simply confirmation of yet another broken promise by this Labor government. We can add this one to the long, long list of broken promises by this government. It is just another reason why the public no longer believes a word that they say and why the public has lost complete trust in anything that comes out of the mouth of any member of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will go back to 2007: this Labor government, then in opposition, promised hand on heart that they would increase—that is right: increase—funding for the export market development scheme. They told us how they understood this scheme, how it was vital for small business and how they were really going out there to help small business with their exports. In the last year of the Howard government, 2006-07, the export market development scheme was funded to the tune of $154.4 million—it was $154.4 million back in 2006-07. Come to this financial year, and we have a government that told us they would increase funding. They have not only been too lousy to maintain real expenditure, they have actually slashed the expenditure by $25 million. So this financial year, the expenditure is down to just $125 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the lowest amount of expenditure under this scheme for over two decades. It simply shows that Labor cannot be trusted with their promises, but not only that: whatever they promise, we see them doing the exact opposite. We saw them promise, 'No carbon tax.' We not only ended up with a carbon tax, but we ended up with the largest carbon tax in the world. They promised to stop the boats and we have ended up with an absolute explosion of boat arrivals. They promised to return the budget to surplus, but we just get larger and larger deficits. Here we had them promising to increase expenditure for the export market developments and what do we see? It is being slashed—slashed to the lowest levels in decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not only that, it is the hypocrisy that we have had from this government. On this bill, we have had one measly speaker from the government. I see the member for McEwan over there. Perhaps he is going to stand up and make a contribution to this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CRAIG KELLY:</span>
                    </a>  I think he is perhaps too embarrassed to walk around the exporters in his electorate and have to tell them that his government is cutting the funding for export development grants. What we have seen is not only the hypocrisy, it is the spin. They do not come in here and just be truthful, and say: 'Look, we have stuffed things up. We have wasted billions of dollars and we have to make some cuts.' Instead of saying that, what we get is this spin with the bill being dressed up as somehow tied to promotion in the Asian Century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As ACCI have argued, there is no credible commercial analysis that shows export development grant money spent in the USA, Canada or the EU is any less valuable than that spent in East Asia, Africa or South America. It should be up to our Australian businesses to decide where they should spend their export marketing dollar, but those decisions are now going to be distorted by this government. It is not based on good policy or sound logic, but simply on spin. I would say, however, that there is perhaps one area in the world in which we as a nation need to increase our export marketing expenditure; that is Indonesia, following the debacle of this government's cut to the live cattle exports. Overnight, without any warning at all, they simply cut off the supply of live cattle to Indonesia. That has done almost irreparable damage to our relationship with Indonesia. If we are looking to increase our export marketing expenditure, Indonesia is perhaps one of the first places where we should start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is this spin, bad policy and broken promises: it is simply bad economics. Austrade undertook a study about the benefits of such schemes. They found that firms benefiting from export market development grants spent more on export promotion than did other exporters. In fact, they estimated that the grants payment of $156 million resulted in those exporters spending an additional $147 million on marketing. What they estimated is that that extra marketing expenditure resulted in an extra $1.4 billion of export sales. For $156 million worth of expenditure under this scheme, we were able to achieve as a nation an increase in our export sales of $1.4 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is actually better than that because, you have to remember, the grants are taxable. When you look at the net cost after the tax subsidy comes back, you are looking at a much greater multiplier. Austrade worked out that, in most industries, a mature exporter will generate in additional exports 15 to 25 times the grants paid to them. If we want to increase the revenue of this nation—if we are looking at how we are going to pay back this mob's debt, how we are going to fund the NDIS, how we are going to fund the extra expenditure for schools and how we are going to fund the extra expenditure for hospitals—we should be increasing the expenditure under this scheme, not cutting it back to record lows as this government is doing. This mob simply does not get it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, we should be out there trying to create a culture of exporting and exporters. I know from my own experience. Before entering parliament, I had travelled and exhibited at trade shows in Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai. One thing I found at those trade shows was how generous other countries are, compared to Australia, and how small our scheme is. At these trade shows we were able to find out that, rather than being given 50 per cent of their expenditure by their government as Australian firms were, the companies from the UK that we were competing against were getting the whole lot subsidised by their government. So the scheme we have is very modest to start with, and this mob is just cutting it back again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also kicking exporters when they are down. Australian exporters are currently struggling with the high level of the dollar. And they were promised a tax cut by this government, funded by the mining tax. We know where that has gone.</span>
                </p>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CRAIG KELLY:</span>
                    </a>  You have not got any money for it; that is the reason. You have not got any money to fund it; you have wasted it all. It was a concocted mining tax. You blokes were played off the break. It was a complete embarrassment to your lot. So not only were our exporters promised a company tax which has not eventuated but many of them are facing downturns in our export markets. And they are also struggling with the world's largest carbon tax. Under this Labor government, energy costs for Australian firms have risen faster than just about anywhere else in the world. This is putting Australian industry, and our exporters, at a competitive disadvantage. This is the very worst time to be cutting back their funding—and that is exactly what this government is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to ask ourselves: why are they doing this? Why are they cutting back? Why are they slicing back money for export market development? It is because of their waste and mismanagement. This mob has run up the four largest deficits in our nation's history. To spin their way out of it they came up with the line 'returning the budget to surplus'. And one of the cuts they came up with was to cut back this very important scheme which we need to keep our economy going—a measly $25 million. It is interesting to see what industry experts say about these cuts. Warren Cross, a legal expert and director of a firm called Export Incentives, is quoted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Smart Company </span>magazine as saying, 'It's frustrating and disappointing this scheme has been put on the chopping block again by Labor,' and he argues that the trade minister, Dr Emerson, 'does not have a clue'. I could not agree more. He also says of our trade minister: 'He has never been interested in the scheme from day one, so this isn't a surprise. They've been cutting this grant back for years.' That just about says it all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we should look at the important amendments moved by our deputy leader. Those amendments clearly denote the problems with this bill. We need to have another review of this scheme and, if the funding is available, we need to try and help develop our culture of exporting. The coalition in the past has funded this scheme at far greater levels than what the current government are doing. When the coalition government left office we had $150 million in the scheme. The current government are reducing that to $25 million. Again, that is the complete opposite of what they promised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are going to move our country forward, if we are going to start paying the debt, a debt that we have to pay back, with interest, it is going to cost this nation $267 million a week, every week of the year, for the next 20 years. That is the funding that we have to find. We are looking at trying to find $8 billion to $10 million to fund the NDIS, which this mob on the other side loves to talk about but does not have a clue how we are going to fund. And we talk about the Gonski education reforms. To fund these things, we have to encourage exporters, we have to get our exporters out there. We make great products in Australia. That is the reason this scheme works. We want the government to encourage firms to get out there and get involved in exporting. We should not be cutting this scheme back. To cut the number of years back for the USA, for Canada and for the EU is completely the wrong direction. We should be looking at uncapping years. You cannot have just five years for marketing a product overseas. And we have to remember that these grants are not given per product, they are given per firm. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:30</span>):  I rise to speak about the circus that visited Western Sydney last week on behalf of the Prime Minister and the Australian Labor Party. Indeed, we had seen the show in Western Sydney before at the last election when at Rooty Hill the Prime Minister promised a series of things for Western Sydney that failed to be delivered in her term of office after she was elected. The Prime Minister promised to consult on climate change—remember the people's panel? She instead delivered a carbon tax. But more specifically the Prime Minister promised to give $2.1 billion for a transport link in Western Sydney—the Epping to Parramatta rail link. Now she has announced just this week that half of that money will be ripped away and there will be no Parramatta-Epping rail link.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time that we have had rail line politics played by a federal or state Labor government in New South Wales. In fact, residents in Western Sydney have for 15 years put up with rail line politics from Labor governments. Not only was the north-west rail line promised four or five times in my electorate and then eventually scrapped; the Parramatta to Epping line was also promised by the Carr Labor government. It was promised and promised and then scrapped. It makes you wonder what the member for Parramatta, who has been in this place since 2004, has been doing to obtain the Parramatta to Epping rail line. Promise after promise, election after election, time after time they have been talking about it. I remember these promises and these talks happening over a decade. Now we have had the Prime Minister tell the people of Western Sydney that half of that money is going to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not stop there. The Prime Minister promised to build an NBN over two years later. I have spoken to many of the business parks across Western Sydney—the places where the NBN would be most effective. Don't you think that if you were building an NBN to provide speeds through fibre to the premises hundreds of times faster than you would start with the businesses and business parks in Western Sydney that could provide the most productive increases for the economy? Of course you would. That is exactly why this government and this Prime Minister have failed to connect the main business parks in Western Sydney. In fact, they have been wastefully sending it to marginal seats and various homes in those marginal seats in a desperate attempt to turn around their political fortunes but ignoring the very hub of the economy—business. If you do not connect businesses such as the business parks in Western Sydney, what real benefit are you getting out of the NBN?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It continued in the last seven days. It is interesting to contrast the approaches of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. We did not just turn up to Western Sydney in the last seven days. The Leader of the Opposition has indeed visited Western Sydney over 51 times since the last election. He has been meeting with real people. I am happy to say that I can walk down any street in the electorates of Lindsay, Parramatta and Greenway—anywhere in Western Sydney—with the Leader of the Opposition at any time and any day of the week. I do not think the Prime Minister could do the same. It is not because of this culture of politics that we are hearing about; it is because of decisions the Prime Minister has taken, like the promises to build rail lines that never come to fruition. They have been copying Liberal Party policy and the not promise but commitment to fund and help the O'Farrell government build the WestConnex. Not only is it a commitment; it will be delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last week we saw the shameless attempt of this government to copy the policy. They are bereft of ideas. The desperate and damned over there have decided that all they have left to do is copy Liberal Party policy and take the funding from the promises they made last election that they have not delivered. It is pretty pathetic, and the people in Western Sydney see right through it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure is a key priority in Western Sydney, and it was the Howard government who built the last significant infrastructure, funded from a federal level, in the M7—a fantastic motorway that has provided a great benefit and an economic boost to Western Sydney. It will be the next Liberal government, whenever that is, that will deliver the WestConnex motorway, a vital piece of infrastructure for people in Western Sydney. It certainly will not be the Prime Minister and this Labor government, who have promised and promised it. Members in Western Sydney, whether they be the member for Lindsay, the member for Chifley, the member for Parramatta or the member for Greenway, ought really to stand up to this Prime Minister and cabinet and tell them that they do not want any more false promises or false dawns for the people of Western Sydney. They need to provide real commitments and real delivery and not this circus of stunts that we saw in the last seven days. The people of Western Sydney are like all the hardworking people in the outer suburbs all around this country and they can see through desperate attempts to pull the wool over their eyes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="4T4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MELHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:34</span>):  Last week I was pleased to host the Prime Minister in the electorate of Banks and to observe the warmth with which she was received. On Wednesday, 6 March, I met up with the Prime Minister, together with the Attorney-General, the Minister for Home Affairs and the member for Watson, in Punchbowl. There, the Prime Minister chaired a community forum with representatives from Neighbourhood Watch, the Canterbury, Hurstville and Bankstown council crime committees, a local drug action team and representatives from Riverwood Community Centre in my electorate. The participants at the forum engaged with the Prime Minister, together with the other ministers, on matters to do with community safety. I noted a high level of participation and involvement as local issues were discussed in an open and constructive manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the forum and prior to a press conference, I took the opportunity to introduce the Prime Minister to the group next to the room we were meeting in. This was a regular community meeting of seniors from the Chinese community who meet each week to socialise through dancing and other activities. The group was thrilled when the Prime Minister stopped by to say hello.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the formal event, the Prime Minister accompanied me to the Riverwood Community Centre. I have spoken on the success of this centre in this place in the past. The organisation is the heart of the Riverwood community in my electorate and I was delighted to be able to take the Prime Minister on a brief tour with Ms Pauline Gallagher, the centre's manager. I am very proud of the centre and was very pleased to introduce the Prime Minister to the Riverwood community, as a whole, through its community centre. With Ms Gallagher, I introduced the PM to a frail and aged group, the childcare centre and several of the culturally and linguistically diverse groups which also meet there on a regular basis. On that day, a Vietnamese group were preparing for the centre's autumn fair which was held last weekend. I later got to try their 'trial' spring rolls. The Prime Minister spent some time meeting with representatives of the staff and volunteers. There is a staff of over 100, both full time and part time, who work with almost 140 volunteers. They speak over 20 languages between them, catering for the diversity of the Riverwood community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it happened, I visited the centre again the next day with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Brendan O'Connor. Staff had already printed photos of the Prime Minister's visit and were very excited to have met her. That excitement was palpable even the next day. Minister O'Connor was able to see firsthand the commitment and dedication of those who operate the centre and those who participate in its activities. These are many of our more recent citizens giving wholeheartedly to their new community. I note particularly the involvement and the contribution of Ms Annie Organ, the current President of the Management Committee. The Prime Minister was impressed by the commitment of the staff and volunteers and pleased when she saw the numbers of people participating in the many activities at Riverwood. People feel at home there. The Prime Minister was a welcome guest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I hosted the Prime Minister at the Georges River College Penshurst Girls Campus. She was accompanied by the member for Kingsford Smith, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, to do an education forum which was broadcast live on I think both Sky and ABC 24. Over 100 teachers and principals throughout the area, together with parents and staff, attended that community forum, where there was interaction and feedback. Even to this day I am still getting positive feedback from parents, teachers and principals who participated as to how impressed they were with both Minister Garrett and the Prime Minister and the way they conducted themselves in what was a positive forum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the ways in which we should conduct our business—in a positive fashion. The Liberal Party, the National Party and the Independents are entitled to articulate their cases in a positive sense in a broader community. I do not want to see this country go down the American path in relation to the way the Republicans and the Democrats treat themselves and how they have debased politics in America. It is the politics of vitriol. I note that the member at the table had some positive comments to make this morning, and he is to be congratulated. We need to respect our culture and our institutions. We need to respect each other and conduct ourselves in a more dignified way. That is why I enjoyed the visit of the Prime Minister last week. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230886" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:40</span>):  I rise to speak in tonight's adjournment debate on coeliac disease and Coeliac Awareness Week, which is held annually from 13 to 20 March. The aim during this time is to raise awareness of the disease, with particular emphasis on its symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Each year there is a theme for Coeliac Awareness Week, and this year the theme is: 'Are you sick and tired of feeling sick and tired?' That is certainly a theme that many people who have been diagnosed with coeliac disease can relate to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coeliac disease is a hereditary disease where the immune system reacts abnormally to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, rye and oats. It is estimated that one in every 100 people is affected by coeliac disease, so based on Australia's current population there are probably around 230,000 sufferers in our country alone. However, 80 per cent of coeliacs are undiagnosed. So there are probably about 180,000 people walking around not knowing that they have coeliac disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of reasons that coeliac disease is undiagnosed, including that it is not always easy to diagnose. There are a number of tests—or purported tests—that are used, some with varying reliability, and I will speak more about the testing shortly. Diagnosis is often difficult because the symptoms can be vague and sometimes people have no symptoms whatsoever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A website, www.sickandtired.com.au, has been set up specifically for the current campaign. That certainly has a lot of information about coeliac disease, as does the Coeliac Australia website, www.coeliac.org.au. The information is wide ranging and diverse and covers a number of issues, including the symptoms of the disease. I will go through some of those now, bearing in mind that I am not medically trained, but the lists in the websites are quite extensive. There are gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, cramping, bloating and abdominal pain. Other symptoms include tiredness, irritability or feeling 'out of sorts'; bone and joint pain; delayed growth in children; iron deficiency anaemia and/or other vitamin and mineral deficiencies; osteoporosis; autoimmune disease, with autoimmune conditions commonly occurring together; weight loss, although some people may gain weight; infertility; and a family history of coeliac disease. It is fairly obvious why, when you consider the wide range of symptoms and the possibility that there are no symptoms, the disease is underdiagnosed, but this needs to change. Proper diagnosis excludes other serious illnesses and that is clearly important, but proper diagnosis and implementation of a gluten-free diet—which is the treatment for coeliac disease—is life changing for many people who have been diagnosed with the disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the websites that I referred to earlier—sickandtired.com.au—has a number of stories of those who have been diagnosed with coeliac disease and have made the subsequent transition to a gluten-free diet. Some of the comments from those with coeliac disease include: 'Felt sick and/or tired, went to my GP, was diagnosed with coeliac disease, so I began a gluten-free diet and cannot believe now how much better I feel. It was discovered I had osteoporosis, which did not make any sense at all. Now I have been diagnosed with coeliac disease and thank goodness it will not get any worse.' Those comments are from the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Australian Coeliac</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>magazine, which is produced by Coeliac Australia. The first step in the diagnosis is a blood test that can be ordered by your GP, and I encourage anyone with symptoms of coeliac disease to visit their GP and discuss the possibility of having the disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow, Coeliac Awareness Week is being launched at Parliament House with an information day and complimentary blood screening for members, senators and staff who have symptoms of coeliac disease. There will also be an information table, where people who have an interest in the condition can find out more about coeliac disease. I certainly encourage my colleagues and staff at Parliament House to take advantage of this service, and I congratulate Coeliac Australia on their work to assist those with coeliac disease and for organising the annual Coeliac Awareness Week to raise awareness, testing and diagnosis of coeliac disease.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:45</span>):  Right now over 1,000 young people are on their way to Canberra, driving across Australia in cars and vans and buses as part of an event called Roadtrip 2013. Roadtrip 2013 is bringing together Australia's most passionate young people, who will be trained to become leaders and ambassadors to help fight global poverty. From 9 to 16 March, groups of young people from all over Australia will be convoying through marginal electorates all across Australia to encourage others to join in the movement to end extreme poverty. They will then meet together in Canberra on Thursday morning on the lawns of parliament, and they will be asking the government to increase the foreign aid budget to 0.7 per cent by 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian Roadtrips will be going through Adelaide, Bordertown, Mount Gambier, Bendigo and Ballarat. I was very pleased to meet with over 80 of the participants in Adelaide last Saturday and to see them off as they departed from Glenelg, in my electorate. Included among them were many of my constituents who have taken the time to write to me recently—by hand, in many cases—about why ending global poverty matters to them. They included Kendra Pratt, Jake Alker, Andrea Beaumont, Maddi Veitch, Nick Harpas, Tina Tran, Portia Vail and Kendal, who is from Cowandilla, close to where I grew up. We sat on the grass under blue skies in Moseley Square at Glenelg and talked about why it is important that we fight poverty and what we can do as a country, as members of parliament, as individuals and as groups, to end it forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The group I met, like the participants taking part from all over Australia this week, are young and they are energetic. But they are also smart, practical, visionary and driven to make change. They include people like Kate Helmore and Emily Haren, who are leaders of the Oaktree Foundation in South Australia, the organisation coordinating the trip. They know that the future of this country is theirs. Long after all of us have gone from this place, they will be the caretakers of our nation, and they know that they have the power to make it better. But I was very impressed to hear about the sacrifices they have already made—work hours, study time, family celebrations and social events with friends—to contribute to this good cause. I hope they know that what they are doing is worthwhile and that it is inspiring and energising for us as members of parliament when we see people in our community with such passion working towards such a good goal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that when they get to Canberra they receive a warm welcome from their MPs, no matter what side of politics they are on, and that their voices are heard loud and clear. Their message is simple—that a foreign aid budget of 0.7 per cent is the right thing to do as a wealthy nation and that it does not mean leaving Australians behind. I personally am proud to support an increase to the aid budget to 0.7 per cent, and I was very glad to receive the assurances of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when I raised it with him this morning, that he is too. We are a wealthy nation. We can afford to look after people living in our country but also do our fair share for others overseas in some of our nearest neighbouring countries who did not have the fortune to be born here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 20 years alone the current generation has already halved extreme poverty. Now, as we move into the final stage before the Millennium Development Goals deadline, it is absolutely time to finish the job. That is the message that Roadtrip 2013 are bringing to Canberra this Thursday for the launch of the Movement to End Poverty, and I hope all MPs will support them. Congratulations to everyone involved and I look forward to seeing them all in Canberra very soon. In the meantime, I urge all members and everyone to support Roadtrip 2013 by visiting their website at www.roadtrip2013.com.au or liking their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/theroadtripAU. Please support this very good cause.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:49</span>):  Once again I rise to highlight the disgraceful waste and mismanagement and the economic vandalism carried out by the Gillard Labor government in my electorate. I raise again the issue of the RAAF Base Eaton houses that are still sitting there vacant, rotting and wasting away, all because the Gillard Labor government is too pig-headed and too out of touch with Territorians to do the right thing and help alleviate some of the pressure of the current Top End housing crisis. It is important to know that in my electorate the median rental price in December 2012 was $650 a week, yet the Gillard Labor government does not seem to care about families or housing affordability in the Territory. If it did, it would not let these RAAF base houses remain empty, would it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For almost four years, the member for Fong Lim and I have been working together to make the Rudd-Gillard Labor governments see some sense and make these RAAF base houses available to Territorians. It is incredible to think that for almost four years the <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">, </span>a fellow Territorian, Minister Snowdon, has not been able to see sense and make these houses available for Territorians. He has demonstrated again and again how out of touch he is with Territorians. He has heard their pleas and anguish over the blatant economic mismanagement of these taxpayer funded resources, but he chooses to ignore them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one I speak to can see the logic that, in the middle of a housing crisis, over 200 houses are sitting there unused and vacant. As I have said so many times before, these houses are now rotting away. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for defence and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs were in Darwin recently and they saw firsthand the utter waste and economic vandalism that the Gillard Labor government is condoning. They were shocked at the blatant waste of taxpayer funded resources. They saw for themselves that these houses that many Territorians would give anything to live in; they know that these RAAF base houses are no different to houses in the northern suburbs. These houses in the northern suburbs are in high demand—very high demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These RAAF base houses sit vacant despite the fact that this parliament passed unanimously my private member's motion in 2011 which called on the Gillard Labor government to excise the houses from Defence so that they could be made available to Territorians. Yet they are still sitting there—vacant rotting away day by day. The incompetent handling of this very important local issue in my electorate by the Gillard Labor government is shameful, disgusting and outrageous. The Labor government thinks by removing houses, as it did in the Coonawarrra Naval Base, that the problem is solved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I saw what the government considers a solution—26 of the 40 houses removed from Coonawarra base are sitting in a vacant block, also rotting away. The Labor government promised that these houses would be used a solution to affordable housing in Darwin. Yet, four years later, 65 per cent of these houses removed are not being used. It is a disgrace. Minister Snowdon is patting himself on the back for a job well done. We know he has issued a tender to remove 200 houses from the Eaton RAAF base, just as they did with the Coonawarra houses. This is despite the fact that none of these houses is being used effectively by Territorians to ease the housing crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government is out of touch and out of control. There is no doubt that this Gillard Labor government is wasteful and should be held accountable for its economic vandalism. Removing houses off Defence bases simply because they are Defence assets and not DHA assets is not good enough. We have heard excuse after excuse as to why these houses in this ready made suburb cannot be used by Territorians. Let me tell you, Territorians want to be able to access these houses. They do not want to see them rotting away. Why can't this government do the right thing by Territorians and make these houses available?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:54</span>):  Perhaps the ugliest outcome of the tragedy of Prisoner X is the exploitation of this issue by the usual suspects to denigrate Israel and particularly the Australian Jewish community, of which I am a very proud representative. Given the official ethos of multiculturalism in Australia, no other Australian minority would have been so savagely disrespected by various political, academic and media commentators in a similar situation. I include Professor Ben Saul in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>, the international affairs editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>, Tony Walker, and Elizabeth Jackson from the ABC. As the Sydney Institute's media watchdog noted: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Professor Saul's article contains the kind of undocumented generalisations which would not be acceptable in an undergraduate law essay at the University of Sydney. Professor Saul's article is replete with imputations that what he calls "Australian Jews" are not loyal to their country. Saul runs the line that there is a "problem of divided loyalties among Australians with multiple national identities". He focuses on Jewish Australians who are also Israeli citizens and also mentions "Americans" and "Chinese". </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are six million Australians, who have more than one passport, and the absurdity of taking Professor Saul's allegations to all those Australians would highlight the disgraceful nature of his attack on 10,000 people who have dual Israeli-Australian nationality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Saul runs the line that Australian Jews choose loyalty to Israel over Australia. Gerard Henderson makes it clear that none of these imputations would be acceptable even publishable, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> if they were directed at an entity which might be termed in Saul's style—not mine, I might say—'Australian Muslims' with respect to any country. Saul and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> seem to single out Jewish Australians in a way that is totally unacceptable in a pluralist society like Australia. The allegations that Australians have loyalty to a nation other than Australia is as old as the Commonwealth of Australia, Henderson argues, and as offensive. Despite Saul's imputations, there is no evidence that Jewish Australians, whether they hold dual nationality or not, are anything other than loyal Australians. It is laughable when you look at the Australian Jewish community—and I know of so many contributions in so many different areas—to be subject to this kind of disgraceful attack in the soon-to-be-demised Melbourne <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is offensive to question the patriotism of the Australian Jewish community based on the activities of one ex-Australian, who was the citizen of a foreign country. In no other case would Saul or his ilk seek to apply the collective responsibility á la the Herschel Grynszpan case in 1939. Greens boss Christine Milne railed about the suppression order in terms of the claim that Mr Zygier was being held without legal representation. Of course, there are suppression orders in this country, but she never apologised the next day, when Mr Zygier was represented by three leading lawyers—Roi Belcher, Moshe Mazor and Boaz Ben-Zur—or his human rights lawyer Avigdor Feldman was reported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole affair has been dreadfully handled by some people in the media. The worst was perhaps the assumptions made by Elizabeth Jackson on AM and the free ride she gave the telephone box spokesman, Antony Lowenstein, who she interviewed. I particularly objected to her implied attacks on Jewish schools and on Jewish religious leaders. The schools in my electorate—Yeshivah, Yavneh, Bialik and Mt Scopus—regularly come in the top 10 schools in Victoria and it is a disgrace for them to be portrayed as centres of espionage by Elizabeth Jackson and Anthony Lowenstein. Worse was what she said about Jewish religious practice. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So what are your observations about the way that Jewish institutions, and perhaps it even happens in the synagogues, I don’t know—but how do they facilitate this kind of mentality?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />What kind of incitement is that to be broadcast on our ABC? Can you imagine if one of the broadcasters made similar remarks about Australian Muslims? I think this whole affair has been treated disgracefully by extreme left politicians like the Australian Greens, the ABC and the Melbourne <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>. The foreign minister quite rightly said that this affair had been handled quite well between the Australian security agencies and Israel. We should look to mainstream criticisms of the handing of Australian passports— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="EM6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr STONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:37</span>):  Goulburn-Murray Water is a state owned water authority which manages the huge irrigation system of northern Victoria, a system which covers much of my own electorate of Murray. The area generates billions of dollars worth of manufactured and fresh food every year. The authority has been responsible for managing the storage and delivery of water through over 6,000 kilometres of distribution channels across an area roughly the size of Tasmania. They have been doing this for a number of years—the water system itself is over a century old.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 1,900 gigalitres of water were once available for growing the best dairy and fruit produce in Australia. Now there are only some 1,000 gigalitres, with an expectation that this volume will drop further, down to 900 gigalitres, in the very near future. That is less than half what was available some 10 years ago. You might be wondering how this has happened and why this has happened—this extraordinary reduction in water access—given that our part of northern Victoria has very low and erratic rainfall. Without a secure water supply, you simply cannot have the volumes of food production and food manufacturing we had for as long as those previous irrigation water volumes were applied to our land. Are we not supposed to be entering a golden era of new demand for high-quality food from the areas to our north—Asia, China and India? We are regularly told about the opportunities for growth in our markets and in the value of our exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you about the policy failures which have turned a natural disaster—a 10- or 12-year long drought—into a long-term crisis for the economies of northern Victoria. In the generations when water was secure, food factories grew up in every country town in the Goulburn and Murray valleys. There the workers lived and raised their families in thriving communities as they provided a skilled and loyal workforce and all the support services. The local factories became famous for iconic Australian brands—Rosella, SPC, Ardmona, IXL, Devondale, Ibis and Bonlac. These brands were a guarantee of reliable quality and Australia's finest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By 1998, the worst drought on record was well underway. For the first time the 100-year-old irrigation system failed. Farmers had zero allocations at the beginning of the season. In areas like the Campaspe and Loddon, there were no allocations for all of the irrigation season. At the height of this drought, with Melbourne, Bendigo and Ballarat also running short of water, pipelines were pushed into the failing Goulburn system to take water away from the struggling farmers and their towns and divert it to the city populations to the south. This 10-year drought lasted, ironically, until the worst floods on record arrived—in the summer of 2011 in the west and in the summer of 2012 in the east of the electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To survive the drought, farmers bought in extra feed for their livestock or sent their livestock away on agistment. Farmers sold thousands of heifers to China and whole herds were trucked off to the Tongala abattoir to be processed into hamburger mince for export. Finally, even the abattoir ran out of dairy herds for slaughter. Despite their best efforts, farmer indebtedness rose steeply during the drought, often more than doubling. More than 1,000 families could only put food on the table by accessing the federal exceptional circumstances grants. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the peak of the drought, the Labor government entered the farmers' water market, offering to buy the irrigators' high-security water entitlements at an inflated price for an environmental water pool. Many farmers were then forced by their lenders to sell some of their water entitlement to reduce their mounting debts. Others, exhausted financially, physically and emotionally, took the opportunity to sell all of their water, knowing it would mean the end of their food production capacity but at least perhaps the survival of their marriage or their children's future livelihood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2006, in the northern Victorian shires of the City of Greater Shepparton, Moira, Campaspe, Loddon and Gannawarra, 2,721 properties were devoted to dairying. That had halved by 2008. You might think our troubles are over now—the drought is over, the floods are over—but, no, they are not. Now we have the Victorian government continuing to want to halve what is left of the irrigation system, forcing irrigators to sell up their water and to convert from irrigation to stock and domestic only. This policy is designed to rescue Goulburn-Murray Water, a state owned monopoly, from its soaring debts and costs. It is a policy failure and a tragedy of the worst order. It has to stop. I call on the Victorian and federal governments to do much better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:04</span>):  Canberra bashing is a pastime we here in the national capital are used to. Normally, I do not dignify it with a response. Normally I speak out only to advocate for Canberra or to defend Canberra. But I can no longer ignore the naysayers. On Canberra's 100th birthday, I once again feel compelled to defend our great national capital. As with Washington, people use the name of our city when they mean 'the seat of government'. As with Washington, we were born of a feud between two cities into a landscape which was pretty harsh at the time. Again as with Washington, some of the state capital cities which would have preferred to have been the national capital still have a few issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who do not like politics or the government deride Canberra out of ignorance or indifference. But I really took exception this week to an article by Martin McKenzie-Murray, a columnist and former Labor speechwriter, because he made his allegations and vicious remarks about Canberra in the context of our birthday. Quite frankly it is bad manners to say these sorts of things on someone's birthday. That is why I feel compelled to speak out about this even though it is not my normal practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not sure how long Mr McKenzie-Murray lived here or how much of our city and region he saw but I want to correct some of his myths and misconceptions. First, I do not think Canberrans curse our 'weird remoteness' any more than people who live in Perth, Darwin or Hobart. We are two hours from the best ski fields in Australia, the same distance to the beautiful, wonderful, magnificent South Coast of New South Wales and a 20-minute flight from Sydney. I do not think this makes us 'weirdly remote' at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to this critic, the architects of Canberra, Walter and Marion Griffin, imposed a 'diabolically impaired vision' on us. What they imposed on us was an ideal city, an ideal city with a prairie modernism—an embodiment of their aspirations for equity. He said they imposed on us a city not like any other city in the world, not just a new city for a new nation—a democratic city for a democratic nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know what is diabolically impaired with this author's views, and that is this myth that a planned city is automatically boring or sterile. Perhaps it is laziness or simply pandering to stereotypes that stops some people from looking more closely at Canberra. I do not know how many times I have heard people say they came to Canberra for a year or a short-term job and stayed because they loved it. Like so many others, when I arrived here I fell in love with the place—and I fell in love. I came here for six months and I have been here for 20-plus years. This is a normal Canberra story—you come here for a short time, you fall in love, you fall in love with the place and you stay. What really annoys me about this populist puff piece are the tired old cliches about the Public Service. Without research or evidence Mr McKenzie-Murray wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">From my limited experience I not only saw staffing surpluses, I saw team morale bruised by grossly inadequate executives spending our time and money on obscuring the root fact of their uselessness. It's a vague form of corruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public servants are valued and valuable people. They manage our hospitals and health services, our schools, our universities and our transport networks. They look after our environment, our defence forces and our financial institutions. Those who run down and belittle public servants insult the people who run this country, who serve democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The author also wrote that the attributes of Canberra were essentially parakeets and mountains, and that they did not make a city; people do. I agree with him. Canberra has exceptional people. Cities are made by the people who live in them, and in my view Canberra is peopled with the creme de la creme. You go to dinner parties and you talk about policies and ideas and visions; you go doorknocking and you meet people who have written the policies that you are talking about. It is an extraordinary city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am shamelessly proud of Canberra, and you only have to go out and see the way we are celebrating our centenary to see the strength of this community and the spirit of our soul. It was beautifully summed up yesterday at the centenary by Michael Costello, who talked about the fact that we are not just celebrating our community; we are also celebrating our country and our democracy. It is a democracy that was based on enlightenment and social democratic principles; it was forged not through civil war but through peace and common purpose. That is what Canberra is all about—a symbol of our democracy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="M3K" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CROOK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:09</span>):  I rise tonight extremely proud of, and excited to report to the House, the outstanding success of the Nationals WA in last weekend's state election in Western Australia. The weekend saw the Nationals' presence in the lower house of the state parliament rise from five to seven members with two seats, Kimberley and Eyre, still too close to call.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, the Nationals campaigned on the Royalties for Regions policy, pointing out that the two major parties had neglected regional WA for years on end. Now that this election is over, it is no surprise to see the Nationals increasing the number of regional seats they hold, on the back of the successful Royalties for Regions policy which has delivered billions of dollars back into the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I note the political nous and courage of the Leader of the National Party of Western Australia, Brendon Grylls. Brendon took a risk like never before, leaving his safe Central Wheatbelt seat in the capable hands of Mia Davies and winning Pilbara. Many said the risk was dangerous, but in my opinion Brendon—even if he had lost—should go down in history as one of the greatest political leaders WA has ever seen. Brendon won his seat, and the Nationals' expansion into the north is simply fantastic and a testament to the benefits Royalties for Regions is providing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I congratulate Wendy Duncan and welcome her home to Kalgoorlie. Wendy took a similar risk to Brendon's. She left her safe seat in the Mining and Pastoral region to run for the lower house, and the electorate of Kalgoorlie will be lucky to have Wendy as our local member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, I would like to mention the now extremely marginal seat of Eyre. My last check of the Electoral Commission website had local farmer Colin de Grussa 55 votes ahead of the incumbent. This is an outstanding effort and against all odds. I hope Colin is getting some sleep, because I know he has not had much in the last three or four days. Regardless of the outcome, Colin has put Eyre well and truly back on the political map.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Vince Catania, Shane Love, Tuck Waldron, Mia Davies and Terry Redman go my sincere congratulations. And to Dave Grills, who is on a knife edge: good luck, mate—you deserve an opportunity and I hope you get it. To Rob Sutton, Michelle Pucci, Shane van Styn and all our unsuccessful candidates, congratulations on your hard work and the dedication you continue to show your local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this campaign, the opposition to the Nationals, both Labor and Liberal, continually said they would continue the Royalties for Regions policy. Some Liberal candidates even went as far as criticising the Nationals for calling it their own when it was delivered by the WA government. I note this technicality, but next some WA Liberals will be saying that the Anglicans appoint the Pope. The Nationals WA developed this policy, campaigned strongly on it and, most importantly, delivered it. In politics there is no greater testament than delivering on something you have campaigned for and worked on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On every occasion possible I take the opportunity to praise Royalties for Regions. It is the envy of all other states as far as regional funding schemes go, and it blows out of the water the Regional Development Australia Fund administered by this federal government. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend Australian</span> reported that this government plans to use money from the Regional Development Australia Fund to sandbag marginal Sydney seats in the lead-up to the federal election. Minister Crean is well aware of my thoughts about the RDA Fund and how it is administered. Compared to Royalties for Regions, it has failed miserably, particularly in regional WA. This is despite the Commonwealth happily using WA's wealth to prop up the eastern states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this reason, I today wrote to the member for Lyne, Rob Oakeshott, and the member for New England, Tony Windsor, requesting their involvement in this matter, as the RDA Fund was an agreement between them and Labor reached in the formation of this government. According to today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, Rob and Tony will be meeting with the Prime Minister in relation to this issue, and I look forward to hearing the outcome of that meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I once again offer my sincere congratulations to the WA Nationals on an outstanding result. They no longer hold the balance of power, which is unfortunate, but it has to be said that they delivered an outstanding regional policy and, more importantly, they have delivered stable government, which is where this parliament is failing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="172770" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SMYTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:14</span>):  It is timely that I reflect on stable government, because, far from the previous speaker's concluding remarks, I find myself in a slightly different set of circumstances in my home state of Victoria. This evening I would like to raise a fairly serious topic that I have raised in this place before and that is raised repeatedly with me by constituents right across my electorate and beyond in Victoria. Like many Victorians, I am extremely troubled by the state government's tax cuts made under Premier Baillieu, and, regrettably—despite my getting my hopes up earlier on today at the prospect of a favourable announcement on TAFE—Premier Napthine has, it seems, squibbed the opportunity to actually respond to the continued problem of the defunding of TAFE in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The TAFE cuts have had quite devastating consequences for individuals, such as for the very many staff who have lost their jobs across the state. In my own electorate, I am very much aware of individuals who have lost their jobs. I can think of one person in particular whom I certainly will not name this evening, but I reflect on his circumstances: he has three young children and no longer has an income, so now the family have only one pay packet out of two to support them. It really does trouble me very much that there are many people who find themselves in his circumstances. When they are people later in their careers, they might find it very difficult to find other work in a comparable situation. The TAFE defunding also has devastating consequences for students, needless to say—both current students in the system and prospective students who are looking for a pathway to postsecondary education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some cases, in a more pronounced way, TAFE defunding has devastating consequences for whole communities, as we have seen with Lilydale, where the campus was not only a source of local employment and, obviously, a place for students to come to and learn but also a valuable piece of community infrastructure. So these cuts have extremely significant and long-term ramifications for communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it was very troubling today, when I had hoped that the new Premier of Victoria, Denis Napthine, might have taken the opportunity to meaningfully respond and provide appropriate funding to restore TAFE to its former position, to hear that he did not. Nevertheless, he announced an amount of $200 million over four years. To be clear, that is $50 million each year. This is seemingly for innovation and structural reform. Against this, the state government have cut around $1.2 billion across the same period of time. Last year alone, the state government cut around $290 million from TAFE, including what is referred to as full service provider funding, which means the funding TAFEs use, for instance, to provide assistance to students with a disability, amongst other important services. Certainly, we know that the Victorian TAFE Association and others have estimated that the resulting job impacts will be around 2,000 staff redundancies across the state and 1,400 in Melbourne alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences of TAFE being defunded by a cool billion dollars are not just for those in the sector as workers or current students; obviously, there are also significant consequences for, if you like, 'feeder' schools—schools that are currently offering TAFE subjects and pathways for their students to postsecondary education. In my electorate, one of those schools is Kambrya College, and another that I can think of is Berwick Secondary College. Indeed, I have had the opportunity to visit them in the last couple of weeks. At Kambrya, for instance, last year around 60 per cent of senior school students were doing TAFE subjects as part of their VCEs or VCALs. Those students are offered a pathway to TAFE or other postsecondary education, and it gives them options. The school's principal has recently said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What these TAFE cuts have done is reduce the options, so the offerings we had before will no longer be available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an extraordinary situation that local schools find themselves in. It is in direct contrast to what we as a federal government have been offering. Indeed, two schools in my electorate have been beneficiaries of the trade-training centre program, and I dearly hope to see more. I certainly hope that schools like Kambrya College and Berwick Secondary College will look to the things that we are doing and find some comfort in the federal government's support for vocational education and training. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:19</span>):  I am pleased to have the opportunity this evening to discuss a number of aspects of the government's program with respect to NBN Co. and what it actually means for Gold Coasters and, more broadly, for the people of Australia. Last week I had the opportunity to travel to China with Huawei to examine firsthand what is taking place in China and the extent to which one of the world's leading internet and telecommunications infrastructure providers—that is, Huawei—is supplying globally. I contrast its efforts with, for example, the likes of Ericsson, Alcatel and others. What is clear is that, when it comes to value for money, my worst concern about NBN Co. is that the current Labor government's pathological desire to ensure that it rolls out fibre to the home to every single Australian, at a cost of approximately $38 billion to Australian taxpayers, continues unabated, despite some of the best evidence that I had the opportunity to witness over the past week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did this in the context of having recently received from a constituent of mine an email in which he expressed and outlined his concern about not having access to broadband and what that meant to him in Broadbeach, one of the suburbs in my electorate. Those on the opposite side might say, 'Hang on; this just reinforces the point, Member for Moncrieff, that we rapidly need broadband.' But bear with me, Madam Speaker, and I will outline why it could not possibly be further from the truth and that Labor's solution is in fact not a solution. This particular constituent—I will not mention his name, in compliance with the standing orders—wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">You probably have already a lot of emails on this matter. I would like to ask you to advance the matter of the lack of high speed/high data internet for Nerang. Where my wife &amp; I live across from Nerang High we only have access to wireless broadband. this means that data is limited and very expensive. Telstra refuse to roll out ADSL+ to Nerang ahead of the NBN. But now the GC—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, the Gold Coast—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">is not expected to be connected until as late as 2015. So access to TV or other streaming or high data programs to any real extent is not possible for us until then. I may also write to the telcomunications minister and shadow minister but Nerang I believe is being poorly serviced by Telstra in this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, I received an email from a constituent who is based in Broadbeach and who expressed his deep concern about the lack of access there. So I have those two emails from constituents in which they asked me why they cannot access high-speed broadband in Australia's sixth-largest city—a city of some 500,000 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason is that the current Labor government say they are going to advance NBN Co. We already know how many revisions of NBN Co. there have been. When the original NBN Co. plan was put out in December 2010 the government expected that, at its peak, the NBN would pass 5,900 houses per day and connect 4,000 houses per day. When the plan was revised in August 2012 they had ramped up the numbers, saying that they expected in the peak period to pass 6,850 houses per day and connect 6,000 houses per day. It was a big increase of 16 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. Yet, if you look at the premises passed by fibre, you see that the original plan had 1.268 million households being passed while the revised figure, in August 2012, was 341,000—a downwards revision of 73 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These figures tell the story of Labor's abysmal failure on NBN Co. It is costing $38 billion which is not on the budget sheet at a time when the government is projected to be $200 billion in net debt already. In addition, the UK analysis results by Huawei, which recently rolled out fibre to the node across the UK, show that fibre to the home is five times more expensive than fibre to the curb. The question is: what speed do they get from fibre to the curb in the UK? The answer is that they get up to 1,000 megabits per second by utilising a combination of fibre and copper. Labor's record on the NBN stands condemned.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:24</span>):  Much has been made of the conflicting statements made by the Leader of the Opposition about climate change. At one time he supported the evidence; later he denied the truth of the science. Despite his early support for a carbon tax, he began to espouse denial in the town of Beaufort, Victoria, where, as Craig Wilson, editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pyrenees Advocate</span>, reported, the Leader of the Opposition in referring to the science stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The argument is absolute crap. However, the politics of this are tough for us. Eighty per cent of people believe climate change is a real and present danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> reported by Stuart Rintoul on 12 December 2009 says, inter alia:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">According to many in the room, he left no doubt that he was a climate change sceptic. He ruminated there had been many changes of climate over the millennia not caused by man. Finally, he said the science behind climate change was "crap" …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we see that the decision of the opposition to claim that the science behind measures to reduce carbon dioxide is crap was not based on evidence and was not acquired at a meeting with experts. Neither was it the result of careful study; it was the result of a cynical realisation that political advantage was to be gained from misrepresentation and deception, no matter the eventual consequences for the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition's claim, which calls into question the credibility of such strongly supported evidence for the effects of global warming, has deliberately damaged the reputation of science and the scientists who carry out research into climate change and, by implication, all other areas of scientific investigation. Further, the undermining by the Leader of the Opposition of public confidence in science for political gain has directly harmed the national interest of the country and motivated an ignorant and scientifically illiterate fringe who, at worst, have made death threats against scientists working to understand the harmful effects of carbon dioxide emissions. The problem, as pointed out by CP Snow, for deniers such as the Leader of the Opposition is that they either lack the knowledge required to understand the evidence behind the warnings of the scientists or are unwilling to accept that science is an objective means of elucidating the nature of events in the natural world.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course the earth's climate has changed and will continue to change both under the influence of changes in the solar constant, which slowly increases over hundreds of millions of years as a consequence of continental drift moving the continents around over periods of millions of years, and as an effect of astronomical cycles hundreds of thousands of years long driving the ice ages. However, the present measurable changes that we see in the climate and the oceans are happening at a timescale of a few hundred years to a few decades and are entirely attributable to the effects of an increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide which is being produced by the burning of fossil fuels. There is abundant evidence from the fossil record and from observations of Venus and Mars that carbon dioxide controls the climate on those planets and on the earth, through processes that are very well understood. As is well known, the surface of a planet warms as it absorbs energy from the sun in visible wavelengths where carbon dioxide is transparent and then re-emits energy in the infrared at wavelengths where carbon dioxide is opaque. The effect is that incoming energy from the sun is trapped and warms the surface and the atmosphere instead of radiating directly to space.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are rightly concerned about the consequences of the election of an Abbott government if the policies of the conservative governments of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Canada are any guide to the likely behaviour of a federal Liberal-National party government. In Canada the Arctic is in meltdown, yet the Conservative party, which is led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, has abandoned commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has cut back spending on science and has muzzled scientists who may dare to make statements that deviate from the government's position on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the new Canadian government has shut down the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory, the key monitoring system for measuring global temperatures and ozone levels, presumably as a cost-cutting measure and probably because the laboratory was producing results that undermined the official position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Would the Leader of the Opposition be a wrecker like his Canadian counterpart and shut down the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station in Tasmania, which is a research facility of international importance that provides the best measurements of the global average of air quality, including the level of carbon dioxide and other pollutants? I ask the Leader of the Opposition to place in writing his commitment to maintain this internationally important facility should he ever become Prime Minister of our nation.</span>

            </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Chief Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your overt promptness. Today at 6.30 pm there will be a special function in Parliament House to recognise and promote the work of the Clontarf Foundation. The Clontarf Foundation was started in Perth, from memory, about 15 years ago. It is a program based on Australian Rules football and engaging Aboriginal boys and young men. Over time it has evolved and operates in most states and territories in Australia. Indeed, for the last 12 months it has been operating in four locations in my electorate. We have academies in Bourke, Brewarrina, Coonamble and Moree. In New South Wales it is no longer based on Australian rules but on rugby league.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Tuesday, at 6.30 in the morning, I attended the Clontarf Academy in Moree. I travelled on the bus as it went around to the homes of these lads, who are in years 7, 8 and 9. I was at the junior academy. There are two sites in Moree: one at the senior school and one at the middle school. About 35 turned up at the school in all, and we engaged in football training for about an hour. We had a game of touch football and various exercises, in which the local federal member was completely humiliated by the athletic ability of these boys. What is remarkable is that these lads would previously have already had their first brush with the law. They would already have opted out of school. One of the boys I spoke to did not go to school once last year. He was living with his grandmother. They did not know he existed. But because of the Clontarf Foundation he is now coming along to school. They go to training, they have breakfast and they have a room at the school, where they are mentored and given advice. I have to say that I have not been in a group of young teenage men that was more polite, more respectful or calmer.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this place talk about a lot of things with regard to our Aboriginal brothers and sisters, but I have never seen a program like Clontarf Foundation. I would encourage anyone who is available tonight to go along. The Governor-General, who is the patron for the foundation, will be here. I believe it deserves the support of everyone in this House. At that age these boys have been put on the right track. They are getting support right through into adulthood; in fact, some of the boys who started off in Perth all those years ago are nearing 30. The Clontarf Foundation is something to watch and something to support.</span>

        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">
            <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
              <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
            </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I endorse the statements of my colleague. On a similar topic, youth issues, I take the opportunity today to extend a very big happy birthday to headspace Wollongong, which turned five years old last month. I attended its birthday on the beach with Minister Kate Lundy. We took the opportunity to talk to a lot of the staff and commend them on this very important birthday occasion.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2008 I had the great pleasure of attending, with the former member for Throsby, Jennie George, the opening of headspace Wollongong in its original premises and acknowledging, particularly, the work of Dr Andrew Dalley locally in getting underway that particular headspace. I think it was one of the first three in the country and has fulfilled a very important role in our local community. Indeed, we were informed that over the last 12 months headspace has helped 914 young people, delivering over 10,000 services—about 10 services per young person. Clearly that is a group of young people who may well not have accessed the sorts of medical and mental health services that they would have needed if this very youth-specific service had not been available. Beyond service delivery on site, the local headspace goes out into local schools and community organisations, running information and education programs on health and wellbeing for young people. It is a very, very valuable service.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that each time headspace holds a function here in Parliament House colleagues from all across the parliament attend to express their support for this very important service. I think it is tremendous that it is so well encouraged and supported. In fact, I think that the biggest dispute is always members wanting a new headspace in their area. Everybody wants to be able to sign up for the young people in their region to have access to this excellent service.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Since headspace was established in Wollongong in 2008, all up about 3,250 people have attended the service in Wollongong. It is a team of youth workers, GPs, psychologists and mental health nurses who work together to support the young patients. At the time of the birthday party, a local GP, Dr John Watson, acknowledged the work of all of the team and we all paid respect to their efforts—including the receptionist, Nicola, which shows that the whole team creating a warm, non-threatening and friendly place to go is so important in supporting the health and overall wellbeing of our young people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
            </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  I am delighted to talk about the Voices of the Outer Suburbs campaign being sponsored by the Star News Group and the Cardinia mayor, Brett Owen, amongst others for Casey and Cardinia, two of the municipalities within my area, the latter of which I share with my friend and colleague the member for McMillan, who is in the chamber at this moment.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for the city of Casey and the shire of Cardinia is one of growth. These are two fantastic municipalities. We have seen, whether it is in the coastal villages or Koo Wee Rup or Lang Lang, growth, population, families coming together and quality of life but also some of the difficulties associated with all of these issues of increasing population. We have had challenges, for example, in relation to services and roads. The Voices of the Outer Suburbs campaign has been launched and I give it my full and complete support.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">It is against that background that the Star News Group has adopted it as an appropriate and rightful campaign for those two areas, and it is against that background that I want to outline the four areas in my parts of the municipalities of Casey and Cardinia in which I think we can make real progress as part of the Voices of the Outer Suburbs campaign. The first is in relation to the lack of internet access, particularly in an area such as Botanic Ridge. There is no point waiting for the National Broadband Network, because, for many people, it is not going to come over the next decade. It is a provide omise without a delivery date.</span>

            </a>  It is, as my other friend and colleague in the chamber the member for Kooyong says, a promise, like the surplus, without a delivery date. Most significantly, we need to work on real access now, and that means both wireless and fibre to the node.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area is work on the Bunyip Food Belt project. It is a fantastic project that uses tertiary treated recycled water, and is a huge boost for local agricultural production. The third area is relation to bypasses for Koo Wee Rup and Lang Lang. The Koo Wee Rup project is seeing enormous progress being made in the planning, and I hope to see it delivered. The Lang Lang bypass is a project on which we will continue to work. The fourth component is reticulated natural gas for Koo Wee Rup and the coastal villages of Cannons Creek, Tooradin, Warneet and Blind Bight.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
            </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Last week I marked International Women's Day in the Chifley electorate by hosting the Coral McLean Award breakfast. I was delighted to be joined by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tanya Plibersek, who was warmly welcomed by all those in attendance. As well as paying tribute to the extraordinary contribution of women to the fabric of our community, the award and breakfast honour the selfless contribution of Coral McLean, who passed away in 2011 and is often described as the mother of Mt Druitt. She contributed over 100,000 hours to our community, particularly in the area of social justice, remains fondly remembered and is an inspiration to others.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">I hosted my first International Women's Day breakfast two years ago. It was a relatively small gathering of about 30 local women, and last week's breakfast brought together over 100 women, representing every facet of our community. The calibre of this year's nominations made the task for the judges all the more difficult and I want to thank those people who took the time to recognise and nominate friends, colleagues and associates.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank the three judges for their deliberations and wise judgment in making these awards. This year's judges were: Alice Wheatley, who is the Regional Manager of Anglicare Mt Druitt and who nominated last year's award winner; Merleen Millson, who worked alongside Coral at the Mt Druitt Area Legal Centre, a strong advocate for equal pay for women; and Yasodai Selvakumaran, a HSIE and Aboriginal studies teacher at Rooty Hill High School.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">The winner of this year's Coral McLean Award was a very surprised and very deserving Margaret Boyd from Woodcroft. Margaret takes volunteering to the extreme as a regular volunteer guide at the Westmead Children's Hospital, by raising money for Dunrossil Disability Services and by working with veterans and widows with Rooty Hill Naval Association, who acknowledge that without her leadership they would struggle to get things done.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Rita Tobin of Willmot and Alicia Martin of Marayong were jointly named Chifley Women of the Year. Rita returned to study at age 74 completing a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and Aboriginal Studies. In 1998 she became involved in the Mt Druitt and District Reconciliation Group, where she worked closely with Coral McLean. Alicia founded the non-profit organisation Food Within, which provides low- to middle-income families struggling to make ends meet with healthier lifestyle choices.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty-six-year-old Liza Moscatelli was named Young Chifley Woman of the Year. She is heavily involved with the Ted Noffs Foundation of Mt Druitt, where she inspires others with her passion for music and photography. She has completed a social work degree and has been part of the Street University initiative for two years and facilitates art workshops.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the depth of the nominations this year, the judges decided to make a Judges Commendation Award, which went to Ambika Dhungyel. Ambika came to Australia four years ago after spending 17 years in a refugee camp in Nepal. She has become an active volunteer in the Bhutanese community in Sydney. I want to congratulate all the winners and everyone who was nominated.</span>

              <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FRYDENBERG</span>
            </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I rise to raise an important health issue—namely, the prevalence of strokes in our community and the impact that they have on our fellow citizens. In Australia today there are 60,000 strokes every year, a number which will only increase as our population ages. One in six people in Australia will suffer a stroke in their lifetime. In fact, strokes kill more women than breast cancer and more men than prostate cancer and are the second biggest killer after heart disease. Around 20 per cent of people who suffer strokes are under the age of 55. The cost to society in terms of human hardship is extreme, not to mention the more than $2 billion financial cost that has been quantified as a result of strokes.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to important organisations in our community like the Howard Florey Institute, which does so much work in stroke prevention research and in its clinical trials. Also at a local level, I have had the privilege of getting to know the Boroondara Stroke Support Group and its founder and president, Jenny Cheng, and last year I attended its 10th anniversary celebration. It has around 100 members that are affected by stroke and provides self-help for these survivors, for their carers and for volunteers, and provides a range of activities including art and recreation, sport and strength training, as well as gardening and other activities.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the privilege recently to meet with two outstanding women: Dawn Oldham and a lady called Emma Gee. Both are stroke survivors. Dawn Oldham, who is a resident in the Boroondara, was a talented stockbroker. At age 42 she was struck down by a stroke. In her words, 'I had a stroke in my pantry while I was preparing for dinner, the same day I played basketball and scored three goals and was feeling fantastic.' It was because her husband had seen the advertisement for FAST, the Face, Arm, Speech and Time campaign on TV, that he was able to deal with her incident of stroke.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">So it was too with Emma Gee. Emma was 24 years of age, was working full time as an occupational therapist and was an avid runner when she was struck down with a stroke while having an operation to remove the arteriovenous malformation, AVM, which had formed in her brain. Both are outstanding people who have supported the National Stroke Foundation's call for action and its eight particular calls. I have spoken to the member for Dickson, the shadow minister for health, to express my support for the call to action and for the $198 million package of measures which has been called for to increase our ability as a community to support those who have a stroke and ensure their better treatment.</span>

        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Victorian Liberal-National coalition came to power in 2010, all work at the school has come to a grinding halt. The Victorian coalition government has failed to fund and construct the fifth and final stage of Mount Ridley College, meaning that year 10 students are being forced to be accommodated in second-hand portables. Stage 5 of the master plan would include construction of much-needed teaching and learning spaces for the college's senior students in years 10 to 12, as well as counselling and administrative space.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Mount Ridley College prides itself on the innovative teaching and learning programs it has developed. It is held in very high regard in the local and wider community. The school council is deeply upset that its VCE students next year will not have the opportunity to learn in proper dedicated teaching spaces. This year the school has 392 students, who would use the facilities if they were available. By 2015, the stage 5 facilities are supposed to accommodate in excess of 800 students when the senior school becomes fully operational. Despite numerous attempts in correspondence with the Victorian Minister for Education Martin Dixon, his government has consistently failed to provide any confirmation of when the construction of the final stages of the school will commence. In fact, the minister has stated there are no plans to build stage 5.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Alarmingly the placement of year 10 students in second-hand portables has caused a number of issues. Students are not experiencing the delivery of the innovation programs as the portables do not allow for flexible learning spaces, and integrity of the college's teaching and learning programs has been severely compromised because of this. The fantastic staff of Mount Ridley College have noticed a disconnection with year 10 student engagement levels with other students. These have dropped off, along with a sense of belonging, as the seniors now get moved around, with no core facilities. The lack of senior school facilities is also having an impact on the parents of current and prospective students. Many parents are openly questioning whether the school will be ready prior to their child's year 12 graduation.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with Traci Coe, the school council president, who said:</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
          <span class="HPS-Small">The needs and visions of a school do not alter despite the changes in government. Mount Ridley P-12 College remains committed to continuing to offer the best innovative teaching and learning programs. Our community, like all school communities, is entitled to have its building program completed in a timely manner. </span>

          <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Canning Electorate: NBN in Boddington</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">
            <a href="PK6" type="MemberSpeech">
              <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RANDALL</span>
            </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  Today I would like to raise the issue of the NBN rollout in the Shire of Boddington in the Canning electorate. This regional shire at its council meeting on February 19 rejected the planning application for an NBN fixed wireless tower. Many local residents raised concerns about the visual amenity the tower would impose as well as the potential health impacts. Residents felt that the location for the tower was simply not right and the community questioned the amount of planning done by NBN Co. and the government. They simply could not believe that, in the entire locality of Boddington, only a few square metres of land would be appropriate for a tower.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">One Boddington resident questioned NBN Co. when it conducted a community information session in the town. They asked, 'Why can't we get optic fibre, as it runs to Narrogin? Wouldn't it go past Boddington so we could connect in?' NBN did not know. The resident also said, 'Blocks were subdivided above Hotham Avenue and they were required to have pits and trenches for these optic cables before sale. If they were not going to be utilised, why did they have to be constructed?' The NBN did not know.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the shire understands Boddington is the only 'super town' that would not be serviced with fibre, seeing this as a missed opportunity for the growth and viability of the area. Furthermore, Boddington is a town already serviced with ADSL2+ through the soon-to-be-obsolete copper network. By replacing the current ADSL2+ with the proposed NBN fixed wireless, we could see internet speeds reduced from around 20 megabits per second to 12 megabits per second respectively. While the coalition supports the provision of fast broadband on an equitable basis to Australian homes and businesses, a project of this size and scale deserves proper planning and adequate consideration when making these decisions.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">NBN planning is a big issue in my electorate. I have metropolitan areas within the electorate, hills, regional areas and plenty of apartment-style buildings, all dictating unique planning challenges. While only seven per cent of homes and businesses nationally are to get fixed wireless or satellite services via the NBN, in Canning these wireless technologies could be delivered to around 45 per cent of localities. NBN Co. originally promised that towns with 1,000 people would receive fibre, but last year it changed the goal posts and said it was only towns with 1,000 or more premises that would get fibre to the home. When NBN Co. made this decision it meant that up to 400 towns in regional Australia were no longer on the government's list of places to receive fibre. Boddington is one of those towns affected by this change. The shire would like to request the NBN Co. to review its technical information to address any constraints in servicing Boddington and nearby rural living areas with optic fibre to the premises. I will work with the shire and support them on this matter to try and get a proper outcome.</span>

        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">
            <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
              <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
            </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  Could I begin, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, by saying 'Happy birthday' to you and the rest of the ACT. You don't look a day over 99!</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak about an important matter in the electorate of Moreton. I share one-quarter of my electorate with state Liberal National Party member Scott Emerson, who is the Minister for Transport and Main Roads. In July last year he announced a review of the bus network. This overhaul of Queensland bus services will mean cuts to routes, reduced frequency and fewer weekend and evening services. The Newman government has not properly consulted with the community about cuts to their local services. Additionally, any reduction in the frequency of local services will hurt those most in need of reliable bus services, including pensioners, commuters, low-income families and students. I suspect it is actually part of a program for privatisation: you get rid of the routes with lower patronage, increase the number of people in the big bus services and then privatise and sell off the services. These are buses that belong to the people of Brisbane and were paid for by the people of Brisbane.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Sue from my electorate uses the bus service daily to and from work. She is one of the people affected by the up to 30 routes that are to be cut. She has petitioned against the changes as they will put more cars on the road, adding to congestion and pollution. Sam already suffers from peak hour traffic and has petitioned against the cuts to services, but he also calls on the state government to make these services more affordable. Jacinta is petitioning to have community consultation about the removal of public transport. These are people who have contacted me, a federal member, about a local government issue that is also a state government issue, because the state government has signed off on these cuts.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Bus service cuts affect the entire community, whether people use the services to get home late at night after a few drinks or to get to and from work each day or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Good public transport connects communities, and I do declare an interest because there is a bus service right outside my door that is about to be cut. Public transport is there to serve the public. For pensioners and students on the south side, these services are often their only means of transport. I know the suburb of Acacia Ridge in my electorate has identified the changes that will have significant effects on the communities as they rely on these services to visit doctors, to get to work, to go to meetings with employment agencies and to go to Medicare offices. The 192 bus service is an essential service for those travelling to and from the PA Hospital.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Constituents all across my electorate have been calling, emailing and talking at street stalls to me, expressing serious concerns about the changes. I commend another state member in my electorate, Jackie Trad, who is launching a petition to the Newman government asking for further consultation before anything else is cut. In less than a week, over 1,000 people have signed the petition, but neither the state nor the council LNP governments are listening to their voters. In fact, an independent councillor in my electorate, Nicole Johnston, mentioned today that in the public committee meeting she was at today she tried to raise this review of the TransLink bus services, but the councillor in charge insisted on talking on the history of steam ferries rather than the cuts to buses. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

            </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I would like to refer to a cartoon in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> today about why Labor lost so badly in Western Australian. The answer was 'The Liberals didn't give us a fair go—they didn't remove their Premier in his first term,' so it was unfair to the Labor Party and it went from that position of unfairness. Quite often the cartoonists send a message to us that we can accept with a smile on our face but, in truth, is exactly right. Because I am a close friend of the former Premier of Victoria, it is only natural that I am going to speak about this person. As I have said publicly before, decency delivers no dividends. This man was a decent man, a very honest man and a man who put family, the Liberal Party, the state of Victoria and its people first before his own political best interests.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
          <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, it is interesting to look at the coverage of the event in the newspapers. There is a clear lack of knowledge by the journalists of what actually happened. The only person who would know what actually happened would be the former Premier himself—perhaps the current Premier, Denis Napthine, and I wish him all the best, and some others. Clearly, from the reports written by the journalists in our national newspapers, in our state newspapers and in any blog around the place to my knowledge, they had absolutely no idea of what went on and what the Premier was faced with.</span>

One hundred years ago, the ceremony to officially name our capital city was attended by Lord and Lady Denman, and today it was overseen by Their Excellencies the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, and Mr Michael Bryce. Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard was standing where a century ago Labor Prime Minister Andrew Fisher stood. Where the legendary King O'Malley stood 100 years ago, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean, stood.

There were no proper roads. Dignitaries were transported by horse along dusty roads. Today we looked out on a beautiful and flourishing city that has well and truly fulfilled the plans of Walter and Marion Griffin.</span>

Like so many, celebrating our birthday just reminds us of the vibrant community that we have here in Canberra, and as the chair of ActewAGL, Michael Costello, said yesterday at the Spiegel Garden, 'Today we celebrate our community, but we also celebrate our country. It is a country, a democracy, that has been created free of civil war, and it is housed in this, our wonderful capital, our wonderful Canberra.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  Before I make my remarks in this particular bill, can I also join members and senators in this place in wishing Canberra a very happy birthday. I went to high school in Canberra, both to Campbell High and to the fantastic Dickson College where I finished very early on in the years when the college system began, and Dickson College is still a remarkable place of education in this city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The intent of this bill is to improve the administration of the Higher Education Loan Program in line with some of the proposals put forward in the post-implementation review on VET FEE-HELP in 2011. The post-implementation review made a number of sound recommendations—a number of these were introduced to parliament last year—seeking to further increase the number of registered training providers who are eligible to offer VET FEE-HELP courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition recognises the important role that income-contingent loans can play in vocational education. Under the Howard government, income-contingent loans were extended to full-fee-paying students in higher education courses through FEE-HELP in 2005, and they flowed through to the vocational sector to vocational education and training—that is, VET—to VET FEE-HELP in 2008. Of course, income-contingent loans under the previous name of HECS in higher education courses have been around for some 25 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP has enabled thousands of Australians the chance to access an education that they might otherwise not have been able to do. It has enabled them the financial assistance that they need to fund the course of their choosing. But the reality is that the take-up rate of VET FEE-HELP has been well below expectations. There is a range of requirements that providers must meet in order to be able to offer VET FEE-HELP courses. Regrettably, these requirements have proven too onerous for the vast majority of providers. Of the approximately 2,000 providers who offer diploma and advanced diploma courses only 112 are currently approved as VET FEE-HELP providers. This places serious limitations on the ability of students to access income-contingent loans to fund their qualifications, and, as we know, the cost of those qualifications is increasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, a quarter of 20- to 24-year-olds were not in full-time education or work. So many of these young people, who are not currently in work or training, come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and they struggle to afford to study at all. Access to income-contingent loans in VET or higher education qualifications is crucial to assist these young people in finding a course of study and a career path by boosting equity of access and affording them the opportunity for a better life. There is also an economic argument in favour of increasing access to income-contingent loans. Many of the courses that could be funded by FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP are in areas of skill shortages, and we potentially have a future workforce impeded only by the cost of study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the acknowledgment made in the post-implementation review regarding the low take-up of VET FEE-HELP, a number of recommendations were made to improve the overall administration of the Higher Education Loans Program. As a result of these recommendations, this bill seeks to achieve the following. Schedule 1 of this bill allows for the automatic revocation of a provider's registration as an approved higher education or vocational education provider, where the provider has either had their registration cancelled by the relevant tertiary regulator or been deemed unable to operate by a court of law. Schedule 2 of the bill will see providers able to change their name where there is no change of legal entity. As the system currently stands, if a provider changes the name yet the legal entity remains the same, the provider is required to be reapproved as a new applicant. In order to ensure that students are not adversely affected, the minister is currently required to revoke the approval of the provider and reapprove the same entity with retrospective application. This is a practical measure, avoiding additional red tape for providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 will enable the minister to issue compliance notices to providers who are failing to comply. Currently the only courses of corrective action available to the minister are to either suspend or evoke approval of a provider or to withhold payment. This schedule provides an alternative measure, ensuring that providers have an opportunity to undertake corrective action and continue to operate without the sanctions that previously were the only available measure and were extremely harsh. Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to update the calculations of HELP repayment thresholds. This has come about as the Australian Bureau of Statistics has decided to publish the average weekly earnings data on a biannual basis, shifting from quarterly. This will ensure that individuals can repay their HELP debt based on more accurately calculated repayment thresholds in accordance with the ABS data. The final amendment will see an update of the qualification definitions in the act to echo changes made to the Australian Qualifications Framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while we welcome this bill and the amendments that it puts forward, I think it is necessary to acknowledge that there have been few such successful measures in the VET space achieved by those opposite. The broader system suffers from an incredible overload of bureaucracy and red tape. We on this side of the House have made it clear that reducing red tape for business and bureaucracy is high on our agenda. The national partnership on VET reform may well be considered to have failed, given the lack of sign-up by three key states. It would be impossible for anyone who enters into the administrative and compliance aspects of vocational education and training in this country to not be completely bamboozled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the coalition supported the extension of income contingent loans to the vocational ed sector, because we have a really strong record in making sure that those who would study vocational education as opposed to higher education—or, in the common lingo, TAFE and training versus university—should have access to exactly the same support, including financial support. But, if the government are serious about this, it has taken them a while to recognise the extraordinarily low take-up—112 providers out of 2,000 who are using the scheme. Although I do not have detailed information, I would suggest that in rushing through the initial piece of legislation there was a failure to follow up, there was a failure to listen and there was a failure to consult. And that failure is written large across the entire government. If the government had been tuned in to the needs of the providers of registered training, as they should have been, they would not have sat on their hands and said, 'Okay, three years later we'll just get the department to do a review and see what the review says.' So three years pass and no-one has any idea that the system is not working, even though the intention might have been good in the first place. As I said, this is the pattern we are seeing in the training arena from the current government time and time again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be watching closely to see if the modest measures that will be achieved by this legislation, which of course we are entirely supportive of, actually make a difference. If they do not, I would suggest to the minister, who is a new minister in this space and a little more engaged than the previous one—and I do not mean that unkindly, but certainly the previous minister seemed to the sector to be rather hands-off—that the minister acts sooner rather than later to hang on to this valuable cohort of students and this valuable group of training providers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The previous speaker talked about the great record of the coalition. She should go north of the Tweed and see the terrible and appalling record of the LNP state government in Queensland. To localise this particular bill, there are two examples from my electorate that I will give the member for Farrer if she wants to have a look at the impact of both sides of politics on education. The University of Southern Queensland is the first, where the Education Gateways Program, the capital infrastructure program, is getting nearly $49 million of federal government funding. More university students than ever are being funded by the federal government, hitting the Bradley target of 40 per cent of people from low socioeconomic backgrounds getting into university. More young people than ever are going to university. The University of Southern Queensland in Springfield has a broader reach and larger footprint than ever before. It is going ahead in leaps and bounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Up the road, however—in fact, beside it—are the Springfield campus and the Bundamba campus of Bremer TAFE. That TAFE is funded almost exclusively by the state LNP government. What have we seen there? Cutbacks to services, cutbacks to courses and cutbacks to funding. We have seen more barriers, more obstacles, being put in place to young people—particularly those from low socioeconomic backgrounds in the Ipswich and West Moreton region—getting access to higher education. We have gotten lectures from those opposite about education funding. Go to my electorate and you will see the difference between what a Labor government will do at a federal level in terms of tertiary education and what a coalition government will do in terms of vocational education and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the member for Farrer: have a look at what the Howard government did in terms of VET education and what they failed to do. We saw fewer students than ever before going to university under them. More than 190,000 students have gone to university under us—more than ever. Have a look at what the coalition government in Queensland has done. She mentioned—and this is referred to in the explanatory memorandum of this bill—the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. These amendments contribute to our commitment given under that agreement. Why do I mention that? It is because the LNP government in Queensland signed up to that national agreement on skills reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation before this chamber makes further improvements to HELP, including VET FEE-HELP, that were signed up to by various Australian governments. In my home state, the minister responsible for employment, training and education, John-Paul Langbroek, has said, 'We're not responsible for training; we are not responsible for tertiary.' The LNP state government has got a task force dealing with the students who go to the sorts of institutions in Queensland that this legislation relates to. Students who go to those TAFE institutions are having the number of campuses cut by that task force from about 82 to 44. In my electorate, we are seeing barriers and obstacles put in the way of students all the time. Courses are being cut. Those opposite come in here and lecture us about what they are doing and say that they will keep an eye on us. Keep an eye on our record, because our record when it comes to tertiary funding is very good compared to that of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, as I said, is a result of COAG's national partnership agreement and is pursuant to recommendations made in the final report of the implementation review of the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme back in September 2011. It also includes other amendments. What this is about is enhancing the quality and accountability of the whole education framework that underpins HELP by making sure that there can be an automatic revocation of providers in circumstances in which there is a risk to public moneys and a high risk to students. We are going to make sure that those educational institutes have integrity and character and can deliver what they say they can. We are going to strengthen the compliance framework underpinning HELP by making sure that a minister can provide a compliance notice to the provider of education services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this so important? It is important because these income-contingent loans are paid to those institutions to help eligible students with their tuition fees to make sure they can get assistance to get through those courses which will give them an opportunity in life and give them a leg-up to make sure they get financial security and achieve all they want in terms of their dreams, aspirations and goals. For kids from poorer backgrounds that is particularly important. If you are a kid from Basin Pocket and you went to the local state primary school, Ipswich East State Primary School, and your parents had never gone to high school or never gone on to university, the idea that you might be able to go somewhere like Bremer TAFE and get a trade or qualification is really critical. This is what this is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention that particular national partnership agreement on skills reform because this legislation comes out of that. What happened in Queensland as result of that? Guess what? There was a program in Queensland that was geared to helping students and geared toward helping the training of young people particularly—8½ thousand of them, according to the Deloitte Access Economics report in July last year—that actually provided assistance to those people who never would have got a job but for the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program put in by the previous Labor government. They put $90 million towards it. Fifty-seven thousand people got jobs as a result of that program. The Queensland government, a week before the evaluation report came out—this is the government that signed up for the national partnership agreement here in April last year—decided they would get rid of this. They got rid of a program a week before the report came out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a report and guess what that report says? It says that 57,000 Queenslanders got jobs in vocational education training by the skilling that the previous government had undertaken. It said there was an additional $6.5 billion in state gross product and gross domestic product to 2020; an additional $1.8 billion in consumption in Queensland and Australia to 2020; an additional $1.2 billion in state tax receipts to Queensland by 2020. That is for $90 million of job training, particularly for disadvantaged people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we provide FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. If we have institutions that are not providing the services, we should clamp down on them. That is what this legislation is about. But why would you close down good institutions that are providing help for young people, particularly disadvantaged young people in my community like BoysTown, who were getting about $154,000; the Salvation Army Canaan School for Training and Development, who are getting $395,000 and $120,000 for two programs; or Worklinks, who got $128,000 for another program; or Riverview Employment and Learning Program through the Riverview Neighbourhood House Association, $147,000; or, indeed, Ipswich City Council, which also got $45,500 for its community literacy program; or Harvest Rain Adult Literacy Project, who got $95,000 for its community literacy program? Why would you close it down? Not a peep from those opposite about those sorts of programs. These are good programs. These people would never, ever get compliance notices by the minister under this legislation before the chamber, but the coalition in Queensland took the opportunity to close down the funding to good providers, taking away billions of dollars from the Queensland economy to save $90 million. The minister has the temerity in Queensland to say that he is not responsible nor is the government of Queensland responsible for training. He has got it in his title! Yet he takes the money away. They are persecuting working-class people in my community, putting barriers and obstacles to training in their way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Good providers will not be affected by this legislation before the chamber. If they are bad providers, then they have compliance notices. We are improving the system, and what the Queensland government should do is reverse these stupid cuts that impact adversely on the Queensland economy and on people in my community. When it comes to Bremer TAFE, they should re-employ those people, put those programs back in place, and get with the program that we need to undertake to make sure that people get jobs, that the economy in Queensland remains sound, and that the unemployment rate can be reduced. So far, we have seen it go up—up, up and up—under the LNP government, all for its obsession for so-called cuts. There has not been a peep, a word or a whisper from any of those opposite. We had sanctimonious unction from the previous speaker about this sort of thing. Come to my electorate and see what your comrades and colleagues in the LNP are doing.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh. The Canberra celebrations have been all too much for you. Congratulations, too. It was a wonderful centenary function this morning and I know you participated with the member for Canberra. Indeed, today is a very important day for Canberrans. Canberrans also understand the need, the necessity and the importance of higher education. Canberra perhaps has more people with degrees per capita than any other capital city in Australia. We know how important a good education is; it is the great enabler.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take issue with the previous speaker, the member for Blair, for his criticism of the shadow minister and, as he called it, her being sanctimonious on the issue. I listened very closely to the member for Farrer, my neighbouring electorate colleague, and I did not think she was sanctimonious at all. In fact, I thought she gave quite a good account of the bill. You would almost think that the coalition was not supporting this legislation from the way the member for Blair has just carried on. Once again, like so many Labor members opposite, he has tried to introduce state issues into what is a federal matter. If he wants to talk about state matters, he only needs to think about the Victorian election in November 2010, New South Wales in March 2011, Queensland in March 2012, the Northern Territory in August 2012, and Saturday's Western Australian election to see that many of the things that his government offers are not in the best interests of this nation and are being rejected by the voters at the ballot box. He should be very careful when he tries to introduce those state issues into what is a federal matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal matter before us is the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. You would almost think that we as a coalition were opposing this bill from the sentiments that the member for Blair expressed and the condemnatory way—the virtual assault—in which he described the things we are proposing and the sorts of things that state governments are doing. These are not even in line with what this legislation is about because those are state matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A post-implementation review of vocational education and training—the Higher Education Loan Program: VET FEE-HELP—was undertaken in 2011. This bill seeks to introduce some of the recommendations made. This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to enable the strengthening of compliance and accountability frameworks for VET FEE-HELP and FEE-HELP loans. The amendments also improve transparency between the tertiary education regulators and allow for more efficient administrative arrangements when changing business entity names of approved providers. So, there, I agree with what is proposed. The coalition is in support of what is being proposed. I am really at a loss to understand why the member for Blair continued his rant in the way that he did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2005, income contingent loans were extended to full-fee paying students in higher education courses through FEE-HELP under the Howard coalition government. In 2008, income contingent loans were extended to the vocational education sector in the form of VET FEE-HELP. These loans ensure students wishing to pursue a vocation can be provided with financial assistance similar to that on offer to university students through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. The Howard Liberal-Nationals government recognised the importance of vocations and higher education and of enabling people to have the assistance they require, through tertiary and vocational supporting programs, to get the best job and realise their full potential. Certainly it was done then. The Labor government now says it is doing the same. When it comes up with a proposal or a plan that the coalition can see will be beneficial to those people looking to better themselves, we are in agreement with it. The loan may cover or partially cover the tuition costs for the VET course, however, VET FEE-HELP is not available for Certificates I to IV and students are required to repay their loan once their income exceeds the minimum repayment level, which is $49,096 for 2012-13.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order for students to be able to access these loans, their registered training organisation needs to have approval to offer VET FEE-HELP. The eligibility criteria for offering VET FEE-HELP includes a provider being a body corporate with the principal purpose of offering education, proving their financial viability, having central management based in Australia, offering VET accredited diploma and advanced diploma courses, with credit transfer arrangements in place, and being a member of an approved tuition assurance scheme, or have exemption from this requirement. Of the 2,000 or so providers who offer diploma and advanced diploma courses, only 112 are currently approved as VET FEE-HELP providers. That was certainly brought out in the speech earlier this afternoon of the member for Farrer, the shadow minister. As a result, the take-up of VET FEE-HELP has been low, with only 39,124 students accessing VET FEE-HELP assistance in 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that the intent of extending income contingent loans to the VET sector was done largely to alleviate the inequity of access, it is apparent there is considerably more work to do. In addition there are some major areas of skill shortages which could be addressed by ensuring that the organisations which offer these qualifications are VET FEE-HELP eligible. When I speak of inequity of access, that is certainly a factor in regional areas. Because of a lack of all sorts of services and support programs students in regional areas have a more difficult job of actually gaining tertiary education and better vocations than do people in metropolitan areas and people in your own electorates and here in Canberra. That is why I know the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional education, Senator Fiona Nash, has been so strident in her advocacy for independent youth allowance. Whilst that is not part of this bill, it is something that is important and imperative for regional students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this particular bill is intended to bolster the accountability frameworks for FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. These amendments specifically will enable the automatic revocation of registered training organisations' approval as a higher education or vocational education provider when any of the following have occurred: the relevant tertiary regulator has ceased the provider's registration; a court has made an order to wind up a provider; or ASIC has determined they can no longer operate. Until such time as all paths of appeal have been exhausted the provider will continue to be registered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendments in schedule 2 of the bill would allow the minister to change the name of the entity for HELP purposes through one legislative instrument, but only in cases where there has been no change in legal ownership. Currently, if a provider changes their name yet the legal entity remains the same, the provider is required to be re-approved as a new applicant would be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to ensure that students are not adversely affected—and this is most important, because the last thing we need is for levels of bureaucracy to be affecting students when they need to get on with the job of learning—the minister is currently required to revoke the approval of the provider and reapprove the same entity with retrospective application. Therefore, the entity would no longer be required to reapply and go through a duplicate approval process, which is currently the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill will enable additional flexibility for managing provider noncompliance. Currently, the act has limited options available for the management of noncompliance by providers. As it stands, the only options available to the minister are to either revoke or suspend the approval of a higher educational or VET provider or to withhold provider payments. These actions may be excessive for many administrative breaches. Under these amendments, there will be provision for a provider to be given a compliance notice which specifies the breach, the corrective action required and the time frame for this to be undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to update the calculation of HELP repayment thresholds. This has become necessary as average weekly earnings data is determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics data. This data was published quarterly; however, it is now published biannually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 of the bill deals with other amendments and will see the consolidation of provisions related to the government's ability to seek information from relevant tertiary education regulators in the one division. These will improve the transparency—and we all want greater transparency—with the relevant tertiary education regulators and enhance arrangements to identify at-risk providers. Additionally, there have been changes to definitions to incorporate changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework. These changes will help to enhance the quality and accountability frameworks underpinning the higher education loan program, will enable the government to better manage risk to students and public moneys and will effectively and flexibly respond to low-quality providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to enabling universities and other support mechanisms for students to gain better vocations, I am on record thanking and praising the government for initiatives which have helped Charles Sturt University, whose Wagga Wagga campus is in my electorate. I attended the opening of the life sciences hub along with the Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills, the member for Cunningham. It is a tremendous facility and it will do so much not only for this nation but for regional Australia and for the Riverina electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, there is a push in Wagga Wagga for a rural medical school. I know that the relevant ministers are well aware of this, and it is something I will certainly be pushing. I know how important these rural medical schools are to the recruitment and retention of doctors in regional areas. There are proposals being put forward by the University of New South Wales and Charles Sturt University. I am in support of those proposals. A collaborative effort, a whole-of-government approach, is something that would be very beneficial to Wagga Wagga, to the Riverina, to country New South Wales and to the nation. I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this bill. The coalition supports this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  At the outset, I acknowledge the comments of the member for Riverina, who has demonstrated his passion for his constituents with his ability to speak for an appropriate length about an issue of importance to him and to the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased when I was an academic at the ANU to work alongside Bruce Chapman, one of the architects of HECS, who put in place a truly world-leading piece of policy. It is easy to forget now that HECS, now known as HELP, has become so much a part of our social fabric. The notion of income-contingent loans was one in which Australia was stepping out as a world first. Milton Freeman mentioned the notion of income-contingent loans in the 1960s but it was Professor Chapman who really picked it up, put flesh on its bones and suggested it as a way of ensuring two big things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first was that, because with a university education there is the private benefit to the student as well as the public benefit, they should contribute a little bit back into the public purse. University education boosts earnings significantly, and HECS, now HELP, recognises that private benefit. But, secondly, it was the recognition that we needed to expand the sector. We needed to ensure that university education was not something just for elites but was attainable for all Australians. The only way of getting those additional resources into the sector was to ask students to give a little bit back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So now, when we look at policies in which Australia is leading the world I think we should also look to the HELP policy—a policy which has proven its worth and is now being adopted by a suite of other countries around the world. The UK, Germany, Israel, Thailand and Chile are all adopting or looking at adopting the HELP policy. I suspect that will be the case down the track with policies such as plain packaging of tobacco and putting a price on carbon pollution—we are moving with other countries in the world to put in place policies that future generations will thank us for. What we are doing with this policy is ensuring that the thresholds are indexed at appropriate levels. When HECS was originally introduced, repayment did not start until you reached average weekly earnings. That was based on the simple notion that you should not have to pay back your HECS debt until your university education had begun to pay off in earnings for you. When the Howard government came to office, that model was changed and the repayment thresholds were brought down substantially. I am pleased that now the HECS repayment threshold have been restored so that they are around average weekly earnings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a part of a major university investment by this government. Since Labor has come to office there have been more than 150,000 extra Australians studying at university and total funding for the sector has been increased substantially. At the Australian National University, just to pick one of the many excellent universities in my electorate, there has been an increase in enrolments from 6,350 students to 7,086 students, significant investment in education and significant investment in improving access to youth allowance and the quality of student learning and living areas through our investment in housing. That matters, because high-quality university accommodation improves the learning experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, we had the ANU alumni awards recognising extraordinary alumni. I acknowledge Alumni of the Year joint recipients Anne Gallagher and Martin Parkinson; Vice-Chancellor's Special Commendations Adam Ford, Danny Bishop and Chris Duffield; International Alumnus of the Year Cheong Choong Kong; Young Alumnus of the Year joint recipients Sebastian Robertson and Jennifer Robinson; Student of the Year joint recipients Katrina Marson and Ray Lovett; and Student of the Year finalists Aditya Chopra, Julie Melrose and Georgia Majoribanks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I also note some important reforms being put in place by the government in teacher education courses. This government recognises that it is important to improve the academic aptitude of new teachers. When I was at the Australian National University I did work with Chris Ryan looking at the academic aptitude of new teachers and those entering tertiary education, and what we found was deeply disturbing. From 1983 through to 2003 the share of teachers who were in the top fifth of their class measured on literacy and numeracy had halved. Over the same period, the share of teachers who were in the bottom half of their class had doubled. So we had seen a fall in the academic aptitude of new teachers from the 70th percentile to the 62nd percentile, and we had seen a fall in the academic aptitude of those entering teacher education courses from the 74th percentile to the 61st percentile. It is a development that had also been seen over that period in the United States and it is a development that concerns this government. Literacy and numeracy does not guarantee you are going to be a great teacher but, all else equal, we want those who are at the whiteboard to have strong literacy and numeracy standards themselves. So, as the minister has announced, we will be putting in place literacy and numeracy testing, a more targeted admission process for teaching courses and more assistance to help all teachers over every stage of their career, recognising that there is no more important job in Australia than teaching students, particularly disadvantaged students. With those remarks, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

The Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013 provides legislative authority for the Australian government's Higher Education Loan Program, or HELP. FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assist individuals to access higher education and higher level vocational training by providing students with income-contingent loans to assist them in paying their tuition fees. By accessing HELP, students do not have to make any loan repayments until their income reaches a minimum threshold—currently $49,096. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds on the amendments made in the Higher Education Support Amendments (Streamlining and Other Measures) Act 2012 and supports recommendations made in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">mplementation </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview of the VET FEE-HELP </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ssistance </span><span style="font-style:italic;">scheme—f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">inal </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport September 2011</span>.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will enhance the quality and accountability framework underpinning HELP by providing for the automatic revocation of providers in specific circumstances where there is a risk to students and public moneys. This will occur only after all appeal and review mechanisms have been finalised. The amendments will also enhance the government's ability to protect the integrity of HELP by improving the range of provider compliance mechanisms available to the government. The existing arrangements for seeking information from the relevant tertiary education regulators will be further enhanced by consolidating these provisions into one general provision. The amendments will also streamline administrative arrangements for changes to business entity names for approved providers. Further, the bill will enable individuals to continue to repay their HELP debt based on appropriately calculated repayment thresholds by updating the calculation of indexation to apply to HELP repayment thresholds. This amendment reflects the move by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from quarterly to biannual publication of average weekly earnings data. Finally, amendments will provide consistency across the tertiary sector by updating qualification definitions in the act to align with changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework. I commend this bill, and its purpose to strengthen and enhance the government's income-contingent loans program, to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  It is fitting that we discuss the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill 2013 on the day that Canberra celebrates its centenary. This bill is very timely, because it enhances the ability of the ACT assembly to be the master of its own destiny, and I think that is a reasonable aspiration for the parliament here within the ACT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred years ago in 1913, Lady Denman, who was wife of the then Governor-General, Lord Denman, stood upon the newly laid foundation stone and announced that the name of the new Australian capital would be Canberra. In an article by Ian Warden that was featured in the Canberra Times today, he described it as such: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The site that people descended on for the day (VIPs coming on special trains from Sydney and Melbourne to Queanbeyan from whence they were taken on in a fleet of new-fangled horseless carriages) was totally pastoral. There were just 1700 people in the federal territory, hopelessly outnumbered by 320,000 sheep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Warden notes, spine tinglingly, that the name chosen by cabinet had not been leaked, and that the public had deluged the Department of Home Affairs with 750 suggested names, such as Eros, Cooee, Swindleville and Kangaremu. Those were discounted by the cabinet at the time but there were some other names that were taken seriously such as Federata, Parkes, Myola and, interestingly enough, Shakespeare. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the name of Canberra was chosen by the cabinet. That word is a derivation of an Aboriginal word Kamberra which means meeting place. As was noted by the Prime Minister quite aptly today in her comments about the centenary of Canberra, that was quite an interesting decision for a cabinet in 1913 to have taken. I think it fits very well with the nature of our society today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1913 there was nothing much more here than a sheep paddock. In 1927 the capital was moved from Melbourne to Canberra. There would not have been a lot here. There would have just been politicians coming in for, I presume, much lengthier periods of time, given the nature of how difficult it would have been to travel from the various parts of the country then. I reflect about how it must have been then and how it is for us today. As politicians, funnily enough we would spend more time here than anywhere besides our home, but we can have very little interaction with the city. Shamefully, I can say I can come here for weeks on end and not leave the area within walking distance of Canberra Avenue. But I do actually know the city very well because I studied at the ANU. I was a little disappointed to be missed when the member for Fraser was going through the significant alumni. I assume that I will appear at some stage on that list. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that we can interact very little with the city itself but I have the privilege of knowing the city very well because I have lived here for many years. I studied here and I subsequently worked here. I have been down to Tuggeranong and Belconnen and Woden. It is perhaps a shame that, when we come here for work for lengthy periods of time, we just do not get out to see the sorts of delights that Canberra does have to offer. I offer my personal congratulations to Canberrans on what is a very significant event in the life of their city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The capital was administered by the national government up until 1989 and Canberrans were very reluctant to embrace self-government. Indeed, it came eventually after asking Canberrans whether they wanted it and Canberrans consistently saying no. The Hawke government at the time just insisted and passed the self-government act in 1989. It took a while for Canberrans to seriously embrace self-government. Prior to that, all the decisions had been made by the minister for territories. I think that was a good decision by the Hawke government to give the ACT self-government. I do not think it was necessarily that great to be administered directly by one federal government minister, even though there were advisory bodies that had been set up to advise that minister of matters of concern for residents of the ACT. Those advisory committees had existed since 1920 and were initially made up of appointed officials until some of them started to be elected in 1928 and in 1930 an ACT advisory council was established to advise the minister on matters that directly affected Canberrans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first fully elected body, the Legislative Assembly, originally consisted of 18 members and began operating in 1974. That is an interesting number to ponder because the current assembly only has 17 members, so it has less than that original advisory committee that was established in 1974 when Canberra would have been a significantly smaller place. The name was officially changed from the Legislative Assembly to the House of Assembly in 1979. However, the federal government was under no obligation to take the advice that was given by any of the appointed or elected bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An advisory referendum, or plebiscite, was held on 25 November 1978 to ask residents whether the ACT should be granted self-government. A resounding 63½ per cent of electors voted against Canberra being granted self-government. So it was not until the late 1980s that the then Hawke government decided that the Australian Capital Territory with a population of 270,000 people did need its own system of self-administration. Then the federal parliament passed the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 along with other related legislation which established self-government in the ACT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notably, however, section 122 of the Constitution allows the Commonwealth to override a territory law at any time. The Commonwealth has used its power under section 122 on a few occasions only and in cases where the territory law has created much debate or controversy within the Australian community. I think that is right. I think that for one parliament, where the federal parliament overrides the wishes of another democratically elected parliament, the circumstances need to be extremely dire for that course of action to be warranted. Once a territory has been given self-government and once they elect their own officials, it is really quite improper in my view—apart from the most extreme circumstances—for another group of elected officials to override the wishes of that lawfully elected parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Up until 2011 the self-government acts covering the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory gave federal ministers the right to veto or change territory laws without referring the matter to the federal parliament. That is quite an extraordinary power for a federal minister, if you think about it, to be able to unilaterally override the wishes of the elected parliament within the ACT or the Northern Territory, and that act has now been amended to remove this veto power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a further enhancement of the ability of the ACT Legislative Assembly to set its own course, and in this case it has set the course about how many elected officials should sit within the Legislative Assembly. It is a unicameral legislature. All states with the exception of Queensland have two houses of parliament from which to draw a cabinet and the expertise. Seventeen members of parliament for a city of 325,000—</span>

                    </a>  375,000 in Canberra! It has grown rapidly! I think Tasmania has about 500,000 and so you can see that Canberrans, funnily enough, as the seat of the federal parliament, are not overly represented by their own politicians. It makes sense that if it is the will of the Assembly to expand the number of politicians within that Assembly, that they should be allowed to do so, and it is my understanding that both of the major parties represented in the Assembly wish to do this. It seems highly likely that they will vote—and they will need a two-thirds majority under this legislation—to increase the number of members within the Assembly itself and, if they feel that that is the appropriate course of action, then they should be entitled to do that and this legislation will enable them to do just that. This bill will change the mechanism by which the size of the Assembly can be adjusted. It does not itself make any changes to the size of the Assembly, but it will leave that now within the hands of the Assembly itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I wish to point out the very good work that the one opposition representative within the coalition party room representing the ACT, Senator Gary Humphries, does on behalf of his constituents, which are all the people of Canberra. He has had a very distinguished political career in the ACT parliament where he was Deputy Chief Minister and subsequently served as Chief Minister. He has served his city with great distinction. Clearly, sometimes he has been at odds with some of his colleagues within the coalition party room about what he believes is an appropriate course of action for his community. I respect him greatly for the efforts that he has gone to to stand up for his community. I have seen him take on the vast majority of the party room when he believes the interests of Canberra are being threatened. I have not necessarily agreed with his positions but he has been a very strong and vocal advocate for his constituents. I just want to note that here today, because it is a great privilege to work with Gary both as the one opposition representative for the ACT but also somebody who works within my portfolio areas as well. He is an exceptionally capable and intelligent member of the upper chamber. In this centenary year of the ACT, he will hold a significant place within the history of the self-governing territory. I wanted to acknowledge that here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, in the centenary year of Canberra it is appropriate that the Legislative Assembly of the ACT be allowed to set its own destiny in regard to it size. The opposition therefore supports this bill. I note that it has had the strong support of both of the major parties within the assembly. It is right that the federal parliament pass it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill 2013 today, the 100th birthday of Canberra. This morning we had a re-enactment out the front of Parliament House of the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone. I have here the program for that ceremony, which was held on 12 March 1913. Today's ceremony aimed to shadow that historic ceremony of 1913, when sheep greatly outnumbered the residents of Canberra. The ceremony this morning acknowledged the rich history of Canberra—not only the political heritage but also the social tapestry of the city. I was very pleased today to hear the member for Stirling speak so warmly of the city that I have the honour to represent in the federal parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Walter Burley Griffin said that he was designing a city for a nation of 'bold democrats'. To borrow a phrase from Seamus Heaney, I have always thought of Canberra as being the kind of place where hope and history rhyme. In the centenary celebrations, Canberra has been given an opportunity to celebrate but also to remember much of our history. Historian David Headon has produced a series of centenary booklets and centenary director Robyn Archer has made sure that history has been interwoven into the celebrations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also taken the opportunity to invest in the city of Canberra. The Australian government has contributed $20 million to the development of a visitors centre, a children's play space, ceremonial gardens, an events pavilion and an events terrace at the National Arboretum. In building the National Arboretum, we really are reaching out to the generations to come, because arboretums often involve planting saplings that will only become great trees once we have shuffled off this mortal coil.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also an opportunity for communities to come together. One of my regrets about today is that I am missing out on the street parties that are being held throughout my electorate. The parties in Lyneham and Hackett in particular are ones that I would have looked forward to attending. They are in fact going on at this very moment. They are bringing together communities to have a bit of fun and enjoy their history.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my contributions to the celebrations has been through the celebrity suburb name competition, which involves thinking about who or what your suburb might have been named after if you had particularly wicked ancestors. For example, Cook might have been named after <span style="font-style:italic;">Master Chef</span>, Dunlop after tyres, Latham after Mark Latham, Reid after Chopper Reid, Russell after Russell Crowe and of course Scullin after the Oarsome Foursome.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an extraordinary city to live in and to represent. Ours is the bush capital, where you can look up and see hills from inside a shopping centre. There are plenty of cockatoos and magpies and, yes, even galahs. When the scoping party visited Canberra in August 1906, a newspaper reported wrote: 'A deep breath of the air is like a draft of champagne.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra is Australia's sporting capital. We have the Australian Institute of Sport and a plethora of great sporting teams—the Comets, the Brumbies, the Raiders, the Capitals, Cavalry, Strikers, Knights, Lakers and GWS. But we also play more sport than people in other parts of Australia. Four out of 10 Canberrans play an organised sport compared with three out of 10 for the rest of Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra is Australia's ideas capital. Wi-Fi was invented at CSIRO. Our most recent Nobel laureate is Brian Schmidt, the ANU researcher, who won a Nobel Prize for his research on the expanding universe. We also have ideas generated by the public servants, such as HECS, Medicare, universal superannuation and plain packaging. We have social entrepreneurs in Canberra who are inspirational for the rest of the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also the country's history capital. We are not the oldest city in Australia but we are the only capital city in Australia named after the traditional owners rather than one of the white interlopers. All around us the nation's history is the local geography for Canberra—suburbs from Deakin to Curtin, Scullin to Chifley. In fact, the only one you feel sorry for is Prime Minister Gorton, the only Prime Minister to make Canberra his home after retirement but who missed having a suburb named after himself because the planners wanted to avoid confusion with 'Gordon'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also Australia's social capital. Walter Burley Griffin wanted ours to be a community with 'great democratic civic ideals', and I think he would be pleased to know that Canberrans are more likely to volunteer than people in other parts of Australia and more likely to donate money to a charity. They are more likely to trust others and to join community organisations. Part of that is not just the fact that Canberrans are, on average, a touch better educated and a touch more affluent than the rest of Australia, because even when you compare like with like you see that Canberrans are more civically engaged than people of similar demographics. I think it is something to do with the urban design—the fact that in Canberra you do not have to burn a litre of petrol to buy a litre of milk; that you can live in the suburbs but walk to local shops. That means, for example, that a Sydneysider with a full-time job spends 13 days a year commuting—13 24-hour days just sitting in the car. A Canberran with a full-time job spends eight days a year commuting. That is an extra five days a year to spend with friends and family, playing an organised sport or getting involved with family and the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not to say that we should not work to improve Canberra. I do commend the member for Stirling for his bipartisan support for this bill. This bill is a recognition of the work that is being done by ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher appointing an expert reference group to review the size of the ACT Legislative Assembly. That expert reference group comprised ACT Electoral Commissioner Phillip Green, who is the chair; Anne Cahill Lambert; Meredith Edwards; John Hindmarsh; and Louise Taylor. This expert review will look at the number of electorates and the number of members per electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have put a submission into that inquiry because I believe that it is important first and foremost that the assembly be able to set its size, as state parliaments can already do. The ACT assembly, now into its third decade, has proved itself the decision-making equal of any other parliament in Australia and I believe ought to be able to set its own size. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The workload of ACT parliamentarians is significant indeed. A standard rule for the size of an assembly body, if you look across parliaments around the world, is an assembly size of about the cube root of the population it represents. So, for example, if you take Australia's population—23 million—the cube root of 23 million is 284, not far off the 226 members of the Australian parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you take New South Wales, for example, the population is seven million. The cube root of seven million is 191 and the New South Wales parliament has 135 representatives—in the ballpark of what the cube root rule would lead you to expect. But if you apply that to the ACT's population—375,000—you get an assembly size of 72, four times larger than the current assembly. Put another way, you can ask the question: 'If you had an assembly of 17 people, what population size should it represent?' The answer is about 5,000 people, about the population of Palmerston, one of the suburbs in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That may sound ridiculous, but if you look to Norfolk Island, for example, it has a nine-member assembly serving 2,000 people; Wreck Bay in my own electorate, with a population of 200, has a community council of nine people. So the ACT assembly is almost uniquely small for the workload that it deals with. Its current 17 MLAs are particularly hard working. I would particularly acknowledge the numerous mobile offices run by Chris Bourke, Mary Porter, Mick Gentleman and Joy Burch; the doorknocking work of Yvette Berry; and the hectic public speaking schedules of Katy Gallagher, Simon Corbell and Andrew Barr.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is tough to be an MLA in the ACT for two reasons. The first is that the number of people they must represent is large. The second is the number of issues are vast, because there is no local council here, unlike, say, the Northern Territory or Tasmania. The work of the assembly ranges from everything from schools to garbage collection. The result of having a 17-member assembly is that government members who are in the ministry can hold between four and six ministries. These are exceptionally high workloads and they are replicated among the shadow ministers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth pointing out that not only does the assembly represent a very large number of people for its size but that it is also true of federal electorates. My own electorate of Fraser now has 131,698 people on the electoral roll. That is either the largest or the second largest of any of the 150 members in the House of Representatives. At the last federal election the average number of electors per electorate was 94,000. But at current rates of population growth it does not look as though the ACT will receive a third seat in the House of Representatives. That then expands the workload on the ACT's House of Representatives members. We deal with a considerable number of local queries and I believe that the representation of the ACT population would be improved were we to have a larger assembly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The assembly size is for the assembly, but my own view is that increasing the assembly to 25 MLAs—five electorates each returning five members—is the minimum that ought to be considered. That would be still well below the ratio of members per population that other states and territories have. In fact, it would only provide a level of representation comparable to 1989, when the territory first attained self-government. I do think that the territory, were it to go to only 25 members, should do so in conjunction with a commitment to steadily increase the assembly size as the population of the ACT grows. I think that would be appropriate, given the extremely large workload of the assembly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So while I commend my assembly colleagues on their hard work, I do hope that there will be bipartisan support for this. I was very pleased to hear the member for Stirling speaking of the federal coalition's bipartisan support. But I am aware that there are always temptation to play politics with this. I can see the temptation that the ACT Liberals may face, where they decide that they can run some sort of cheap, populist line of saying that they are going to vote against extra politicians. While it might be in their immediate political interest, it would not be in the long-term interests of the ACT, and I do urge them to place those long-term interests first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I make mention of a great Canberran, CEO of the ACT and Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chris Peters. Chris passed away on 27 February this year. He had a ready smile, a generosity of spirit and a willingness to engage in public debates on matters large and small in the ACT. His commitment to building this great city, I think, will live on beyond him. He is known as a great advocate for business in Canberra, and having great advocates for business—as I know the member for Canberra is and as am I—is so important to ensuring that this diverse city does well in its second century. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

I do feel a bit like the town crier of birthday felicitations as I spoke earlier in the chamber to wish Wollongong headspace a happy fifth birthday and I have great pleasure in summing this bill up and wishing Canberra a happy 100th birthday today, so it is a great day to be speaking in the chamber. I also acknowledge the two speakers before me, the members for Stirling and Fraser, and I am sure in the great tradition of bipartisan reaching across the aisles they will, in a particularly positive manner, resolve the contentious issue of the member for Stirling as an ANU illustrious alumni in his assessment and make the member for Fraser's list in the future. I am sure they will resolve that matter.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is appropriate that the bill be debated in the House today as it is the 100th anniversary of the laying of a foundation stone and the proclamation of the name of Canberra. Earlier today, as the previous speakers outlined, at the front of this building, the Prime Minister and the minister for regional Australia were joined by the Governor-General, representatives from all parties, Indigenous elders and a live television audience for a ceremony at Canberra's foundation stone. The leaders of 100 years ago came to Canberra's naming ceremony with the same enthusiasm, pride and optimism for the future that still drives us today. In many ways, the city's development has mirrored the nation's into a confident and vibrant place, nurturing the Australian sense of community and building resilience for the challenges of the future. Canberra is home to the institutions of Australian democracy and to many of the historical and cultural collections that tell our national story. The city should be and is a source of pride for all Australians. Regional Australia Minister, Simon Crean, said that the legacy of Canberra's founders would be strongly felt as it continued into its second century.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the bill today that reflects on the maturity of this city-state. The purpose of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill 2013 is to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 to grant the ACT Legislative Assembly the power to determine its size. Currently, the process to change the number of members of the assembly requires a resolution to be passed by the assembly and then for regulations to be made by the Commonwealth and agreed to by the assembly. A now mature parliament, self-governing for more than 20 years, should not require the permission of another parliament to adjust itself to meet changing demands over time. The passage of the bill will provide just recognition of the maturity and capacity of the ACT Legislative Assembly demonstrated since it has attained self-government. What the passage of this bill does not represent is a change in the size of the assembly, only the mechanism by which change can occur if desired by the assembly. Nor does the bill represent a panacea to any particular issues that the assembly may face. I am sure all members will agree that it is a fitting act on this historic day, a celebration of the 100 years of the capital, that we support this bill, and I commend it to the House.</span>

This was a large bushfire which had to be brought under control using fixed-wing aircraft and CFA, DSC and SES crews. It was a major operation and everyone involved did a sensational job, first, to contain this fire in what was a large area. Much of the area where the fire was burning is inaccessible, yet through backburning everyone was able to mount a huge effort to ensure that the fire did not do significant damage. The major damage it did do was to get into a pine plantation where the bill will probably run into millions of dollars, which shows you the significance of being able to bring these types of fires under control quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had the Chepstowe-Carngham fire occur in the electorate of Wannon. This was a completely different fire. This was in farmland. The fire occurred at a rapid rate of knots. It burnt 1,300 hectares of farmland. Nine houses, sadly, were destroyed and it left farms and native forests charred. It also led, as we have seen once again, to great community spirit. Once the fire was finished, once it was over, the community got together and worked out what they needed to do to help those who were impacted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a telling reminder for me as I drove down to fly to Canberra yesterday. As I was driving by in over 30-degree heat in the middle of the day, there were local community members fixing the charred fences which they had removed. There they were on a public holiday Monday putting those fences back together, all volunteering their time to do it for a farmer who had had all the fences destroyed. It is what country communities are all about and it was just very, very humbling to see these people going about their work, chipping in for their local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other fire—and this is a more recent fire that we have had in Wannon—is the one which occurred in the Grampians. Again, this was a significant bushfire. It could have caused extensive damage. It very nearly led to houses being burnt to the ground. It very nearly meant that we saw large portions of farmland destroyed. Once again, the CFA, DSE and the SES did a wonderful job in bringing this fire under control. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the stories of how they did that are quite remarkable. At some stage the fire was sweeping down hills faster than the fire trucks could go. Usually, CFA members will tell you, fires travel quicker uphill than down hills, but in this case, given the steepness of some the country and the ferocity of the wind, this was not the case and the fire was actually moving at a rapid rate down the hills. This gave a new challenge to those that were fighting it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fire has been contained and, once again, the use of fixed-wing aircraft was very important in doing this. I must commend everyone involved in making sure that we had air crews to throw at fires as well as ground crews.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one important point would like to make about all these three fires. This is something that, as lawmakers, we will have to look at seriously. All of these three fires occurred in areas which are mobile black spots—that is, when the fires occurred, community members could not be informed of what was going on quickly by mobile phone and they could not communicate to the outside world what was occurring by mobile phone. One of the great technology uses we now have is the ability for CFA and DSE to alert communities through text to those areas which are potentially being threatened by bushfires. The trouble in these areas was there was no ability to do that because they were in mobile phone black spots. If we are to get serious about warning communities, if we are to get serious about making sure our emergency response services have all the tools available to them then we are going to have to look at mobile phone coverage. This is a real issue. I will just run through some of the areas in my electorate which are mobile phone black spots: Landsborough, Moonambel, Victoria Valley—where the Grampians fire was—Nareen, Tarrayoukyan, Carisbrooke, the outskirts of Marysborough—a town of 9,000 or 10,000 people, Bealiba, Marino, Digby, north of Casterton, Cape Bridgewater, significant areas around Balmoral and Harrow. These are all parts of my electorate which are still lacking proper mobile phone coverage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at this, we are going to have to ask ourselves: if we are going to have a proper emergency response to disasters, is there an obligation for us to look at mobile phone coverage? Is there an obligation for us to make sure that the government contributes to providing mobile phone coverage in areas where the commercial facts mean that the commercial providers will not do this? They will not do it without some sort of government assistance. I think down the track as we see mobile phone coverage spread and the importance of mobile phones not only as a provider of phone coverage but also as a provider of data and a provider of broadband services, we are going to need government to seriously ask these questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a universal service obligation for fixed line telecommunications. Do we now need to look at whether we would want a universal services obligation for the provision of mobile phone coverage? We probably do not have the finances to be able to do this at the moment but this is something that we are going to have to put on the agenda because these communities are missing out on this important technology. When it comes, in particular, to emergency services management, this tool is becoming more and more important. If there is a lesson from my electorate about the three natural disasters which occurred over this summer, it is that we need to look seriously at mobile phone coverage and whether the federal government is doing enough to play its part in warning these communities of the potential of natural disasters. We have to remember it can be a split-second thing which can save property and save lives. If we cannot get the message out to communities that there is the potential for a natural disaster to hit them quickly and rapidly, we put those communities a greater risk of being impacted severely by these natural disasters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will leave it there. On behalf of all the communities in Wannon I would like to place on the record my sincere thanks for the efforts of the CFA, both those who are paid and those who are volunteers, the DSC, the SES, the police and everyone else who was involved in making sure that these fires were contained and eventually put out. I would like to pass on my sincere sadness for those who had their homes burnt, who lost everything in the Chepstowe-Carngham fire. For those farmers who have had their livelihoods impacted on I would like to sincerely thank the VFF and the local branches, who organised to have fences repaired and have the damage done to farms fixed so that those farmers could get on, and, hopefully, once we get rain, see their livelihoods get back on an even keel. Natural disasters have occurred across our nation since time immemorial. They are going to continue to occur. But as we advance as a society we have to make sure we use every tool we can to deal with them.</span>

                  <a href="EM6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr STONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  On indulgence, I also would like to make a statement on Australian natural disasters. We have always been the land of drought and flooding rains. If you have lived in Australia for more than a holiday you will understand this. Add fires, cyclones and the very occasional earthquake, and we do have more than our fair share of natural disasters in this country. Fortunately, in the form of our volunteering we also have an enormous spirit in responding to these natural disasters. We do not just expect the government or the defence forces to come to the aid of those who have been inundated or burnt. We pull together as smaller or larger communities and literally help ourselves, with the support sooner or later of those who have a professional capacity to help. I think it is one of the amazing strengths of our Australian society that these very often unsung heroes come out again and again as the disasters occur year after year, as was the case with the floods in Queensland. During those floods people in very high risk areas were inundated for sometimes the third or fourth time. Again and again the same people come out to help them to mop up and start again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my particular part of Australia, we have a broad set of flat plains. Given our average rainfall of about 15 inches you would not expect that we would be inundated with floods. They have always been a fairly rare event, but over the past two years we have had extraordinary flooding rains. Before our flooding rains, which we have just commemorated—not celebrated, but commemorated—as they occurred one year ago and two years ago almost to the day, in the first weeks of March, we had the worst drought on record, some seven years of heartbreak, when we saw more than 50 per cent of our dairy farms forced to sell their water in order to survive financially. You can imagine that in an area like ours, which is dependent on irrigated agriculture, once you have sold your water you are no longer productive as a dairy farmer enterprise. And of course hanging off our dairy farming are our jobs in food manufacturing, transport and all the other logistical activities that make food manufacturing one of the biggest employers in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Drought first of all occurred in my area as a natural disaster. It was a slow insidious drought that sapped the financial, physical and emotional strength of our families. Then, literally within weeks we saw the worst floods on record in those same formerly drought stricken areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago almost to the day the floods swept across what we call our northern plains. There was a tsunami of water moving from the south to the north pushing before it the fodder and the fences. There was an extraordinary loss of over $2 billion in both private and public infrastructure and assets. Those people, all in tiny communities—the biggest often had only about 2,000 people, some of which are districts and not towns at all—pulled together, saved lives, saved livestock and helped one another to recover by sharing farm equipment. We had farmers walk their dairy cows for seven hours to someone else's dairy, which had not been flooded. The cows stayed there literally for months while the original dairy could be put back into action. We had some loss of life later on when some tragedies occurred as people tried to clean up. In one very tragic circumstance one man fell into a fire he was making from the debris on his farm fences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in the far west of the electorate of Murray, the community's spirit has been extraordinary. I want to reflect on the small town of Bridgewater, which is on the Loddon River. That town was completely inundated, to a depth of over several metres. Their caravan park was washed away and their shops were completely put out of action. You can imagine the distress in the town, given it is a very old, historic place. But I was there just a week ago, and it was like a phoenix risen from the ashes—or, rather, from the mud. That town is now celebrating a new bakery. It has had a huge influx of newcomers, who are going to the bowling club and celebrating the beauty of the town and its recovery from the flood. I have to commend the spirit of that community, who have fought back bravely and strongly. Of course, the Loddon Shire has supported them all the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just 12 months ago we had the flood to the east of the electorate, over what we will call the Goulburn and Murray valleys. These floods occurred particularly in the shire of Moira, where 70 per cent of the entire shire area was devastated. It is the home of some of the best fruit and dairy production in Australia, so you can imagine the impact of these floodwaters not just moving across the country but then settling and staying for six and seven months in some places on what was highly productive land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twelve months after this devastating flood in, for example, the Moira shire, in March 2013, 70 per cent of the repair of roads, bridges and other infrastructure is still not completed. The March 2012 floodwaters destroyed, for example, the Numurkah Hospital. Twelve months on, that hospital has only just moved out of tents into an interim, temporary building. This temporary centre only opened a few months ago. For nearly 12 months this community, of 5,000 people in the town and many hundreds more farm families in the surrounding area, had its community health centre, its hospital, operating out of tents. I am not talking about Bangladesh or Pakistan; this is northern Victoria, only three hours drive from Melbourne. That community was expected to look after its sick, its elderly and its children, using tents, and that is what they did. They need $18.3 million to rebuild their hospital, which was devastated by the floodwaters. I want to commend the chief executive of the hospital, Jacqui Phillips. She has been magnificent. In particular, she has been so patient. We have to do better when we have flood devastated infrastructure as vital as a hospital. That $18. 3 million is, of course, a lot in a state which inherited a lot of Labor debt, but you have to look at priorities sometimes. That town has to have its hospital replaced some time very soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Floods do not just inundate and destroy; they also cause road closures. Some individuals from Numurkah, Nathalia, Katamatite, Tungamah and other small places simply could not travel to work along the closed roads to centres like Shepparton, Cobram and Yarrawonga for weeks. Often, small businesses could not afford to pay individuals during their absence from work. In some cases individuals were required to use their holiday time. All of the community, well beyond those whose houses or farms were flooded, bore the brunt of this natural disaster. I commend those who were so stoic about this situation, who spent their time when they literally could not get up the road to go to work helping their neighbours—mopping out homes, pulling out rotting furniture, trying to make safe animals that were stranded and comforting the very elderly. I want to commend those communities, whose strength was extraordinary. They now have legends which I am sure will be passed on to other generations, about the amazing saves that occurred; the extraordinary metal flood barrier that was built in Nathalia, behind hundreds of thousands of sandbags; and the young children, the SES, the CFA, the Red Cross and other community groups who manned and patrolled that flood wall day after day, daring it to overtop. As I said, tragically the western region of the Murray electorate had its experience of the flood two years before; in the east of the electorate it was one year ago—all following that seven years of the worst drought on record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about how we can help in the longer term, because we have a problem with, for example, the flood loans that were offered. These natural disaster loans were made available from the federal government via the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria, who did their very best. But, if you have already had seven years of drought, obviously your farms and your small businesses have had their equity eroded, they have been going deeper into debt; so, when a government offer loans of up to $200,000 at some 3.2 per cent interest, they are very attractive, but unfortunately they are unavailable to many of the people who wish to borrow—they have had their equity eroded too far. Yet, with a break, these properties could be back being viable dairy farms, orchards or small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think we have to understand a bit more about the context in which loans are offered by the federal government, that we are going to be looking at a community of smallbusiness people and farmers whose equity is going to be very low but whose capacity to fight back, given a break, will be quite substantial—given the demand for food, the quality of their properties, the quality of their soils, the climate, what remains of their infrastructure, and their skills and expertise. In my area there was only $5.78 million lent to some 44 individuals in the shire of Moira, the city of Greater Shepparton and parts of Indigo. While 81 per cent of all the loans that were applied for were approved—54 were processed—and that may sound a good figure, so many of the people who came to my office and looked at the criteria just walked away sadly saying, 'We're not going to be eligible for these loans, given the erosion of our equity', and sadly those farms did need that support very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also very concerned about the exceptional circumstances drought support, which we have had for many years in Australia. It, of course, kept literally thousands of my farmers during the seven years of drought with food on the table. They were not able to make enough for their children to have even basic things like new school uniforms, or to go on school excursions—and they could certainly not take holidays. So the exceptional circumstances support, which gave them the equivalent of the Newstart allowance plus an interest rates subsidy, was an essential part of keeping numbers of our dairy farmers in business so our economies of scale could be maintained, which in turn of course kept our food factories in place, with all of the employment consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once we started to hear of a new regime of exceptional circumstances that Labor is proposing, you can imagine a lot of people sucked in their breath to see what might be proposed. I am not convinced that the new response to natural disasters that has been put on the table is adequate to deal with the situation where we are not looking at how to deal with prospective climate change but at when a natural disaster occurs suddenly. Whether it is fire or flood, and you have a devastating situation with a lot of loss, whether it is livestock, infrastructure or even lives, you do need an emergency response, you do need more than a low-interest loan which you cannot apply for because your equity has been eroded. So I am asking for this government to understand that there are extraordinary circumstances often in Australia, with low-interest loans not necessarily being the best way to provide support in the longer term. Rather, we need to be looking at how, in my part of the world in particular, we can better build our infrastructure—our rail and roads, which held up the water. The Goulburn-Murray Water Authority's infrastructure had not been built with the capacity to manage these floods. In fact, we know that the floods that occurred just two weeks ago again led to the inundation of the Shepparton East area, where Goulburn-Murray Water Authority channels seem to still be a problem in relation to of local flooding. We have to look at that infrastructure and how it can be better managed or built to withstand flooding, especially when we are told the new legislation related to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is to put another 420 gigalitres down the Murray and Goulburn rivers in my part of the world with the deliberate intention of further flooding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In finishing my remarks about natural disaster, I want to make the point that we are not responding sufficiently in my part of the world to fires. We have just heard from the member for Wannon about the devastating fires in his part of Victoria and we are very sympathetic for the loss that occurred in that Western District and in the beautiful areas around Stawell and Halls Gap and so on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my part of the world we have not had a history of bushfires because we had a lot of irrigation channels to intercept any fires such as grass fires or overland fires. We do not have that much mountainous country. But just after Christmas we had serious fires in the Violet Town area in the Shire of Strathbogie. The area does have quite inaccessible rough and steep and hilly country. That really drew to the attention of our local fire brigades, volunteers, Red Cross, our professional firefighters and to all of us the fact that you must have access to firefighting helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. They were the key to our being able to fight these fires in this very inaccessible country. The fact that those planes cannot fly after dark is a problem. I do not know how we surmount that. Fires that were being controlled during the daylight hours simply took control again after dark when the planes stopped dumping their loads of water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other problem with inaccessible country was that with a lot of these farm properties we were trying to send fire trucks in where the farm tracks and the farm creek crossings simply could not take the vehicles. We need to have better information for fighting fires in these areas. That means surveillance between fire seasons and information gathering so that we do not have loss of life or people or their equipment put at jeopardy because no-one quite knows the terrain or where the access tracks, fences, bridges and culverts are. I want to commend the Shire of Strathbogie, the local firefighters and volunteers who fed the firefighters, and the farm owners themselves who did everything they could to protect their own and their neighbours' properties. Fortunately there was no loss of life there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a serious problem in Victoria. We have the world's biggest red gum forest in the shape of Barmah Forest which is a high-risk area. It is so fire prone that the local country fire authority refuses to go in there should there be a fire. They argue that there have not been sufficient cold burns. There are no longer cattle grazing in the Barmah Forest so there is nothing to reduce the fire load other than cold burns. These are not being carried out. The tracks into the forest are now overgrown. Trees have fallen on them. If you should send in firefighters on the ground in trucks, their lives would be seriously in jeopardy. That is why local firefighting brigades say that, until the state does the job and cleans up the forest and makes sure that there are proper fire access tracks, they are not going to risk the lives of their members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more than that, we have a stupid situation where South Australia and New South Wales have a ban on any fires being lit in public areas, outdoors, state parks and state forests between the months of December and March through the fire summer season. Victoria, which has even more at risk country—especially along the Murray River—only has regulations which say that you cannot light a fire in the open on a total fire ban day. On any day in December, January or February which is not a fire ban day you can light a fire outside, with certain restrictions about the size of that fire. We had 10 unattended fires that our rangers had to put out at Ulupna Island on the Murray River this summer. Those rangers are very concerned that each one of those fires could have spread and burned Australia's biggest red gum forest, enormous numbers of wildlife—particularly a very vulnerable koala community. Yet we have this discrepancy between the regulations governing fire lit in the outdoors between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. I am calling again on the Victorian government to consider bringing its fire regulations into line with the two other states which border it so that we can have a better chance of controlling outdoor fires during this fire-prone period which occurs in Australia every summer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to make a statement about natural disasters in Australia. Clearly we depend on our volunteers in this country, and they are magnificent. We have seen sad loss of life through our fires in the past in Victoria; we have seen extraordinary loss of assets through flooding, in particular in my part of the northern plains of Victoria; we have also had drought, which has decimated families and left them so in debt that they struggle still to survive; and we have had fires—very happily, with this most recent fire, without loss of life, but I recall the Strathbogie fires of 1989-90, when there was loss of life. I thank the chamber.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  I too rise to join everyone else that has spoken on this motion on the national disasters over the past few months. I wish to offer my sincere thanks and admiration to the people of Australia who have been affected by these natural disasters, but also those that have not and have made a wonderful effort to help those in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to have listened to the member for Murray's contribution, and it reminds me of the words of Dorothea Mackellar's poem <span style="font-style:italic;">My Country</span>. It goes, in part:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I love a sunburnt country,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A land of sweeping plains,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Of ragged mountain ranges,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Of droughts and flooding rains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, given the events of the past two or three months, that is very relevant. It is certainly a country that has had many extremes: from the bushfires in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia to the drenching rains, the wild winds and the severe flooding unleashed on the eastern seaboard—not just once, but several times. Australians have definitely dealt with a range of natural challenges which have tested our resilience and resolve. For some people, the clean-up is a harsh reality, especially for those still rebuilding their lives following similar events in 2011. Once again, they have experienced the treacheries and trials of natural disasters and they have only recently been able to come up for air from the devastation that occurred previously. Many that we have spoken to have not yet even managed to complete renovations, repairs, replacements or relocations. They have yet again had to deal with the unpredictability of torrential summer rains. Following these recent events, particularly around Bundaberg and the Fraser Coast, people have still not been able to re-enter their homes or even to salvage what they can of their lifelong possessions. This in itself, I am assured, is most devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were fortunate once again in my electorate. Whilst there were widespread outages for our electricity et cetera, by and large we were spared the devastation of further up the coast and in the Logan, Albert and Coomera rivers. At last count, there were only some 15 houses that were inundated—some partially but some substantially—and the people in those places have lost almost all of their goods and possessions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But through all of these fires, storms and floods, it is always heartening to watch that spirit of mateship—an unwritten Aussie code of conduct—that emanates across the country; whether it is Victorians heading to Tasmania or Tasmanians flying to Queensland to help out one disaster after another and to repay the favour of lending a hand to a mate when he is in dire straits. After recent floods in my electorate of Forde, which were some three inches or so below the 1991 flood—which was the last major flood that we had—I visited the Logan River Tree Farm, where they had at least 1½ metres of floodwaters through their mature tree nursery. When I visited, Ailsa Thompson and her staff were working frantically hand washing the leaves and stems of hundreds of trees with the few hoses they had. They were desperately trying to save seven years of hard work, which included the recovery from the 2011 floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thanks go to the local council and the local fire station. After we contacted them and made them aware of the situation, they were able to make available a number of high-pressure water appliances to help make the job easier, particularly given that the trees were reasonably mature and on large concrete pads. Their main work was to clean the mud off those concrete pads to make access to the trees easier. My thanks also go to local councillor Jennie Breen for her effort in putting together a working bee, which was very well received by a number of people in our community, but there remains much work to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, some 14 properties were affected by the floods and, in many cases, houses were also left without power for up to five days. One major piece of infrastructure that, fortunately, on this occasion was not damaged beyond repair—although it was significantly damaged in 2011—was the John Muntz Causeway at Upper Coomera. Fortunately, we have been able to reopen that piece of road, but it is operating on only one lane, as it has been since 2011. Thankfully, the federal government, out of the natural disaster relief funding, is contributing along with the state government to the replacement of that causeway. The result will be significantly better than what is currently there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the 1974 floods at my home in Waterford. It was interesting to see the current floods and note how much bigger the 1974 floods were than those we had recently. Thankfully, this year's flood level stayed well below the '74 levels; otherwise there would have been far more devastation. I saw a house that, on this occasion, had a small amount of water go through it, but I remember the effort involved in cleaning that up in 1974, when it was under about three metres of water that covered the roof.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commend the local councils, both the Gold Coast City Council and the Logan City Council, on the work that they did in trying to notify residents in at-risk areas. Also, as the water receded, they returned to each of these homes to assess the flood impact and offer clean-up assistance to affected homes. As with any of these things, some people were missed along the way, but this has been a great experience for the council to try to improve its processes. My thanks go to the SES, the local state MPs, the councillors and community groups, who were all out in force assisting affected people. I would also like to thank everybody on the Gold Coast weather website, which continued to put up information for people on what was happening around the neighbourhood, and also the people who started the Logan region weather and information page on Facebook. These same people also started a drop-in centre at Park Ridge for people who needed assistance. When people in the community are working together to help provide information to everyone else in the community and let them know what is happening locally, it makes dealing with these events so much easier for everybody involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The damage that has occurred during these natural disasters around the country has been phenomenal. Our thoughts go out to those people who have lost income, livelihoods and valuables, not only in my electorate but around the country. We thank the federal government for its support of those people in difficult times and also the various state governments, because they have their own disaster relief arrangements as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those in my electorate of Forde, whilst Logan and the Gold Coast were not declared natural disaster areas for individuals, we have written to the Attorney-General on behalf of people and businesses affected for consideration on an individual basis. We do thank the government for the fact that a number of those people have already been assisted. We must not to forget them just because we are a month or two down the track. These people will take a long time to recover from what they have been through. I encourage people to continue to get behind those who have been through these disasters and assist them in rebuilding their lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AN1" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOHN COBB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the natural disasters. As I was sitting here a while ago listening to my colleague speak, it struck me that it does not really matter what religion or god you believe in—if you are a farmer, you very definitely believe in Mother Nature. Just lately she has been a very, very tough lady. She can be absolutely wonderful, but just listening I realised that in the last month or so we have had fire, flood and drought all at the same time in our country. As the member for O'Connor will no doubt tell us shortly, we did have and still have very serious drought in WA. In western New South Wales, if you have not had the recent rain, you are still going into it. We have the repetition of floods in central and south-eastern Queensland and south-western Queensland. At the same time we have had fires in northern New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, as we just heard the member for Murray talking about. They are all horrible and they all have an incredible effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strangely enough, the greatest stock losses, and probably the greatest loss of human life, is not normally due to fire, except where you get an incredibly quick one—which you would expect—or to drought, although it can be if it goes on long enough; normally it is flooding that seems to take the most in human life and in stock, I guess because we do not take it as seriously as fire. But, by heaven, in recent years it has caused an enormous loss of life in Queensland and enormous losses in terms of our animals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Friday and Saturday just after the worst of the flooding had subsided in Bundaberg and up in that area, in North Burnett, Banana and Gladstone, I was up there with my leader, Warren Truss, Paul Neville and Kenny O'Dowd, the member for Flynn. In Bundaberg it was quite something. It was a record flood; it was beyond anything ever seen. Two years before it had gone up to just under eight metres. This time it went over nine. It was just an amazing thing. That last metre of water is one heck of a lot of water. When you think how flat it is there, you are talking an unbelievable amount of water. There were something like 2,500 homes inundated, and, if it had not been for the helicopters, undoubtedly people would have been in a lot more trouble than they were. The same thing occurred two or three years before up in central Queensland, and of course a couple of years before, almost to the day, down in the Lockyer Valley. You do not expect Mother Nature to be quite so severe so at times close together in pretty much the same places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw things with dairy through North Burnett and areas up there, where people, for three, four and five days, were unable to milk their cows. For anyone who understands dairies at all—and obviously a lot do not—they are not going to milk again after going out for that time. They go dry and get incredible complications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One family that we saw there were just at the end of their tether. It was a father and son, and they had an electrician there. He could hook the power up, but they could not make anything work because most of the motors were still under water. They had to hand milk something like 400 cows just to try to relieve them, and that does not work that well—not with today's number of people to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a family I really worried about, but they were not the only ones. There were others that had gone for days without milking—others had gone five. One bloke had pigs for 30 or 40 kilometres around. He would get a phone call to say, 'There's a couple of pigs wandering around here—are they yours?' At least they were alive; a lot were not. There were permanent plantings in orchards where there was just nothing there. I am talking about serious citrus trees, and it looked like a desert. It was pretty horrendous stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that everyone had to be commended for hooking into it; governments—local, state and federal. I think that, by and large, people did what they could and did the right thing. It got to the point where, particularly up there around north Burnett and further up, they could not even ring. It was mobile country—the standing lines were down. But after a couple of days the mobile towers do not work because their batteries go flat. Embarrassing as it might have been for Telstra, that was the case for quite some time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes there is only so much that people can take. At least Emerald, Theodore and those that have been belted twice in a couple of years were spared this time, but Bundaberg and the horticulture there—not to mention the domestic side within the town—certainly had Mother Nature give them some hurry-up over those two or three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the fisheries were totally wiped out two years before; cattle had ended up on North Keppel Island that time, and it is away out on the Great Barrier Reef. Certainly, once again beef cattle, as well as dairy cattle, have been scattered across the countryside. There were people who were missing a thousand cattle. At times like this you wonder why we farmers do it. We deal with flood, fire and drought and, as I said, this particular time it was all happening in our country at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my part of the world—I grew up in an area in the Cobar shire—through the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties and into the nineties we had serious fires every 10 years. My electorate, Calare, was pretty lucky with the fires. It did have some small ones, but nothing like in the north of the state and certainly nothing like in Victoria and Tasmania—thank heaven! We had flood last year—Forbes was cut into three—but, once again, not like the sorts of floods that South-East and west Queensland had over the last few years. One would think that that part of the world at least is going to be spared a repetition of it in the near future; these things do seem to even out. But I think we have to take our hats off to the people who have marched through it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, I think that by and large the right thing has been done by the various levels of government. Certainly, when called upon the armed forces did their job as professionally and competently as they always do when asked to do it. Wherever it happens—not just agriculturally, but in all ways—I think we have to admire the people who shrug and get on with it and who say, 'Next time we'll be luckier.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  Natural disasters like those in the Prime Minister's speech and those mentioned today by members in this place have also been affecting Western Australians, particularly in my electorate of O'Connor, where we lost a volunteer firefighter in the Two Peoples Bay bushfire west of Albany last October. Wendy Bearfoot suffered horrific burns to more than 60 per cent of her body when her truck was engulfed by flames caused by a freak wind change and, sadly, she passed away as a result of injuries. 25-year-old Charlene Hordyk was also badly injured with burns to 20 per cent of her body along with five other fellow firefighters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to acknowledge the bravery of these Australians who are risking their lives to help protect other people's lives and property. I would also like to offer my sincere condolences to Mrs Bearfoot's family including her husband of 30 years and her three children. To Charlene and the other injured firefighters I wish them a very speedy recovery and thank them for the outstanding contribution they have made to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Two Peoples Bay fire was only one of several bushfires around my electorate, with other major fires in Esperance on the South Coast, Bremer Bay on the mid-South Coast and Northcliffe last month. In all of the stories that members have contributed to this discussion there is a common theme and that is the remarkable work of emergency services personnel and the thousands of volunteers who support them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bushfires are not the only disasters to hit the O'Connor electorate, although they are the dramatic events that catch our attention most vividly and that demand our vigilance. Freak weather events are becoming more common across this vast electorate such as the storm that devastated the small community of Dudinin in the central wheat belt. While the east coast of Australia has been hit by similarly dramatic flood and fire, Western Australians and particularly Western Australian farmers have been suffering the much slower and less striking effects of drought and other unpredictable weather patterns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been contacted by many of these farmers who are currently in dire straits. They have said that this season has been particularly difficult. In some parts of the state it is the culmination of five dry years in a row. Others are experiencing unseasonal rainfall patterns and freak storm events. WA farmers are under some of the most difficult agricultural conditions in the world, which appear to be getting more difficult with changing weather and increasing incidences of natural disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with all disasters there is one critical factor that enables us as individuals and as communities to prepare in advance, to manage the event while we experience it and to react to a worst-case scenario when it happens. That critical factor is information. Information is the key to working together in difficult situations. Information is the tool that allows us to assess past disasters and to plan for future disasters. The availability of information is a service we rely upon in the modern world to keep in touch with our loved ones, to make sure that they are all right and to check whether they need our help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Information is critical for emergency services responding to big disaster events. It is also critical for farmers and communities struggling to cope with a series of lesser, progressive events that combine to create a disaster for their lives and livelihoods. Information is important for local governments, for health services including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, for the main roads, for industry, for tourists and travellers, and for people in their homes when these disasters strike. However information is the one thing that the firefighters at Two Peoples Bay were working without.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 12 October 2012 Wendy Bearfoot and her colleagues were working in an area with limited radio network coverage and no mobile phone reception. There was little or no means of conveying critical information about changing conditions. There was little or no means of calling for help. In a dangerous situation where rapidly changing weather can make the difference between life and death, how can this be an acceptable set of circumstances for our emergency services to operating under? Yet this is the exact situation in many regional areas. In the Great Southern region around Albany, the local Chief Bushfire Control Officer, Mr Ross Fenwick, has been working with state member of the Legislative Council Mr Colin Holt to identify nine bushfire brigade sheds that receive no mobile phone coverage whatsoever and a further seven that can only access a signal via connection to an external antenna. These are the volunteer bushfire brigades that thousands of people are relying upon to protect them, their property and their livestock against bushfire events that are a serious threat, not just an outside possibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it is not just the bushfire scenario we need to consider when we talk about the lack of critical information. The Bureau of Meteorology has recently decommissioned the Eucla weather radar on the Western Australian and South Australian border. I understand that the radio was old and that it was going to be costly to replace it, so it has been switched off. This is a service that provides critical weather information to emergency services, to the flying doctors, to the main roads, to the pastoralists and to the local and travelling community. It is a service that is seriously lacking in other parts of O'Connor as well, denying people the information they need to protect themselves and to defend themselves against weather events that can devastate their lives immediately in freak events or slowly over seasons and years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate offices have been approached time and time again by farmers crying out for government support. They tell me they need more information—critical weather information. They need to know when and where rain is falling so they can farm productively because, while the effects are not so obvious and not so immediately dramatic, drought is a natural disaster like flood and like fire. It has the power to take away people's lives and livelihoods. These farmers need to know what has happened in previous years so they can prepare for what seasons might look like in the years to come. They need weather radar so they can prepare for and respond to changing conditions so that those conditions do not become a disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that at least two weather radars are necessary, one in the wheat belt and one in the south-west. This is in addition to the existing weather services, which need to be protected and replaced when necessary. But what I am hearing is that the weather radar is being decommissioned, and it is not only Eucla that is getting the chop. I understand that the Bureau of Meteorology has undertaken a review recommending the enclosing of aerodrome forecasting equipment at 78 regional aerodromes around the country. This equipment, like the Eucla radar, is old and needs upgrading. I understand that the costs of upgrading these services is somewhere near $7 million. What I want to ask is: what is the cost of not upgrading this equipment? What is the cost of switching off these services and taking away this source of vital weather information for remote and regional areas? What is the cost to these communities that can no longer rely on the Royal Flying Doctor Service, because the flying doctor does not have the information required to get in and out of a particular aerodrome safely? What is the cost to the communities when the viability of their aerodrome services is questioned by operators that cannot afford the extra costs of contingency fuel supplies to make it into the next aerodrome in case the weather is found to be inclement upon arrival? And what is the cost of further isolation from emergency services, from essential services and from help? The cost is similar to that experienced by communities whose fire brigades cannot communicate effectively. It is a drastic and dangerous cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore members of this House to think more broadly about natural disasters, not just about how we help people to clean up and support them with crisis response initiatives and not just about how to assist communities struck by dramatic events. These communities are very worthy, and they must receive our help. But I implore the government and future governments to help and support the people on the ground who are preparing for, managing against and battling with the effects of all sorts of natural disasters, big and small, on a daily basis. In Western Australia this means that people in regional areas in O'Connor and across rural Western Australia must be provided with more information—equip them with the tools they require, arm them with the information they rely upon, provide them with critical information services and information communication services so that when things do go wrong they have the very best chances to survive and to carry on battling in the years to come. These people need mobile phone towers. They need weather radar and weather stations. They need to know that they will have the information they need when they need it. And they need to know now that the government takes the natural disasters they are experiencing seriously and will help them to protect themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 in Australia, one of the most advanced, prosperous and privileged nations in the world, how can we justify denying a significant proportion of our population this kind of information? It is information that is so much more critical to those people living in remote and isolated communities amongst harsh and dangerous environments and far from major service provision centres. This information is taken for granted by the rest of the population and by populations across other developed nations. It is time that we brought our regional Australians up to date and provided them with these basic services. Australians in the regions need information and services for communication for their survival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a huge anomaly in talking about supporting people in the face of weather driven natural disasters when we are taking away weather monitoring data services. There is a huge contradiction in providing services for emergency situations if those services cannot communicate effectively when the disaster strikes. The bottom line is always going to be very important, but in this instance the bottom line must not cost lives.</span>

                  <a href="1K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BILLSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  The passing of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, AC, DBE, was a particularly sad and poignant day for the Dunkley community. Dame Elisabeth was a local resident and had inculcated herself into so much of the life of the local community. We knew her as a neighbour, as a friend, as a patron to many organisations and as an inspiration to many local people. There was a wonderful tribute paid to her not just as a one-way gesture but as a statement of mutual support in the establishment of the Elisabeth Murdoch Secondary College, which is located in Langwarrin not far from her home. They have benefitted from the guidance and wisdom of Dame Elisabeth and from the example that she set for and the encouragement that she gave to the students. She had a genuine commitment to the success and vitality of that school community. In return, the school community has honoured her for many years and they were particularly saddened by her passing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That day, 6 December 2012, was a day when we lost a great national identity, a remarkable woman who fostered optimism and new possibilities. She was also an incredibly generous spirit and highly respected among the local community. Even in recent weeks, Cruden Farm, that delightful home that Dame Elisabeth raised a remarkable family in for generations, has still hosted community organisations, celebrations, events and fundraising for community groups who might not otherwise be able to access an opportunity to use such a splendid and special place. It is in reach of so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also remark on the very particular sadness that her dedicated staff felt upon Dame Elisabeth's passing. I have known a number of them over many years. They are widely recognised, particularly the gardening team under the leadership of her gardener, a fellow green thumb and gardening traveller who has been so much a part of Dame Elisabeth's expression of commitment to Cruden Farm and the majesty of that property. I cannot imagine the loss that they must have felt. I have spoken with a number, including at the funeral. They have a very raw and real sense of grief at the passing of someone who so much a part of their lives as they were a part of Dame Elisabeth's life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her life was one lived with purpose and passion. She was not wishy-washy on many views. She had strongly held views, but arrived at those views after careful consideration. She was devoted to her family and very dedicated to the many medical, artistic and community endeavours that benefited from her drive and generosity. Much will be written about Dame Elisabeth's invaluable contribution to and support for national significant cultural, scientific and medical organisations. But she had a profound impact on the course of the lives of many who her work touched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the Elisabeth Murdoch Secondary College, perhaps you and others might be aware of the world-class McClelland Gallery, a sculpture facility of high quality dedicated to sculpture on a property that spans many hectares, including bushland areas of high environmental significance punctuated by remarkable works of sculpture. Dame Elisabeth was a benefactor of and an inspiration for that gallery for many years. It will also be a lasting tribute to her passion, her support, her personal encouragement and her engagement with local artists and community organisations—but one example of the very meaningful and lasting legacy she leaves our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned Cruden Farm. Dame Elisabeth was a very willing and keenly engaged host, opening her family home and the remarkable gardens to so many. It brought great joy and delight to countless worthwhile causes. Everyone loved exploring that garden. Who would have thought that in the outer suburban areas around Frankston would be—as I used to say to Dame Elisabeth—the Langwarrin botanical gardens? It was actually her family property. She planned and nurtured that garden over decades, over generations, with such thoughtfulness. She was extraordinarily proud of that property. As I said, her partners in the remarkable endeavour, the gardening team, were so devoted and so committed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That garden caused me to learn a bit more at Dame Elisabeth's urging. I was fortunate to be, from time to time, invited as a guest. We would sit and talk over lunch about some of the challenges, the pressing issues, of the world, and occasionally we would talk about the goings-on within her family. They were lovely luncheons. On one occasion she asked whether I could be of assistance to her. I was always keen to support her work as she in turn supported the work of so many in our community. She was passing off one of her patron roles because as her life progressed her remarkable energy was maintained, but the spread of hours over which it was applied had to be curtailed, at the advice of those who cared for her. I am sure my friend and colleague might be aware of some of the gardening varieties that are collected. She asked me whether I would be happy to be a patron of one of the floral societies down our way.</span>

                  </a>  No, you are very kind not to point those out! It was a wonderful discussion. Dame Elisabeth said, 'Bruce, what do you know about orchids?' I said, 'Dame Elisabeth, what I know about orchids you could write in crayon on the back of a stamp.' She said, 'Perfect; you will enjoy much in learning about orchids.' I said, 'I do have the odd orchid or two.' She said, 'I would be really grateful if you would relieve me of the responsibility of being patron of the Mornington Peninsula Orchid Society.' I said, 'Obviously the criteria has been relaxed significantly, to go from your good self to me, but if I can help out I would be happy to.' I learnt so much about orchids. I did my research. I was happy to present prizes at the annual show.</span>

                  </a>  Not colour but hues, the various varieties within the genus and what was discovered in any given year. I remember vividly her encouragement to be the patron and to present the prizes at the annual show. I brought along my own creation one year—that was my then newly-born daughter, who gained a sash as best of breed at the show. She was not quite an orchid variety but she carried the gene pool of my sweetheart, Kate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were some of the wonderful memories that I have of a remarkable woman. Her extended family I have, through public service, been pleased to count as acquaintances over many years. Our thoughts will continue to be with Dame Elisabeth and with her extended and extensive family. When I was shown some of the family photographs of the Christmas gathering I was not sure it was not the crowd at the Dolphins footy finals, but, no, it was the children and the cousins. It was quite a turnout but a time of great joy for Dame Elisabeth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She has an extraordinary network of beneficiaries from a life of selfless service and generous community  engagement. The support of her family, her personal staff and a network of confidants has enabled Dame Elisabeth to achieve so much and to touch the lives of so many. I miss her. I miss her insights and that sparkle in her eye that I will always remember. Her passing will leave a massive hole in our local community, as a friend and as a neighbour, as a contributor and as a remarkable individual who lived as an enduring example of a long and purposeful life splendidly lived. The community that I represent in the greater Frankston-Dunkley area will forever remember Dame Elisabeth for her caring nature, her warmth, her kindness, her generosity, her integrity. We were thrilled that she was a neighbour and a friend—an inspiration. We have been blessed that she has been part of our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="VU5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GRIFFIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I join the member for Dunkley in expressing sadness at the passing of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, but also recognition of a life well lived, a life lived to the full and a life that achieved so much not only for the local community but also for the community of Victoria and for the people of Australia. Her family can be rightly proud. Although from humble beginnings, she really made the most of the opportunities that she had. Like the member for Dunkley, I share the distinction of having been a local member for the Langwarrin area, albeit for a shorter time than him—just one term. I have to admit that in that time I did not meet Dame Elisabeth. I am also confident that she never voted for me, so I stand here to acknowledge someone of views politically different to mine but whose absolute commitment to her community was extremely well known.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also grew up as a Frankston boy and lived in Karingal, not far down the road from Langwarrin and Cruden Farm. Even as a young man, I knew it was a famous place. The member for Dunkley mentioned the situation about the McClelland Gallery, which was just up the road from where I lived at that time, and it is also a great reminder of and a tribute to Dame Elisabeth and her commitment to the local area. As a local member, I often drove at that time and since past Cruden Farm and realised I was passing a place of special significance not only to the local community but also to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you try to encapsulate a life such as this, it is basically all words and is hard to do it justice. Sometimes, to try to do that you fall flat—I certainly know that I will—but I would like to pick a few things that have been said by others, and some things that were said by Dame Elisabeth herself, that say so much about the nature of the lady—and she was a lady—and the nature of the mark that she left on the community of which she was part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One story that I found fascinating was that in the time after 1975 there was an active discussion at cabinet level about Dame Elisabeth possibly becoming Australia's Governor-General. I quote from an article:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Years later, when told of these cabinet discussions, Dame Elisabeth reacted indignantly. "I am astounded. How could anyone even suggest I should be governor-general of Australia?" she said, completely rejecting the widely held view that she would have been a splendid choice at such a crucial time in Australia's history. Dame Elisabeth's final say on the matter was: "I'm ashamed when they invite me to be included in <span style="font-style:italic;">Who's Who </span>and ask me to write down my academic degrees and qualifications and I can write down nothing except home duties. Never in a million years would I have said yes to any suggestion that I become governor-general."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here today and say I wish she had said yes, although I know that at the time the Governor-General who was appointed served in that role with great distinction, as have, frankly, those who have followed on since then. But it says much about the lady herself that her response was that she was not worthy. Yet she filled her life with so many worthy acts and so many worthy ideals. For example, and I quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For 33 years she was a member of the committee of the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne—and president for the last 12 years before her retirement. The driving force behind the site and construction of the great new hospital in beautiful Royal Park, Dame Elisabeth even took on Victoria's legendary premier Henry Bolte—and won—when he was urging a less favourable site. Then there were her years as trustee of Victoria's National Gallery, her support for the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and her hidden life as one of Australia's most generous philanthropists, helping people and organisations with millions of dollars distributed through the Elisabeth Murdoch Trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young artists and musicians were given the chance to study overseas because of her generosity, which also spread to support for talented prison artists serving long sentences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth was also a founder of Melbourne's Murdoch Children's Research Institute; the first woman appointed to the Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria, as I mentioned; and President of the Royal Children's Hospital from 1954 to 1965. The CEO of the Royal Children's Hospital, Christine Kilpatrick, said Dame Elisabeth was the driving force behind the establishment of the Royal Children's Hospital at the Royal Park site in the sixties and was a passionate supporter of the hospital's work. Murdoch Children's Research Institute Chairman, Leigh Clifford AO, said Dame Elisabeth's vision and commitment had saved thousands of children's lives and improved the health of many who are living with rare and common childhood conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Dunkley mentioned the McClelland Gallery. Robert Lindsay, Director of the McClelland Gallery Sculpture Park in Langwarrin, said Dame Elisabeth was committed to the gallery for more than four decades. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She had the vision, energy and passion for this gallery as well as helped with financial support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She was an incredible person, who led by example. If she decided something was important, she would go ahead and do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth was patron of more than 100 charities and continuously supported local causes and individuals on the peninsula. Tim Harper, Principal of Elisabeth Murdoch College in Langwarrin, paid tribute to Dame Elisabeth and her incredible generosity of spirit:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I consider myself very fortunate to have had multiple opportunities to meet with Dame Elisabeth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She was always friendly and open and a tremendous person. Words can't describe how generous and community minded she was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Harper said he always felt inspired when walking away from a conversation with her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we hear, from those comments, those involvements, those commitments and those ideals, that this was a lady who had much to be proud of, who was at the same time was self-effacing and modest but also a person of strongly held views. She was someone who could be very proud of what she achieved in her time on this earth. It was a long time, but she had a good time, and the things that she did will live on long after her passing. Her family should be proud, as are all Australians, of someone who lived her life in a way that was of great credit to herself and her family and also those around her.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I join with my colleagues on both sides of this House in paying tribute to Dame Elisabeth Murdoch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth lived a long and fruitful life. Her passing on 5 December 2012, aged 103, was marked by a chorus of admiration that came from all corners of society, community organisations that were beneficiaries of her philanthropy, business and political leaders who were in awe of her courage and constancy and of course her 77 living, direct descendants, including five great-great-grandchildren, that were touched by her love and affection. All came to know and respect this remarkable woman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite being born to a different time, when Australia was a different place, Dame Elisabeth's values and purpose never lost their relevance and appeal. She would say, 'It is personal relationships that bring happiness, not money,' and, 'Always think of other people before yourself.' And help others she did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting more than 100 charities, in particular the Royal Children's Hospital and the children's research institute that bears her family name, Dame Elisabeth gave much more than financial support to her chosen causes. She gave her time and her ideas, often helping to drive new projects and build broader support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was the first woman on the Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria, a founding member of the Deafness Foundation of Victoria, a founding member of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop, on the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria—and the list goes on. So many organisations were beneficiaries of her involvement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Acknowledging Dame Elisabeth's significant contribution to society, the Queen made Elisabeth a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1963. Dame Elisabeth was later awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia, in 1989, and in 2005 she was named Victorian of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is often the case that great people who live great lives do not always have an easy run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth is no exception. After what was described as a fairy-tale romance, the marriage of Dame Elisabeth and Sir Keith came to an end after 24 years, following the untimely death of Sir Keith in 1952. Dame Elisabeth also experienced the tragic loss of her daughter Helen Handbury due to cancer in 2004.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Dame Elisabeth nevertheless continued on, hardly resting from her charitable efforts, and travelling down to Melbourne often, from the family property at Cruden Farm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember countless charity functions where Dame Elisabeth would be welcomed as a special guest, only to find later during the auction that you could bid for an afternoon spent with friends having tea at Cruden Farm. I do not know how many times Dame Elisabeth hosted guests at Cruden Farm following a charitable auction, but I am sure there would be just too many to count.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a fascinating exchange in 2008, Andrew Denton interviewed Dame Elisabeth and asked her, if Keith was to return now, what he would think of her and what she has achieved in her life. 'Oh,' she said, 'I think he'd be very proud. I haven't wasted a minute. I've made use of all that time—and, I think, good use of it. That's what I hope one would think.' And so she has. A remarkable life. A remarkable lady.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My condolences go to all of Dame Elisabeth's family—in particular her children Rupert, Anne and Janet, and Janet's husband John Calvert-Jones. To Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch, whom I have come know, and the Calvert-Joneses, who are good friends, I join with you at this sad time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians can be proud that Dame Elisabeth was one of their own. There are few people in the world who can match her record of philanthropy and good deeds over such an extended period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">May she rest in peace.</span>

                  <a href="LKU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  I rise today to speak about a great Australian: Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. There are no words that can adequately portray the contribution Dame Elisabeth made to the community and Australia as a whole. She was an inspiration for thousands of people around this nation, and she was an inspiration to me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the very great pleasure of meeting Dame Elisabeth on a number of occasions. I enjoyed sitting next to her at dinner, which guaranteed a lively conversation. Dame Elisabeth was known not only for her sharp wit and curious mind, but for her ability to converse with people from all walks of life. On her conversational skills, she was once famously asked, 'What is the art to holding a conversation over a dinner table, to engage in someone?' She responded, 'Ask the man what he does. That's my opening. I am never stuck for a question. If you ask your next-door neighbour what he does it flows out. You can't stop him.' It is good advice, and having tested it I can say that it is accurate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred and four years ago, Dame Elisabeth was born in Melbourne and educated at St Catherine's School, in my electorate of Higgins, followed by Clyde School in Woodend. Dame Elisabeth had deep roots within the Melbourne community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At an early age Dame Elisabeth displayed a strong commitment to charity, for which she is so well-known. She volunteered for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and, as a school girl, knitted a record number of baby garments for the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne. This last activity earned her a tour of the hospital, which confirmed to her that her life would be one of service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This passion for helping others drove her life's work. But it was not her only passion. At the age of 19 she was courted by, and then married, one of Australia's leading publishers, Sir Keith Murdoch. They had four children: Rupert, Janet, Anne and Helen. In 1952 Dame Elisabeth assumed the role of matriarch, when her husband passed away from cancer at the age of 67.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth served as President of the Royal Children's Hospital Management Committee from 1954 to 1965 where she was the driving force behind fundraising events and donations. She was recognised for her work in 1963 when she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. This association with the Royal Children's Hospital is one, of course, that is a close connection and one that so many Australians and particularly Victorians really, really admire her for and have received much benefit from. I have a very good friend who is currently receiving excellent care with her newborn baby at the Royal Children's Hospital. It is a very stressful time and I know that without the great care and skill of the people at the Royal Children's Hospital it would be a very, very traumatic time for her. So we admire Dame Elisabeth for the great work that she did there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1968 Dame Elisabeth became the first woman on the Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria. She held the position for eight years. In the same year she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Melbourne in acknowledgement of her contributions to research, the arts and philanthropy. Trinity College installed her as a Fellow in November 2000. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1976 she co-founded the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and served as its chairman from 1986 to 1988. In 1984 she helped found the Murdoch Institute known today as the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, another very well-known and well-regarded institute. She was an honorary Fellow of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architecture and she funded the Elisabeth Murdoch Chair of Landscape Architecture and the Australian Garden History Society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an interview later in her life, she was asked why she dedicated her life's work to helping others. Her response was 'as a sort of thanksgiving'. Humble to the very end, Dame Elisabeth understood and respected the life that she was handed and, in turn, gave back to those less fortunate. Graceful and elegant, Dame Elisabeth was someone we could all look up to as an example of the human spirit at its most gracious and compassionate. Dame Elisabeth leaves a wonderful legacy. While she may have 77 direct descendants, her life has enriched millions more, and we thank her for that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I rise today to place on record my condolences to the Murdoch family on the passing of their wonderful matriarch, Dame Elisabeth Joy Murdoch AC DBE. Born five years before the start of World War I, Dame Elisabeth grew up in Toorak, the youngest of three daughters of Rupert and Marie Greene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At 18 years of age, Dame Elisabeth met the influential journalist and media proprietor Keith Murdoch at a Red Cross dance in Melbourne. Keith had actually arranged their introduction upon glimpsing her photograph in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Table Talk</span> magazine. Keith was 42 and their age difference set society tongues wagging. But they were married in a matter of months. They went on to have four children. Even though she was widowed only 23 years later, Dame Elisabeth always identified her loving marriage as the foundation of her long life. 'Happiness gives great strength,' she said. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A simple and practical woman, Dame Elisabeth believed that we lived in a materialistic age. Dame Elisabeth spoke of her family fortune and of philanthropy with the ABC's Andrew Denton. He asked her:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Is philanthropy about more than simply giving money?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She replied:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Oh you must be involved. I think if you've got money it's perfectly easy to give it away and nothing to be particularly proud of but it's being involved and knowing what you're helping. And you know, really being committed to whatever things you're helping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from raising her children, Dame Elisabeth devoted her life to philanthropy, supporting more than 100 different charities. She was devoted to the arts, to gardens and the landscape, to education and medicine, to the disabled and to the underprivileged. Her name is perpetuated at places like the Melbourne Recital Centre, the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and the former Langwarrin Secondary College. For her service as life governor of the Royal Women's Hospital, Dame Elisabeth was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division, CBE, in the 1961 Queen's Birthday Honours List.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth was keen to share her fortune. My sister Kate, who knew Dame Elisabeth, told me how she was very proud to give her support to less popular causes like children in care and those battling mental illness and substance abuse. Dame Elisabeth was also involved in an organisation to rehabilitate prisoners back into society. When asked in the interview with the ABC's Andrew Denton why she chose to support an organisation for prisoners, Dame Elisabeth said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… you can help them to rehabilitate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I find that the people who run them are so good. They're so selfless and so good giving their voluntary time. The world is full of good people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth passed away at her home in Langwarrin in December 2012. She was 103 years old. On behalf of the people of the Ryan electorate, I pass on my condolences to Dame Elisabeth's family.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I had the enormous pleasure of knowing Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. She lived just outside my own electorate. Very early on in my time in parliament, my then fiancee, Paula, and I were invited to Cruden Farm to meet with Dame Elisabeth—I think she was sort of kicking the tyres of the newest member in the area. We had a long discussion about life and about community, family and responsibility, and then she decided to take Paula and me on a drive through Cruden Farm gardens. She had been given a little four-wheel drive beach buggy by her family. She took off on this beach buggy, at what I think was then about age 93, and roared around her gardens at speeds which were probably illegal and certainly undesirable, and she was roaring with laughter the entire way. For me, it was an experience in speed at the fastest of levels, but for us there was a sense of a grandmotherly, by then great-grandmotherly, figure who loved life, had a great appreciation for community and family—we had spent the vast bulk of our time talking about the local community and its priorities—and was not afraid to live every day as if it mattered and to simply express the joy of her life. I think that was a fantastic thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a later occasion—by then I had met Dame Elisabeth and spent quite a bit of time with her on different fronts—I arrived at a charity dinner for the Royal Children's Hospital, to discover that I was seated next to Dame Elisabeth for the evening. There were about 600 people there and I sat down and said, 'Hello, Dame Elisabeth.' She said, 'Hello,' and I said, 'I think I'm your date for the evening.' She looked at me and said, 'Could do worse; could do better.' She was a very relaxed soul throughout all her later years. Of course, I did not know the earlier incarnation, but I know many people who did know the earlier incarnation of Dame Elisabeth and they said, 'Take the 93-, the 95- or the 99-year-old and imagine what she was like in her 40s, 50s and 60s'—this phenomenal ball of goodwill and energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Mornington Peninsula and in the Frankston area, she was simply the most adored citizen we had. There is no question about it. She was always seen as open and accessible. As the patron of more than 100 charities, many of which were local, she was a great supporter. I dealt recently with Beyond Disability. Beyond Disability is a group set up by Richard Stubbs and supported by people such as Tom McGann for those who have significant disabilities which cause almost complete immobility. Beyond Disability provides computers and computing software and training so that people—maybe with their teeth, maybe with voice command or in other ways—can manipulate and work on the internet and engage in computing activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth was of course a very strong supporter of this local peninsular charity, Beyond Disability. They were amazed at their access and the way in which they could engage with somebody who was engaged with the great global issues but who was also intensely aware of the community in her backyard. I know many community groups that have held events at Cruden Farm, were personally hosted by Dame Elisabeth and were amazed at the way in which she would make time and engage with them—in the sense not of polite tolerance but of deep personal interest in what they had to say and what their needs were. I recognise that Dame Elisabeth came from the most famous of families, but this was somebody who ignored all of that and was completely engaged in the local community. She did not care what somebody's station was in life; she just cared whether they were sincere, whether they had a need and whether she could assist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am delighted to acknowledge the life that was Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. I am delighted to have had a really wonderful set of encounters with her as a great resident of the top of the Mornington Peninsula. I thank her for her life and I pass on my best to her family—but I know that, whilst there is lots of sadness, they celebrate one of the great Australian stories.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I wish to join with the chamber in remembering the long and full life of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch and to convey not only my condolences but those of my family to her family—in particular my mother, because the mutual interests of both mum and Dame Elisabeth brought them into regular contact over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth has set a personal challenge for all of us in this chamber and in the broader community. She took her position—granted, it was a fortunate one, but she used her considerable skills and resources to make a difference by contributing to the life and wellbeing of her community. She did so with grace, humility and an enduring curiosity about the interesting people who made up that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would take too long to recite all of the contributions that Dame Elisabeth made to our community over the 104 years of her life. But I will mention a number, to demonstrate the diversity of her interests: to health, medical research and academia as Life Governor of the Royal Women's Hospital, patron of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria; and to adults and children with disabilities, as patron and founding member of the EW Tipping Foundation and as a founding member of the Deafness Foundation of Victoria. To international relations and business: she was patron of the Australian-American Association Victoria, which was founded by her late husband. To heritage, and flora and fauna: Cruden Farm at Langwarrin is one of Australia's finest examples of landscape gardening. She also devoted herself to less popular causes such as prisoners, children in care, those battling mental illness and substance abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come to her investment in arts organisations and artistic talent a little bit later, but Dame Elisabeth set the benchmark for how we can contribute to our community—whatever our financial and personal circumstances. Her passion and her commitment told us that volunteering and donating is not something you put off to next year or to better times; it is something that you do now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth also made it abundantly clear to all that contributing her money and time and energy to a cause brought a rich return to her personally, as well as to the community—she in fact showed philanthropy could be fun. Each of us here can follow her path and learn the rewards of service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is fitting that we honour her with this condolence motion. A few weeks back the Melbourne Recital Centre had more than 1,000 people come to the Elisabeth Murdoch Hall for its celebration of Dame Elisabeth's life. The deep interest and enjoyment of the arts, particularly music, led to her involvement in building some of our best arts companies. She supported the careers of many of our most talented performers and artists. She touched so many lives in the arts that it is no surprise the evening saw a full house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also fitting that we remember her in that last week, because it was then that we announced the name of Australia's new agency for philanthropy, social investment and business partnership in the cultural sector. That agency, Creative Partnerships Australia, is charged with building a culture of giving in Australia, something that Dame Elisabeth taught us so much about. In a way, through that organisation we will be building on her example and helping more and more Australians make a personal contribution to their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming from Melbourne, Dame Elisabeth was an integral part of Victoria, and Victorians all knew her work well. My mother in particular enjoyed the opportunity to interact with her when she was a member of the women's association, raising money for acquisitions at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was again another of those mutual interests that brought them together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth's longevity meant that she was able to see the impact of her philanthropy and her involvement. She could see what she was contributing to, and so many of the end results. More than most of us she knew that investing in the arts brings with it a significant dividend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Elisabeth received numerous honours throughout her life, including being made a Companion of the Order of Australia and a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. She had a long association with the Australian Ballet, Opera Australia, the Bell Shakespeare Theatre Company and the National Gallery of Victoria, of which she was the first female trustee. Dame Elisabeth was chair of the committee that established the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and a trustee and supporter of the establishment of the regional McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park, along with many other arts groups and individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She leaves a magnificent legacy, and it is incumbent upon all of us not only to respect her and pay condolences in her passing but, in respect for her, to continue to build upon so much of what she laid foundations for.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3A" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  We had the privilege of being part of the fifth anniversary of Closing the Gap. This is without doubt an incredible achievement, not just for the parliament but for our entire nation. Closing the Gap is an important bipartisan effort that recognises that the way forward will depend on people working together, irrespective or race or background, to improve education, health and quality of life for all Australians. It is an effort that, I am pleased to recognise, both sides of the political spectrum are striving towards. As the Prime Minister said in her speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Indigenous and non-Indigenous people of this country have decided to walk the path of reconciliation together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the Prime Minister acknowledged:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The mistakes made in one generation are being repaired in the next. The gap is being closed. So for all the challenges we will inevitably encounter between now and 2031, this is a moment to savour. Not just because we reached a target but because we showed what we can do together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, also rightly acknowledged the hard work that has gone into achieving the progress that has been made so far. Mr Abbott said in his Closing the Gap speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a new spirit in this land. There is a new spirit which reaches out to embrace the indigenous people of this country, so different from the spirit that was abroad when the Prime Minister and I were young. It is a tribute to so many people in this place and around our country that that is now the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to add my voice to the support of the many in support of the continued work to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I am pleased to see the involvement of parliamentary colleagues over the term of this parliament making contributions to those debates on many fronts. We see positive changes in the number of Indigenous Australians in employment, with 47 per cent of Indigenous Australians now in mainstream employment. That is significantly up from five years ago. It means that they participate in the economic opportunities that this country affords those who wish to take the pathway into different jobs and ultimately earn incomes that benefit their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also raise my concern that we do not lose focus at this critical point in our endeavours. I think if we take the headline messages out of both those speeches and walked into communities and the suburbs where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families live, we would see a gap that we would find hard to comprehend, given what we have heard in the parliament. Some of that gap is around missed opportunity in respect to education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look at the incarceration rates that are continuing to climb in every jurisdiction. That means you have young Indigenous Australians taking a pathway into corrective services and, in some instances, into recidivism where their incarceration rates become cyclic. They spend time out and they go back in. It is an opportunity that is lost in terms of the hope and aspirations that we desire for all young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at the Australian Public Service, I see Indigenous Australians employed within a number of agencies but there are very few in positions within the Senior Executive Service where they are contributing to not just the debate on the needs of Indigenous Australians but also the debate on the needs of the Australian public through the agency in which they work. For example, the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health focuses on the health of Indigenous Australians and yet in its history I have never seen any Indigenous person appointed to the most senior position within the organisation or to the branch manager positions within state and territory offices. I have seen them appointed to levels much lower than that, which is a pity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are truly closing the gap and changing the mindset we would have developed the capability for them to participate anywhere within the public sector. I hope that in 10 years we do not have identified positions within the public sector, that what we have is the same strategy that applied when we focused on equity for women. We did not create positions that were made for women as we do with Indigenous Affairs. Within the decade what I want to see is an Indigenous person holding a position at the deputy secretary or secretary level of a Commonwealth agency on merit and on the basis of the skills and capability that they bring. Although we have had gains, they are not significant enough to be uniform across the board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are closing the gap, we are making tremendous gains in leaps and bounds. But if we take the whole spectrum in terms of housing, community infrastructure and the number of people who are progressing in their quality of life, we see some disparities still. I would hope that, when we achieve the targets we have set under the national partnership agreements and through the COAG processes, we do not overlook all of those other factors that come into play. If we halt that then we will see a discrepancy between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. What I would also hope is that in the future Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs become the lesser pathway for progression within Australian society and a greater pathway of opportunity is created in a much broader context. I am always concerned, when we walk into Aboriginal communities, whether we really see the true story. That is why I have been a strong advocate of members of this parliament getting out into their electorates and identifying the gaps themselves. It is when you go and visit constituents, work with the organisations in the process of meetings, and understand the challenges and things that we have to change, that you will really see the gap close in a number of areas beyond just the five aspects we have targeted to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern is that some of the true nature of what is happening at our regional and remote Aboriginal communities is not accurately reflected in data. One of the things I love about data is that you can collect data, analyse it, bring it into a national construct and see where we have made change and differences, just through the trending of data. It is when we dig down and go back to the realities of families and communities that we see there are still gaps yet to be addressed. In a bell curve, 25 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have made significant advances, both within their career pathways and in the income that they bring home on a fortnightly basis. They are highly successful and they do the same normative things as any other Australian family whose members work full-time—although there is still a cultural obligation that you support and help family members. I suspect that that is why you do not see too many Indigenous Australians as millionaires: because we tend to have a cultural obligation of sharing the grief and pain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of my work on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I have seen with my own eyes the work that still needs to be done in our country. I have listened to community members and service providers on the ground, who work hard to achieve improved access to services that many of us take for granted. There are still people living in abject poverty with no help and no hope for a better future. There is a sense of futility for some individuals because they see no horizon of hope from where they currently sit within the context of the continuum of opportunities that prevail within our broader Australian community. Many Indigenous people are living under substandard living conditions relative to other Australians in all settings—rural, regional and remote. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only recently, I met with a group of Indigenous leaders in my own electorate and they talked about the substandard housing that some of them are living in and their frustrations in working with government agencies to try and remedy the problem. One of the elements that I really appreciated when the NPAs—national partnership agreements—were being framed was that the National Indigenous Reform Agreement had a set of principles as to how government agencies would work with Indigenous communities, organisations and people, whereby they were equal partners in shaping the way programs, services and initiatives would roll out to make a difference. Sadly, that has not occurred to the extent that I would have thought. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Life expectancy, employment rates, childhood mortality rates and literacy rates still show a marked difference between our Indigenous Australians and the rest of the Australian population in rural and remote regions. We still have a distance to travel to close the gap in Australia. We still need to fight for many families and young children who are facing an upward battle to have access to the same healthcare and education as children living in the metropolitan areas. One of the key challenges that still remain, as I said earlier, is the youth incarceration rate. I once participated in a review of imprisonment programs, and the element that came through in that was the normative thinking and expectation that imprisonment was a pathway in life—that it was just the normal process of living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have really got to focus on dealing with that issue. We also need to initiate long-term, lasting change. One excellent example of this is the training of Indigenous doctors. Doctors are making a tangible, positive difference in closing the gap. I saw the beginnings of the medical school in Newcastle, where Dr Sandra Eades graduated as one of the first Indigenous doctors. From that grew the pathways for many others. We now have in excess of 120 doctors. Kelvin Kong in New South Wales has completed the requirements to be a surgeon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have made strident gains in some key areas but we need that uniformly. We need to see individuals go into the financial sector and into areas that will generate opportunities for a rethinking of the contribution that can be made through the financial gains available to all of those who seek to invest and seek those opportunities. Young men and women are establishing their own enterprises and are being successful in a slow and steady way. Joe Proctor is a financial adviser and investor with Macquarie Bank. Terri Janke is the owner of Terri Janke and Company. Natalie Walker is the CEO of Australian Indigenous Minority Supplier Council. David William is from Gilimbaa. Quinton Tucker is at BYAC Contractors. All of them are employing other Indigenous Australians as part of their workforce but are engaging external people to skill them. Eventually they want to become strong economic entities in their own right to participate not only in the mining boom. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Isabelle Adams at Vision Network has had her own consultancy company for some time and has made a tremendous contribution to some of the reforms. Whilst we can acknowledge that we have closed the gap in some key areas, there is still much more work to be done. There needs to be a greater effort of consistency. The other element that has to be considered as a gap is the active participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being equal partners in the delivery of government services and programs. There is still a desire for the control to sit with state and Commonwealth government agencies. If the change occurs then we will see real ownership of many of the facets of the gaps that are still there and I think we will see improvements within the decade that parallel the achievements we have made thus far. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that we see within the next two terms of parliament further reporting on other key areas that demonstrate that we are on the path to success and that we are on the path where all Indigenous Australians work very closely and are part of the leadership of this nation in every field of endeavour—not just in Indigenous affairs but in the institutions, the financial structures of this country and the corporate sector. I congratulate both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their fine speeches that reflect the gains we have made thus far.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Hasluck in this important debate on closing the gap. He is the only Indigenous member of the House of Representatives and the Senate, which is an indication of one gap that we need to work to close. Were Indigenous Australians to be represented in this place in proportion to the number in the Australian population there would be at least five Indigenous members in parliament and many debates, this one included, would be richer for that. I hope we will see Nova Peris joining the next Senate, but we still will have further to go. It is an indicator of how many of these gaps take too long to close.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to represent an electorate which is the home of the Ngunawal people. Often when I am looking for stories of Indigenous Australia I turn to <span style="font-style:italic;">Stories of the Ngunnawal,</span> an excellent book which discusses some of the stories of the Ngunawal elders. One story by Dorothy Brown Dickson reminds us of how tough it was for some of the Ngunawal people. Ms Dickson grew up in an Aboriginal reserve in Yass. She refers to how tough life was for the young men. She says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">They couldn't have a drink in peace. They had nowhere else to have a drink and socialise as they weren't allowed in the pubs. People would come up there all the time arresting them, and taking them down to the lock-up. When the police needed slave labour to look after their yards and cut wood, there always seemed to be someone in jail to do it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Even the shop-keepers were prejudiced. You had to wait until the white people were served first in the shops. When Aborigines went to the picture theatre they had to sit down the front by themselves. And the welfare would come up there all the time, checking on people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She goes on to talk about her friend Betty Russell, who she used to walk to school with. She says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">One afternoon I went to Betty's place. Betty was quiet and her mother was sad. I asked What's the matter?' Betty said the welfare was sending her mother and brothers and sisters to Walgett. I was really sad. It really broke my heart but nothing could be done. I never saw Betty for years after that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that we report to parliament on progress on closing the gap. Progress on closing the gap is a multifaceted challenge. It involves issues of the heart, such as the inclusion of Indigenous peoples in the Constitution; symbolic acts of recognition, such as our existing practice of acknowledging traditional owners of the land in formal speeches; and perhaps in the future other practices, such as that adopted across the ditch, of dual naming of places. Today being Canberra Day it is appropriate to note that Canberra is the only Australian city that carries an Indigenous name rather than the name of a European settler or a respected European. We ought to have more cities in Australia carrying traditional Indigenous names.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to speak today about a number of pieces of work being done to close the gaps. They are not all directly connected with one another, but I do not think many of these efforts to close the gap are directly connected with one another either. One issue that I have been active on as a member representing a large number of public servants is ensuring that the Australian government meets its target of 2.7 per cent Indigenous employees in the Australian Public Service. This is of particular concern to me as a result of an issue raised by the CPSU here in the ACT recently—that the share of Indigenous public servants in the Australian Public Service has not been increasing but in fact declining, falling from 2.4 to 2.1 per cent. In an effort to work out what we can do to increase the share of Indigenous employees I wrote to all ministers asking what strategies they are employing to improve the share of Indigenous employees in their departments, and I thought I might share some of those strategies with the House today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Several departments have structured mentoring, leadership or buddy programs for Indigenous Australians, focusing on career development and ensuring retention. Other departments hold national conferences for their Indigenous employees as an opportunity to share ideas and experiences. Some departments have Indigenous apprentice, cadet and graduate programs as well as particular Indigenous strategy teams within their human resources divisions. In certain cases those human resources divisions have developed memoranda of understanding with Indigenous studies centres at universities as a way of partnering with those centres to get talented university graduates. There are departments that already exceed the 2.7 per cent target and are aiming higher. They have set aspirational targets for 2015. One minister has an Indigenous advisor working on his staff and has had that advisor for a number of years. Several departments participate in the Learn Earn Legend! Work Exposure with Government program, administered by DEEWR. It is a program that aims to give Indigenous Australians exposure to work in the offices of parliamentarians and in the Australian Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also work being done across the APS through its Diversity Council to make diversity issues visible, and there have been efforts to make sure that public servants are offered leave for cultural and ceremonial purposes which are appropriate to the needs of those employees. Those include up to two days leave with pay for participation in NAIDOC Week activities and cultural and ceremonial events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The targets are 2.7 per cent for departments that were below that threshold as at 2009, or a 20 per cent increase for departments that were above the threshold. I do hope that we will see the share of Indigenous employees in the public sector track upwards, perhaps even through use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recruitment agencies, better working with existing Indigenous staff to design and deliver cultural appreciation training and through identified Indigenous positions—meaning not that the person who is successful in getting the position need be Indigenous but that they must understand Indigenous issues and take responsibility for communicating effectively with Indigenous people. Such positions may well be an important step towards increasing the share of public servants who are from an Indigenous background.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A second issue to which I want to draw the attention of the House is work being done by Canberra public servant Daniel Billing, which has been publicised in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span> by their excellent education editor, Emma Macdonald. Mr Billing is working to provide home Kindles to Indigenous students. He noticed how his own seven-year-old took to the Kindle intuitively and enthusiastically, and so came up with a plan to fund Kindles for Indigenous students in an effort to boost their interest in reading. The ACT's only participant is Forrest Primary School sixth-grader Yulcailia Hoolihan-Mongta. At the time she received her Kindle, the 11-year-old had a reading age of nine and spent just 45 minutes a week reading. After 12 weeks with the Kindle she has increased her weekly reading to two hours and 20 minutes and gained about a year's worth of reading activity—a year's worth of reading activity just in that three-month period, according to her teacher, Gemma O'Brien.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Emma Macdonald for her work in publicising the Indigenous Reading Project and Daniel Billing for his activism, as well as the many generous philanthropists who have donated towards it. But one philanthropic body is notably absent, and that is Amazon.com. Amazon.com has Australian sales, I would estimate, of around $1 billion a year. Based on the available estimates, they hold about one-10th of the $13 billion online sales market. And yet Amazon.com pay no GST, they pay no company tax and they make no charitable donations to a single Australian charity—$1 billion in sales, and not a cent in charitable donations. I asked Amazon.com how they could defend this, but I got no comment. I think this is unacceptable; I think Amazon ought to recognise their duty to Australia to behave as a good corporate citizen. And I cannot see a better charity for Amazon to support in Australia than the Indigenous reading project. So, as a Kindle user and a keen consumer of their products, I do encourage Amazon.com to become a better Australian corporate citizen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the July 2012 report <span style="font-style:italic;">Evaluating new income management in the Northern Territory: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">F</span><span style="font-style:italic;">irst evaluation report</span> by J Rob Bray and co-authors. This is an important report because it cuts through much of the ideology that has surrounded new income management in the Northern Territory. It focuses on the empirical evidence relating to income management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It notes that there are few consistent impacts of new income management. Instead, there have been diverse outcomes. The report notes wide and inconsistent views and experiences of income management. There have been many who wish to remain on the program, which has had a positive impact on their lives. There has also been a statistically significant improvement in the ability to afford food among those in the treatment group relative to the control group. There were other positive and negative aspects noted. The Basics card has been valued, but the loss of autonomy resented. Some subject to income management have noted that they find it restrictive or frustrating. There is a sense of a disempowerment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more empirical evidence of this type. I commend Minister Macklin for commissioning this important research. It is only through taking a clearheaded look at the empirical data that we will be able to craft better policies. If closing the gap were easy, it would have been done by generations past. It is because this is a difficulty task that we set ourselves to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, let me acknowledge the Indigenous softball program, which I had the pleasure to be engaged with at the Hawker Softball Centre at an event last year. Softball has been a leader among sports in engaging with Indigenous Australians, particularly women's softball. There are Indigenous softball clubs springing up across urban, regional and remote Australia. I commend the work of Softball Australia in this area. Sport can help change lives and provide a sense of self-esteem and an enthusiasm to be involved in the community. Sport will play an important part in helping to close the gap. I commend the statement to the House with a sense of optimism about the goals but also with clear-eyed realism about how far we have to go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:57</span>):  I also appreciate the opportunity to speak in relation to the Prime Minister's fifth annual statement on Closing the Gap. In doing so, I would like to commend both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for the manner in which they contributed to the debate in February this year. Both the tone and the content of their respective speeches to the parliament reflected very positively on them and on their efforts to address Aboriginal disadvantage throughout our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has already been said by other speakers about the successes and the failures in reaching the ambitious targets set in 2008 in relation to life expectancy, mortality rates, early childhood education, reading, numeracy and writing, year 12 achievement and employment outcomes. I would like to acknowledge the Prime Minister's comment that this will be the work of an entire generation of Australians. We should not become disheartened by any early setbacks or indeed become complacent about any of our successes. Every gain in this space will be hard won and it will be difficult for us to consolidate those gains. As the Prime Minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Let's always remember: closing the gap is not inevitable. Keeping it closed is not inevitable either. We must guard our gains and never allow a backward step.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition remarked in his speech that this must be a national project with a focus on results on the ground. As he is a member who above all others in this place has lived the creed in terms of going out and working in the Indigenous communities and delivering practical results on the ground, I will quote from a speech by the Leader of the Opposition in which he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the sad truth is that it is easy to spend money but it is hard to make a difference. That is why it is so important that we focus on not just what is happening here in his building, what is happening here in the administration, but what is happening on the ground. The focus should not be on what Government is doing but it must also be on what people are doing in response to the initiatives of government, because it doesn’t matter what we do in this place. All our fine words, all our noble sentiments don’t matter if adults aren’t going to work and if children aren’t going to school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I endorse those comments from the Leader of the Opposition. This is about making a real difference in the lives of Aboriginal people throughout Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said repeatedly in my time in this place that you do not need to travel to rural or remote communities in the Northern Territory to witness Indigenous disadvantage in Australia. Regional towns right throughout Victoria, including in my own electorate, and right through New South Wales and Queensland provide examples of Indigenous communities struggling to meet ends meet and get ahead in their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do endorse the building blocks of the Closing the Gap initiative, which have been supported through the COAG process. It is about early-childhood development, schooling, health, economic participation, healthy homes, safe communities and governance and leadership—governance and leadership from this place and also from the communities themselves. These building blocks are very easy for us to talk about because they do make sense. It is a matter of getting the kids to school, healthy, at an early age and making sure that they are actually attending school by giving them that good start in life so that when they reach those early years of education they are ready to learn. It is helping them and their families to value an education with the prospect in the longer term that at the end of their education or training journey there will be a real job for them, and they can have their own economic independence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that we have a role in this place to help provide the leadership, but it has to be in partnership with the communities that we are talking about. There must be a level of responsibility accepted by the community leaders themselves, by the individuals and by the Aboriginal elders to help their own communities. I think we have a very important role in this place by helping to provide the framework to ensure that there is a safe living environment for those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about a slightly different gap from the nature of other speeches that have been made this evening and earlier, and that is the gap in Aboriginal participation in the social and civic life of our communities. I would argue that the relationship of most white Australians with Aboriginal people does not really extend beyond the abstract. We might cheer for them in their sporting pursuits, whether it be in the AFL or in rugby league, and some of us may have the opportunity to work with Aboriginal people in their professional capacity. We do get the opportunity to read about their issues in the media, in particular the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> has done an extraordinary job in recent years of highlighting areas of Aboriginal disadvantage in our nation. I would argue that most of my colleagues in this place—and, in fact, most of my white Australian friends—would not have a single Aboriginal person they could say is their personal friend. I would argue that most of us have never actually sat down and had a cup of coffee or shared a meal with an Aboriginal person or their family outside, perhaps, the professional role they may have in the community. There is a real social and civic life gap in the lives of Aboriginal people and the relationship with white Australia. I think there is an enormous gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and there are very few opportunities at the moment for that social engagement, particularly, I would argue, in our city or suburban locations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is probably a bit different for us who are fortunate enough to come from regional towns. We are often involved more directly in our communities, whether it is through our sporting or community activities. I would argue, still, that it does not always extend to a friendship or a social engagement between white Australians and Aboriginal Australians. Once the footy game is over  there is very little actual social interaction. I think it is to our enormous loss as a nation that we do not find the ways to bridge that gap. It is a gap that, I think, all of us can address in our daily lives. There are simple things like making sure that the young Aboriginal children in our communities are involved or included in our sporting clubs, that we actually invite the young Aboriginal children to our own children's birthday parties and go out of our way to make sure that those bridges are built across the cultural divide. I think we can extend the hand of friendship beyond the grand speeches that we might make in this place or the grand gestures of the Apology by the member for Griffith. These are all important gestures but, unless they are backed up by practical action on the ground by each and every one of us, it will all be for naught. It is all about taking some small and practical steps to understand each other and to show respect for one another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the good fortune as a young person growing up in Gippsland to know many Aboriginal people and to still regard them as both friends and family members. My family link, if you like, is through my dad's cousins, Jack and Edna, who fostered and provided safe homes for many Aboriginal people. In times of great need they provided refuge for young Aboriginal people. Theirs is quite a remarkable story. My Uncle Jack was prisoner of war in the Thai-Burma Railway. He was a POW for several years yet, when he returned, despite experiencing all the atrocities endured on the Thai-Burma Railway, he harboured no ill-will towards his Japanese captors, which I find quite staggering. When he returned to Australia he had a renewed commitment to serve others who were less fortunate than himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His calling, as he described it to me once, was to work with Indigenous people. He moved his family to a little place called Newmerella, which is on the outskirts of Orbost, not far from the banks of the Snowy River, and during his lifetime he either fostered, adopted or provided refuge for up to 20 Aboriginal children. It is an extraordinary life story. He was able to provide for them with his wife, Edna, and their own children a stable, safe family environment for these young Aboriginal people who could not, for whatever reason, live with their blood relatives in the township. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those young Aboriginal people were part of my formative years growing up. We spent a lot of time with them quite often because, obviously, with a large number of children in his own house, Jack and Edna needed a bit of respite and some of the young Aboriginal people would come and stay at our place in Sale in the school holidays. So we had a lot of exposure and a lot of experience with young Aboriginal people, and we regard them as our cousins. I am sure there was no actual blood relationship at all, but we regard them as cousins, and to this day I still regard them as my cousins. Many of those young people went on to achieve good educations, they went on to achieve stable jobs and they have been able to fully participate in the economic and social lives of the Gippsland community. At the same time, they have been able to retain their cultural identity. This is a microcosm of what can be achieved by working in partnership with Indigenous people in their own communities—making sure that they are healthy, making sure they have had the chance to go to school and achieve an education or training and then have the realistic aspiration or expectation of achieving a job at the end that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a month ago, I introduced the Prime Minister to one of those kids—one of those young Aboriginal people. I should not call him a kid because—his name is Lionel Dukakis—he is actually 50 now. When the Prime Minister visited Heyfield, I dragged Lionel out of the crowd and made him come over and say g'day to the Prime Minister. It was a great moment, and Lionel got his photo taken with the Prime Minister, and I am hoping that Lionel still votes for me in September. Nevertheless, he had his photo taken with the Prime Minister and it was a lovely moment. Lionel trained as a builder, he has gone off and worked in the mines and now he works as a cultural liaison officer with the Department of Sustainability and Environment. He has been a terrific role model for other young Aboriginal people in the Gippsland region. He has raised three successful children who have all done well in both their education and their employment. I wonder many times, when we see the extent of Aboriginal disadvantage and Indigenous disadvantage in my community, what he would have achieved and what his brothers, sisters and kin would have achieved without Uncle Jack and Aunty Edna's guidance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was great about that relationship was that it provided structure to their lives, and for a lot of Aboriginal people in my electorate there is a lack of structure. They lack positive role models. There is, unfortunately, an intergenerational welfare dependency which has developed over 20 or 30 years, and it is a blight on our community that we have not been able to help these people and rescue these people from their perilous situation. So I welcome this opportunity in this place to talk about the Closing the Gap initiatives but in doing so I hope that we continue to remember that the these fine words we hear in this place need to be backed up with action on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It concerned me as I prepared my notes for this evening's comments that, with the exception of the member for Hasluck, we have a lot of white voices in this place talking about Aboriginal issues and not enough Aboriginal people themselves in this building making a contribution to our nation's great democracy. I thought rather than just have me talk about the Closing the Gap initiatives, I would ask a few of the Aboriginal people in my community for their comments on how they thought we were progressing after five years. I asked several people in the community for their responses, and they were generally quite positive in the fact that they thought we were making progress and that we were actually heading in the right direction with the Closing the Gap initiatives. But there was, of course, a cautionary note that more needs to be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the young men I spoke to was a fella by the name of Will Carter. Will, typical of a lot of the Aboriginal boys in my community, is a gun footballer. In fact, I think he has won quite a few club best and fairests and a couple of league best and fairests as well. Will now works in the employment industry for young people, not just Indigenous people but other young people as well. He says, in relation to Closing the Gap, that it does have the right intentions—he is heartened by that. But he says that there needs to be more of a focus on the placement into jobs with the generous employers that have been so willing to be part of something so big and there are other ways it could be better approached in terms of getting the major multinationals like Coles and Woolworths involved more directly in our community. I take up Will's suggestion that the major multinationals have a lot more to offer in making sure Indigenous young people have the opportunity to get casual work and then go on to full-time employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also makes the point, and I think it is a very good point, that Reconciliation Week and other activities need to be driven by the young Aboriginal people in our community. The best place to start is the education system. He believes there are great opportunities to ensure that young Indigenous people still appreciate their own culture but also have the willingness and expectation they will gain paid employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some comments I received were from a lady by the name of Aunty Phyllis Andy. Aunty Phyllis is an absolute doyenne of my local community and an elder of the local Aboriginal people. She works with the Lakes Entrance Aboriginal Health Association and makes the point that the East Gippsland region is going from strength to strength but trying to deal with the demands of health, housing and education has become very difficult for the Lakes Entrance Aboriginal Health Association. She calls on both state and federal governments to renew their focus in the growing health needs of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last person I consulted was a fellow by the name of Wayne Thorpe, who does some great work in my community. I will quote directly from Wayne's brief email to me.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As my uncle said to me, which way is best for Aboriginal people? One way open the gap. Culture will close the gap for our people. Kids need to learn culture as well as adults. We have tried the Australian western values. It is Aboriginal culture that will fill the empty void created in our lives. When our cultural beliefs are respected and are part of our daily lives then we can engage in the other cultures of Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was from Wayne Thorpe, who is a traditional custodian of the Gunai people. These are wise words from people in my community. The general response I receive is that we are making progress. It has been a long journey and it has been extremely painful at times, but we must continue to work together for the benefit not just of Indigenous people but of the broader Australian nation. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="JK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCLELLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:12</span>):  I start by commending the member for Gippsland. I thought that was an outstanding contribution. In my 17 years, as of 2 March this year, in federal parliament, I have not sensed such a unity between the parties on any issue as on this issue. I think it is a great thing for our country and it is an opportunity to take some really significant steps. We have done a lot, but there is a long way to go. My contribution today will focus on what I believe to be a necessity in the Closing the Gap targets—that is, added to those six specific targets, we should be adding the target of reducing both victimisation and incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of victimisation, statistics show that Indigenous people are almost twice as likely as non-Indigenous people to have been a victim of physical or threatened violence. Indigenous women are 31 times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be admitted to hospital for injuries caused by assault. Their children are 31 times more likely to witness their mum, their grandma or their sister being the victim of an assault than the broader Australian community. In remote areas Indigenous people are hospitalised as a result of family violence at 35 times the rate of the rest of Australia. In Indigenous communities the victim and offender are intimate partners 60 per cent of the time as compared to 24 per cent of the time for non-Indigenous Australians. Indeed, in the case of homicides, similarly, 60 per cent of homicides in Indigenous communities are between intimate partners whereas it is one-quarter of the homicides in the broader community. These are appalling figures, and there is no question that the people who commit those crimes should be incarcerated. That is unquestionably an appropriate response to those crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, we need to assess whether our strategies are appropriately graduated. There is a strong argument that high levels of incarceration, particularly for minor offences such as traffic offences and non-payment of fines, may ultimately undermine our objective of safer communities. For instance, in New South Wales I think you have to get about 120 hours of driving experience up before you get a licence. The expense of that for some members of Indigenous communities is prohibitive. If they are at a remote location and they require transport, whatever may be the need of the journey, they will frequently drive unlicensed. The consequence of that is a fine if they are apprehended. The consequence of non-payment of those fines, in some states at least, can be incarceration. There are strategies in place, and a number of volunteers are now in Indigenous communities teaching young people to drive, to prevent the rate of fines and, consequently in some communities, incarceration. That is a lateral approach to imprisoning young people because they are driving without a licence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can give you some of the percentages in terms of the broader community. Today Indigenous Australians make up only 2.5 per cent of the population but they account for 26 per cent of the adult prison population. The incarceration rate of Indigenous adults is 14 times higher than non-Indigenous adults. Between 2000 and 2010 the rate at which Indigenous women were incarcerated increased by 58 per cent. That is, in our most recent past decade, the rate of incarceration of Indigenous women increased by 50 per cent. The rate at which Indigenous men are incarcerated increased by over a third to 35 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of greatest concern, however, is that those figures are even higher for Indigenous juveniles. Only five per cent of young Australians are Indigenous, but half of the young people in detention—in prison and juvenile detention—are Indigenous. Indeed, Indigenous young Australians are 28 times more likely to be in detention than non-Indigenous Australians. We have apologised, and we had reason to apologise, for the stolen generation. We are at the precipice of a lost generation because of the rate of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. In fact, Indigenous young people are more likely to be incarcerated today than at any time since the release of the reports of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody more than 20 years ago. In other words, the situation is getting worse; it is not getting better, and this is not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Experts have talked about the marginal effect of incarceration in terms of reducing crime. Indeed, evidence suggests today that excessive imprisonment rates, particularly for those relatively minor offences that I have referred to—fine default, traffic offences and so forth—may actually cause more crime in the longer term. Professor Dave Brown, who must be getting on a bit because he taught me at university, makes the point that prisons can become schools of crime which result in the fracturing of family and community ties, hardening and brutalisation, and poor mental health outcomes for those who have been incarcerated. After an offender is released they are likely to have lost essential life skills, have an increased reliance on criminal networks that they have built up in prison, and experience reduced employment opportunities and access to social programs. This is a profound and worrying situation in Indigenous communities because it simply leads to recidivism, where they go around the cycle again and then end up in either juvenile detention or prison. Prof. Brown also points out that studies have shown that there may be a tipping point for certain communities where, once incarceration reaches a certain level, crime in the community will actually increase. Instead of it being a deterrent, it becomes a rite of passage where it is an expectation—or indeed a thing of pride—to have served your time in prison, as opposed to what we know: that prison should be very much a deterrent and very much the local community saying that this conduct is unacceptable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerningly and tragically, this trend is intergenerational. The Corrective Services NSW Women's Advisory Council's submission to the Doing Time inquiry, which was a report of this parliament—and I commend that report to all members; I think it is an outstanding report—gave the account of one of their experts. The expert said, 'When I was going to Mulawa prison,'—this is the women's prison—'a young woman came up to me and introduced me to her mother and grandmother, who were also incarcerated.' Three generations: grandmother, mother and child were incarcerated. They had all been in custody and were all in Mulawa, in the women's jail, together. It was not remarkable to them; it was simply something that happens. That is three generations, all living generations, incarcerated in the women's prison—and I spoke earlier about the rates of incarceration of Indigenous women increasing 50 per cent from the period 2000 to 2010. If we do not turn these trends around it is difficult to see—if not impossible to see—how we are going to make the other Closing the Gap targets in terms of health, in terms of education and in terms of employment if we do not have functional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap speech she referred to the need for there to be an availability of places in educational institutions, and the Leader of the Opposition said that yes, there needed to be places in those educational institutions for young people. But he went a step further: he said that there need to be places and those kids needed to turn up. I say that they are both right, but I go a step further: not only do they need to turn up, but they need to be functional—and I can give you a firsthand example of that. When I was Attorney-General, I was taken on a tour of Kununurra one evening by police officers in Western Australia. The first thing those police officers did was take me where there were Indigenous youths on the streets—some as young as seven, they pointed out to me. The police were obviously worried about that because of the welfare of the young people, but also from the point of view of what those bored young people may get up to on the street. The next thing they did was take me to their homes a few blocks away, and that provided the answer: drunkenness was rife, with all its associated ugly antisocial behaviour; the noise, the tension—quite frankly, the sense of bedlam—was profound. I am not a small person, but there is no way that I would have walked down those streets. In fact, it was distressing to see that those hardened police officers became quite emotional in advising me that the kids we saw in the streets had to wait until alcohol induced sleep had set in before venturing back through the streets to their homes. Yet those kids were expected to turn up at school the following day and be functional. Clearly, in the circumstances that I saw, that was going to be an impossibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of successful programs. Indeed, in Kununurra, I was able to fund a program that was a drop-in centre so kids, instead of being on the street, could drop into the centre; that is one of the advantages of being a minister. I returned 12 months later and saw the centre up and running. It was pointed out to me that the cost to government of the centre was some $200,000 a year. It was pointed out to me at the same time that the cost of the centre, with capacity for 50 kids to drop in, was the cost of incarcerating one Indigenous youth. That was an example of a successful program and there are obviously more sophisticated programs to prevent recidivism that require the intervention of social workers, employment experts and so forth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of very successful programs around. As the member for Gippsland pointed out, the vital importance of those programs is that they are being developed in partnership with Indigenous communities. My fundamental point is this: there are many, many examples of very successful programs, but unless and until we make a specific target for Closing the Gap to reduce rates of victimisation—that is, people who are victims of crime—and rates of incarceration of Indigenous Australians, we have Buckley's of making the other Closing the Gap targets.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="1K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BILLSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:26</span>):  In my contribution I will not recount some of the known challenges that we as a nation face in ensuring that our Indigenous brothers and sisters achieve all that they are capable of doing. I hope to point to some opportunities that would bring about the kind of change that we all aspire to but in some respects the Closing the Gap account provided to the parliament reflects modest progress in these areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The speeches delivered by the parliamentary leaders were excellent. I am reflecting primarily on the Leader of the Opposition's eloquent words about the importance of work. Some years ago I had the honour and privilege of being concurrently the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs with oversight responsibilities for AusAID and the Parliamentary Secretary for Indigenous Affairs. One thing that frankly bewildered me was why the two policy groups did not speak more with each other to learn from each other's experiences and draw insights and inspiration from what was succeeding. As I represented our nation at the millennium development goal discussions, I had the honour and privilege of speaking in Jakarta for our region and at the UN headquarters in New York about progress. There I could point to the hundreds of millions of citizens in our region that had lifted their lives out of poverty. There was no magic bullet to doing that. It was enabled by the only durable strategy in human history that has ever worked—that is, sustainable economic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One can transfer wealth between peoples or countries and that may mitigate some of the harm you see from abject poverty and many of the social challenges that have been discussed in this debate. But to achieve a durable lift in opportunity, in quality of life, in incomes and in living standards there is no substitute for economic growth. That was clear when we applied our policy minds and rigour to our overseas development assistance, but it seems to be something that we were not prepared to talk about in our own poverty alleviation and hardship challenges here. It was as if what worked for the away game we could not talk about for the home game. To this day, I remain bewildered about that disconnect—where the learnings are not cross-pollinating between our poverty alleviation and hardship actions overseas and what we do at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I listened to the eloquent words of the Leader of the Opposition, it reminded me of a few insights that I gained over that time—insights that I urge the government today to embrace with much more vigour than I have seen to date. They were simple concepts that there is more opportunity to contribute to the economy than simply working for someone else. The Leader of the Opposition spoke eloquently about FMG and Twiggy Forrest's strategy, where he said, 'If I have the jobs I can train people for them.' That was an excellent insight into the matching exercise that is so crucial to having people see a pathway for their own improvement—in fact, how they can achieve their own sense of economic independence and individual self-determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was contrasted with some of the aid initiatives, particularly in the Pacific, where we were training people for jobs that did not exist. It was a cruel hoax on people, to urge them to engage in study and training for years when there were no economic opportunities for which those learnings and skills could be applied when they completed their courses of study. Twiggy Forrest's and FMG's approach says, 'We have jobs; we will prepare people for them.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one thing that I am urging the government to take a look at, recognising the resourcefulness and resilience of Indigenous people and Indigenous communities, is the delicious opportunity for self-employment and small business formation. I know through my travels that major investments in communities with significant Indigenous populations would be welcomed more warmly where there were Indigenous economic opportunities arising from that investment. I know that even from CDEP programs, where you see Indigenous people engaged in support for their communities, they are using the very same skills which, if supported by appropriate guidance, advice and qualification recognition, could see those very same participants transform themselves into small business people—to be self-employed. This could transform, say, some home maintenance work in a CDEP program into a home maintenance business. Yet where is the support for that kind of transformation? Where is the effort for the Indigenous community to activate and to make their own self-employment and small business opportunities in our country and, in particular, in our regions?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned, and I think a lot of it is because the government, through its own rhetoric, often would not know enterprise if they fell over it. There is this conception that the only modality of economic contribution is a person working for somebody else. Yet we know that the entrepreneurs, the self-employed and the independent contractors are crucial to our economic prospects—the courageous men and women of small business who take risks to create opportunities for themselves and for those around them, and who add an economic vitality to their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I pay tribute to Debbie Barwick—she is the chairperson of the New South Wales Indigenous Chamber of Commerce—and to Professor Dennis Foley. He is a professor of Indigenous research at the University of Newcastle. They have been onto this for some time, and I hope their efforts get more encouragement than has been seen to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is scope for it within existing funding. I am not here saying that there needs to be more money thrown at a policy solution that is not proven: no, that is not right at all. There are resources available—there is a head nod to this opportunity—but it is all backswing and no follow through. There is a need to follow through on some of the glib terminology that surrounds some program description that talks to self-employment, enterprise and entrepreneurship but then does not result in any meaningful and sustained engagement and support to see it actually materialise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of the Indigenous employment program there was a notional thought that about 80 per cent of that funding should go to employment and about 20 per cent to economic development—supporting the infrastructure that enables Indigenous people to create their own opportunities and their own businesses, and to give method and structure to their own instinctive entrepreneurial characteristics. We believe that, instead of that 80 per cent to 20 per cent split, about 97 per cent of that funding is going to employment programs and a small fraction, around three per cent, is going to economic development. Yet—I go back to my original observation—economic growth has been proven throughout the ages to be the only durable way of sustainably lifting economic opportunities and alleviating poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has the government frozen some Indigenous economic initiatives? Organisations have gone through extensive tender processes to get on panels, to have someone to hear them, only to be told that the government is not in a position to support them, and that there has been overspending in some areas—an excessive commitment of resources to employment and nothing left in the cupboard to support economic development. Big, profitable companies have been supported in implementing employment strategies, yet we have not seen any support of substance going to organisations like the New South Wales Indigenous Chamber of Commerce, a trusted, active and proven organisation to which Indigenous people can turn to support their own small business formation and self-employment opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliamentary inquiries have identified this opportunity, yet the support is not there. Even the 2008 draft, through to the 2011-18 Indigenous Economic Development Strategy under priority 4, supported the need for a commitment to organisations and agencies that could provide a one-stop shop to support Indigenous people in organising themselves and engaging with commercial opportunities, with self-employment and with small business start-ups. Yet that head nod, that acknowledgement, has not been followed through with resources. This is not to discount the action needed to alleviate the harm that others have talked about. This is about constructive steps to restore the hope that things can be better, to provide a purpose for learning that might see academic participation increase and to provide context and meaning to the encouragement from, for example, the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, in his observation about joining up the Closing the Gap education initiative to encourage a greater degree of vocational and higher education participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about saying enterprise and self-employment is crucial to the economic future of the Indigenous community but it needs support. There is chapter and verse on how—and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, in their inquiry into being 'open for business', developing Indigenous enterprises in Australia, showed this—big corporates would love to interact with Indigenous enterprises as part of their rounded approach to their economic life and to the key performance indicators they communicate to their shareholders, and on the idea of Indigenous business chambers, hubs and one-stop shop models. This is supported by the Minerals Council, which points to that very policy measure as being crucial in ensuring that small businesses are run, owned, operated and guided to the benefit of Indigenous people and in ensuring that Indigenous people are able to take up economic opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Message Stick's submission to the committee inquiry, Michael McLeod and Dug Russell, talk about the need for government to understand business and entrepreneurship and to put in place support programs that would see young Indigenous people not only recognise sporting excellence as a way out or an opportunity for individual self-determination and economic independence but also celebrate the heroes of Indigenous business. Young Indigenous boys and girls would be able to see someone had already walked that path and created opportunities for themselves and their communities. It is a grossly underdone area of the suite of policy tools that are broadly badged as the Closing the Gap initiatives. I urge the government to get behind that excellent work that Debbie Barwick and Professor Dennis Foley have undertaken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the few minutes that are left I want to point to another area where I think there is great hope, and that is private sector collaboration. I touched on it in terms of enterprise, entrepreneurship and self-employment, but I will go further. In my own community, two outstanding local people, Mr and Mrs Paul Williams, are providing Indigenous education opportunities through their philanthropic efforts in the Woomera Educational Scholarship Trust. This is a remarkable, selfless and generous statement by two local members of our community who have been very successful in their business careers and accumulated wealth that they want to put to virtuous and worthy causes. They have chosen to provide outstanding educational opportunity for young Indigenous people at some of the nation's leading schools, in particular the Peninsula School in my electorate of Dunkley.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They provide for tuition support where Indigenous people, largely from the north-west of Western Australia, come as boarders. The private trust also has to fund travel home for students who would otherwise be eligible for ABSTUDY and therefore able to reach out for travel expenses to return to their families with stories of their educational success and to reconnect with their communities where they are outstanding role models and inspirations. Yet if that same opportunity was funded publicly that travel expense would be funded and supported by the taxpayer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that private philanthropy which provides world-class education opportunities for Indigenous students should be supported, whether it is funded by the taxpayer or by remarkable individuals like Mr and Mrs Williams. I have written to Minister Garrett saying this has to be a bureaucratic oversight, that surely we want to support this sort of private initiative. Doing so would open up an opportunity to provide another scholarship for another young Indigenous person to go back to their community as a remarkable role model and a statement of what application and commitment and making the best of the opportunities within your reach can do for you. That is a message I would like to see more of in Indigenous communities. There are some examples.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate in response to the Prime Minister's report to the parliament on the Closing the Gap report for 2012. The annual report to parliament has occurred each year since Prime Minister Rudd offered the official apology to the stolen generation on behalf of the nation in 2007. I was very pleased, as I am sure many of us were, to have been able to be present in the chamber on this very significant and moving occasion. At the time I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there is so much that was stolen because of these policies and it is so important that we reach out. We do … through to an ongoing commitment to make sure that Aboriginal people's opportunities in our country are improved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I finished my contribution with the comments of many of my local constituents who also wished to express their support for the apology and the commitment to closing the gap. I concluded:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no doubt that each of us in this place will be particularly keenly endorsing and supporting the current government's commitments to closing the gap so that the apology issued last Wednesday will actually be the beginning of a whole new period for Indigenous Australians and an opportunity for them to take some of the many privileges that are their rights as citizens of this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a set of targets which included firstly, the close the life expectancy gap within a generation—that is, by 2031; secondly, to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018; thirdly, to ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013; fourthly, to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for children by 2018; fifthly, to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 and, finally, to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and other Australians by 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsequent to the apology and the COAG agreement, both Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard have provided a full report to the parliament on the release of the Closing the Gap report each year. On 6 February this year, Prime Minister Gillard provided the most recent accounting for 2012. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In introducing her report, she told the House:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Closing the Gap is a plan of unprecedented scale and ambition, a plan not only to uplift the lives of Indigenous Australians but to do so in a shared endeavour of partnership and respect. That high level of ambition commits us to two decades of annual reckoning until we bridge the gulf that stands between us. Few if any of the men and women who sit in this parliament today will still be here when a future Prime Minister delivers the final Closing the Gap statement in 2031. A short walk to this despatch box that we hope will mark the end of a monumental journey. Wherever we are on that day, the people of this land will want to hear one thing. That we have, at last, accorded Indigenous Australians the health care, education, job opportunities and community services they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a legacy that I am sure any of us would be pleased to see outlive each of our individual careers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a significant year. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report identifies, it is the 20th anniversary of the Native Title Act being passed, it is the fifth anniversary of the national apology to the stolen generations and it is the year in which the first of the targets set back in 2008 will be achieved: ensuring all Indigenous four-year-olds living in remote communities have access to early childhood education within five years—that is, by 2013. In her speech, the Prime Minister reported that the Closing the Gap target, for all Indigenous four-year-olds living in remote communities to have access to early childhood education, will be achieved this year. This is particularly important, as it is well established that the early years are critical to the establishment of healthy, happy children and that being well-prepared for formal education is an invaluable investment that more than returns the cost of the investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report itself identifies that children who attend quality preschool programs are more likely to be successful at school, stay in school longer, continue on to further education and training, and fully participate in employment and community life as adults. The report identifies the following achievements:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Data from 2011 reveals that 91 per cent of Indigenous children in remote areas are enrolled in a preschool program. This data, consistent with the governments' commitment regarding delivery, indicates that the target of 95 per cent enrolment will be met this year. The Government is working with Indigenous communities, large and small, to ensure children are enrolled in school and get to school and that the benefits of attendance are realised. Providing access to quality preschool programs is an important basis for better school attendance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am personally very interested in the education based targets for the reason that educational achievement is inextricably linked to overall improvement in life outcomes. The report on the fifth target tells us:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Results from the 2011 Census show the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Year 12 or equivalent attainment is narrowing. In 2011, the proportion of Indigenous 20-to-24-year-olds with at least Year 12 or Certificate II was 53.9 per cent—a 6.5 percentage point increase on 2006. This means progress against the target of halving the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 is ahead of schedule.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report continues in addressing the fourth target, to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous within a decade:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… between 2008 and 2012 the percentage of Indigenous students at or above the National Minimum Standards in Year 3 Reading increased by 5.9 percentage points. However, overall progress is mixed. Of the eight cases where the NAPLAN results in 2012 can be compared to the progress points set for 2012, three results are above or close to the 2012 trajectory points. In the other five cases, progress will need to accelerate if the target is to be met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her speech, the Prime Minister reflected these mixed results, including the fact that 'in year 9 writing the 2012 gap is almost double that—35 percentage points' and that 'year 3 reading actually declined in 2012 after improving between 2008 and 2011'. The Prime Minister stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I cannot conceal that these literacy and numeracy results are a source of personal disappointment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel that we would all share that disappointment and would have a determination to turn those results around and, very importantly, sustain the achievements that have been made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The full report provides extensive details on the progress of all of the targets and the related initiatives aimed at achieving the target outcomes. I encourage members of the public who are interested in this issue to look at the full report. It is undoubtedly the case that health and life expectancy, housing and employment, and security and participation are all important components of a full life to which all Australians deserve access and which far too many Indigenous Australians are often blocked from achieving. To quote the Prime Minister once more, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is the work of an entire generation and work that has begun with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel that it is a heavy responsibility that we should gladly carry as it is inconceivable that we would put this task down and walk away, as too many have done in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report to the House and, in particular, encourage people to remain committed to achieving the six targets, as I am sure that all in this House remain committed to their achievement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Chief Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:51</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Prime Minister's speech on Closing the Gap. I would like to say from the outset that the Parkes electorate, after the seat of Lingiari, has more Aboriginal people than any other electorate in Australia. According to the 2011 census, there are 21,891 Aboriginal people in my electorate. I take the responsibility of representing those people in this place very seriously. I also take it as a great honour to represent those people. But, unfortunately, an Aboriginal boy born today in the electorate of Parkes has a life expectancy 15 years less than a white boy born on the same day. The median age of Aboriginal people in my electorate is just 21. That indicates that the life expectancy is, indeed, very short of the other end of the scale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been the member for Parkes for just over five years. Achieving things for Aboriginal people in my electorate has been my greatest challenge. I do not take any joy in the fact that, of the things I do as a member of parliament—things we can all achieve as members of parliament—I should be doing a lot better for Aboriginal communities. When representing Aboriginal people, it is all about personal contact. People ask me what the views are of my Aboriginal community, and I say, 'I haven't got an Aboriginal community; I've got a hundred Aboriginal communities.' Each of those communities is individual: each has its own thoughts, aspirations and problems. The nominated targets for Closing the Gap are very relevant to the people that I represent. This is not all about bad news. There are a lot of good things happening in my electorate. The Aboriginal Employment Strategy, which has been very successful, was spawned in the town of Moree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I go around my schools, I see that the student leaders and some of the younger people are doing remarkable things. There was a young lad I first met when he was as a student at Moree High School. Last year he was a member of the youth parliament, and he came to Canberra and he mixed it with the best. He now works for a department here in Canberra and is into a successful career in the Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as we talk about Closing the Gap, I think we need to do a lot better. There have been some government decisions made over the last five years that have been detrimental to some of my communities—for instance, the removal of the CDEP. While it was far from perfect, and while it was never intended to be permanent employment and in some cases ended up being such, it was at least something. When the CDEP was removed from the village of Toomelah, the overall situation in that community deteriorated quite a lot. Unfortunately, quite often, from Canberra, we do things with lines on maps. In 2008 Toomelah and Gunnedah—which was then in my electorate—Narrabri and Moree were no longer considered to be remote and so CDEP would be removed. Now that line has moved further west and the communities of Coonamble, Walgett and Lightening Ridge are going through the same pain. While in theory it may be fine, and these services will be replaced by other providers, it does not take into account the personal relationships that are involved in providing these services. In all these country towns, the personal relationships that you build over a period of time are particularly important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is that, if we are going to do the best thing by our Aboriginal people, we must not accept lower standards than we would for the rest of the community. By accepting lower standards and glossing over the problems, and praising things that are less than adequate, we disrespect those people we are trying to protect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is a big issue and is at the core of a lot of the problems in my communities. But it is not that there is a lack of work—unfortunately, the nature of my communities, and the nature of employment with agriculture, is such that a lot of the work that Aboriginal people did has now changed. The real challenge is to give the younger people the skills required to take up those positions. It is a great disappointment to me that we have people from all over the world working during the wheat and cotton harvest, and in the foundries, the workshops and the mechanical shops in my electorate that could be done by local people—but that has to be addressed through education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to speak about another couple of issues. One of the programs I am working on at the moment is in relation to the coalition's Green Army policy, should there be a change of government at the next election. I would be very keen for a training program, particularly the Boggabilla-Toomelah area, into full-time work in skills of resource management—weed control, river bank stabilisation: outdoor manual work that would be appropriate and that these people would enjoy. On the Macquarie River trails there is a great program, RiverSmart, looking at highlighting the benefits of the river, basically to help ensure the health of the river but also to promote it for tourism. It is a wonderful opportunity for Aboriginal employment, not only in constructing walkways and things like that, but also in guiding and tourism type work. That is something that I certainly hope we can get off the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another shining light in my electorate is the Currawah Adventist Aboriginal College. The Seventh Day Adventist Church have constructed a boarding school at the village of Gongolgon which is about 100 kilometres south of Brewarrina on the Bogan River. I went to the opening of the school and I was very, very impressed with what the Seventh Day Adventist Church are trying to achieve. They are drawing children, mainly from disadvantaged families and dysfunctional homes, from right across eastern Australia and the children are going to the school in the middle of, basically, nowhere. Those school children went to Canberra last year. They were well presented, enthusiastic and keen to learn about our parliament. They were as good as any school that I have escorted around this building. They were a real credit to the teachers and staff at the Currawah Adventist Aboriginal College, and those boys and girls were also a credit to themselves. That college is in danger of closing. They were hoping for some sort of financial assistance, maybe through Aboriginal Hostels Limited, particularly from the government to keep going. They will be in Parliament House tomorrow or the day after for some meetings to try and obtain funding assistance to keep the school open. That is real benefit and real achievement and is making a difference in these young people's lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to close by speaking about the Clontarf Foundation. I have just come from a function where the Governor-General was the special guest as the Patron of the Clontarf Foundation. Of all the programs I have seen since I have been an member of parliament in any sphere I have never seen a program that has been more successful in obtaining the outcomes that they desire than the Clontarf Foundation. The foundation have four academies in my electorate that have been open for less than 12 months. Last Tuesday morning I had the privilege of attending the Clontarf Academy in Moree. I went on the bus with the tutors and we picked up the kids from their homes. The sun was not up—it was pitch black—but the kids were ready to go. We had an hour of training in rugby league. It started off in Perth with Aussie Rules but it has been adapted in New South Wales to Rugby League.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twelve months ago many of the boys were not attending school. One boy had missed a whole year of school. They were now enthusiastic and were attending school. They were polite and respectful and they had a real purpose in their lives. As a member of parliament very rarely do you actually get to see a program that works like that. There are many places where the Clontarf Foundation could roll out. At the moment, I think, there are 9,000 boys in the academies across Australia. The foundation have identified double that number that could benefit from the academy. I would recommend all members in this place to look at the work of the Clontarf Foundation. There is a great potential to help the boys in Dubbo, Wellington, Nyngan, Cobar, Lake Cargelligo, Condobolin, Narrabri, Walgett and any other number of possibilities. Tonight we heard from a man, Geoffrey, who is 28 and who started with the academy as a teenager. He was a wayward Aboriginal boy and is now fully employed as a boilermaker working in a mine. He has a partner and two children. The Clontarf Foundation have helped him all along the way and now he is being a real father to his son and daughter. He spoke tonight—and it is as good a speech as I have ever heard in this place—about his lifelong journey from an errant boy who was not attending school to a proud father with full-time employment raising two children in Western Australia, if anyone wants an endorsement of what this can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The apology given by Kevin Rudd in 2008 is still very special to the Aboriginal people in my electorate. They talk about it still. That was a milestone. But we really need to embrace programs that work. We need to accept no less a standard for our Aboriginal brothers and sisters than we do for ourselves, and we need to put our energy, our emotion and our commitment into genuinely closing the gap so that by the time these children are adults the Aboriginal community and the Australian community are one, in every aspect of their lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  I want to commend the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their fine speeches in parliament in relation to Closing the Gap targets, delivered annually. Across Australia, according to Reconciliation Australia, governments spend about $25 billion a year on programs aimed at closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. But, sadly, the trust between both groups is still too low, and there is still perceived prejudice between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Nearly half of all Australians believe it is harder to achieve success if you are an Indigenous person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have seen some improvements. We have seen betterment of our Indigenous brothers and sisters, but it has been too slow—painfully slow. We have seen reconciliation action plans initiate so many improvements in the lives of people, and I commend those companies—there are currently about 358 organisations with reconciliation action plans. These are focused on employment, Indigenous business and education, and there are even pro bono organisations. There are others concerned with cultural competency. It is known that reconciliation action plans improve the contact between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The attitudes—the pride, the prejudice—will go. And they improve trust. As the Chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the House of Representatives, along with the deputy chair, the member for Murray, I have written to the presiding officers because there is no reconciliation action plan in this parliament. We are urging the presiding officers to think of a reconciliation action plan for this particular place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other things I want to say, but first I want to mention the fine speech by the former Attorney-General, the member for Barton, and commend him on his 25th Lionel Murphy lecture: 'Vigilance against injustice in the justice system'. As I heard him speaking tonight I recognised the tenor of that speech. I commend to those who may be listening, and to other members, this fantastic speech by the former Attorney-General in relation to the challenges regarding the injustice that is experienced by Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we did the <span style="font-style:italic;">Doing time—time for doing </span>report we discovered, as the member for Barton said, that in the 20 years since the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody the condition and situation for Indigenous Australians has got worse. Indigenous juveniles are 28 times as likely to be in detention as non-Indigenous juveniles. Indigenous juveniles make up more than one-half of the detainee population on any given day in Australia. Indigenous young adults are 15 times as likely to be in prison as non-Indigenous young adults. Sadly, the dysfunction continues across generations: poverty, despair and despondency—simply the expectation that as a rite of passage you would visit and live with your parents and grandparents in incarceration premises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We made many recommendations in our report. These were motivated by the prisoner census data, which show that between 2000 and 2010 the number of Indigenous men and women in custody increased by 55 per cent in the case of men and 47 per cent in the case of women, and also that if you were an Indigenous woman you were 35 times as likely to be hospitalised by partner abuse as a non-Indigenous woman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We made many recommendations to the government: endorsing justice targets that states and territories in the Commonwealth could come to, supporting an inclusion of safe community building blocks, and also putting serious money towards getting agreement across the jurisdictions for this. We also recognised the social norms that impacted families and communities through mentoring, sport and recreation: the fact that there were fewer people able to be mentors to Indigenous boys particularly; the fact that FASD—foetal alcohol spectrum disorder—was such a curse, particularly in Indigenous communities. I commend to the government the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, chaired by the member for Moreton, and its many recommendations in relation to FASD—a report which flowed from our <span style="font-style:italic;">Doing time</span> report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I commend the many recommendations made. The idea that finally FASD be recognised as a registered disability—that is, a condition for eligibility for support services in health and education systems—is something which needs to be done in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to look at better alternatives to Indigenous young people entering the criminal justice system. We need a more holistic intervention. The New Zealanders had Maori youth courts. We have not got much empirical evidence across the Tasman, but we can certainly see that the anecdotal evidence supports alternative systems for Indigenous people. Sadly—I did not intend to make a political speech here—the Murri courts in my home state of Queensland have been closed down by the LNP state government. This is a terribly retrograde step, a really bad result for the Queensland community, and I think it is going to cost the Queensland community not only in dollars but also in social justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that we look at education. One of the things we discovered was that schools which were connected to Indigenous communities did better—their kids did better. A perfect example of that is in my community. We have a very large Indigenous community in Ipswich; we have Indigenous medical centres and schools, but Leichardt State School—Lee Gerchow is the principal there—is probably as well connected to its 25 per cent Indigenous school population as any other school in Ipswich. The school's improved results since its better connection with the Indigenous community are outstanding. We have put a lot of money in there—$723,000 recently for support programs, mentoring and cultural improvements—but that is because the school took the initiative; that is important. We should focus more upon that in our school communities. Simple things like amplification devices in schools—too many Indigenous young people cannot hear properly, and we need to think seriously about that; more school pools and better pools and recreation facilities in Indigenous communities. Things like alternative accommodation—we found that too often Indigenous people had nowhere to go so were kept in detention—and alternatives for bail so that they can get out. We do not have the data collection in this country to see the full extent of the challenges we face. The member for Barton, in his fine speech in the Lionel Murphy lecture, talks about these issues. The government has taken up many of these things that we have recommended, and I urge it to be more vigilant about those sorts of things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that our committee has recommended—the government is yet to respond; it is to do with Closing the Gap—deals with a report called <span style="font-style:italic;">Our land our languag</span><span style="font-style:italic;">es</span>. We dealt with what Paul Keating said in his Redfern speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mabo was a very controversial decision on 3 June 1992. At the time of white settlement in this country, there were 250 Indigenous languages; there are now only 18 viable Indigenous languages in this country spoken across all generations. We have not done enough maintenance on the revitalisation of Indigenous languages. There is so much more that we can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our report <span style="font-style:italic;">Our land our languages</span>, we made an number of recommendations, including the recommendation to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… include in the Closing the Gap framework acknowledgement of the fundamental role and importance of Indigenous languages in preserving heritage and improving outcomes for Indigenous peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have recommended twice now—twice—a national Indigenous interpreter service. We did it in our <span style="font-style:italic;">Doing time</span> report—it had been done 20 years before in a previous parliamentary report—and we did it again in <span style="font-style:italic;">Our land our language</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>. We recommended to the government a national interpreter service, and I urge the government to think about this. Too many people go to jail, too many people get poor diagnoses on health outcomes—go to the Northern Territory and you will find this—and too many kids have an inadequate education because we have not got a national interpreter service. We need that, and we have recommended it to the government in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Our land </span><span style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> languages</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Doing time</span> reports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Doing time</span> report, come up with another inquiry—it is underway and we are going to report in May—that is, the role of sport in closing the gap. The participation rate in sport for non-Indigenous Australians is 74.3 per cent, while, sadly, it is only 65.5 per cent for Indigenous Australians. The difference is even worse for Indigenous women. The reality is that not enough sporting organisations have reconciliation plans. The evidence we have heard in the public hearings is that the AFL and the NRL are doing a great job; they are doing great work. Some of the sporting organisations, at our public hearings and on the public record, could not even tell us how many Indigenous people play their sports. They could not tick a box; they could not tell us what efforts they were making to help Indigenous young people. There is not enough sporting equipment—not enough barbells and dumbbells, tennis courts, pools, football fields and basketball courts, not enough basketballs and footballs—and sporting organisations just go in there, fly-in fly-out, do a clinic, and then go away and leave these people on their own again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not enough effort is being made in sport to close the gap. I look forward to our report and deliberations. I expect it to be a bipartisan report, as were the other two. The member for Murray has been a tremendous advocate in this area; we have worked very closely on this issue. I expect some very strong recommendations from this committee in relation to this issue, but we have a lot to do. It is not just about plucking elite athletes from Far North Queensland and the Northern Territory to go and play in the NRL and the AFL; there is a lot more that we can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Dunkley mentioned business. We are doing a lot in helping business. In my area, we have an Indigenous Business Enterprise Centre established with seed funding from DEEWR—federal government funding. We have seen 85 Indigenous people go into full-time work in 18 months in my community; the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre has an Indigenous focus as well. I want to give an example of a particular individual. I am proud to say I have his painting of honey ants in my electorate office. His name is Robin 'Tallman' Wakkajinda and he is a local artist. He had drug problems and he had alcohol problems. He comes from Gayndah, from the Wakka Wakka Jinda tribe. He is a mentor. This fellow is a fantastic artist. He has turned his life around with the support of the local IBEC. He is a business success. I was pleased to be there with the Mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, to help open Robin's exhibition of his paintings at the Old Ipswich Courthouse. They are brilliant. I have seen this fellow go around with young Indigenous people in my community. They love him. Sadly, he is disabled in his hand, but he is one of the most brilliant artists you could ever see. His artwork sells for lots of money and he has turned his life around. He is a business success. He has talent, and with the support of great people like Clive Pearce, from the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre, he has succeeded. This is the sort of help that we can provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding was given via a flexible funding pool to develop and pilot a unique enterprise program in Ipswich. This is an Australian-first initiative, and that is what we have got to do. I am all for rights, but we have got to have responsibility as well. People have got to pick themselves up. We can give them a helping hand to do that and we have got to get them on their way. We live in a free enterprise economy. People want to develop their talents and their dreams and their potential, and 'Tallman' is a perfect example. If we do this across the country, the member for Dunkley will be proved wrong. We can do it. We should fund it. Have a look at those reports. We should support the likes of the IBEC in Ipswich with additional funding. It is an Australian first. This should be a prototype for Indigenous business enterprise centres across the country. We should do it. I commend the Closing the Gap target. This will help in closing the gap if we do it across the country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:20</span>):  Regardless of where Australians live, there is little doubt they are moved by the plight of Indigenous Australia. Attitudes and knowledge vary markedly from our major cities where many people have met few Aboriginals and have little firsthand knowledge of the issues and circumstances facing people of Aboriginal descent, to regional towns and outback communities where residents deal with the reality of Indigenous communities living within their midst, with both the successes—and there are many—and the excesses and failures of the system and individuals and the penalties the larger community pays for those failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was encouraging to hear the Prime Minister report the increase in mainstream Indigenous employment from 42.4 per cent in 2006 to 44.7 per cent in 2012. While I have no hard figures to back this up, I think I can see small but positive improvement in my major regional communities, in places like Port Lincoln, Port Augusta and Ceduna, where there is apparent growth in Aboriginal families with mum or dad, or both, at work, living in better housing, driving better cars and getting their children to school. There is still quite a way to go in many instances, but I sense that progress is being made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Employment is simply one of the most important, if latter, keys to the puzzle. I say 'latter' because long-term productive employment is very difficult to achieve if an individual has poor education, poor language skills and a negative experience of being raised in a dysfunctional household. This is no truer with Indigenous communities than with the population at large. Not having a stable and loving household, good language skills and a reasonable education does not mean an individual cannot break the barriers and become a productive, fully integrated member of our society, but it elevates the degree of difficulty many times. So while the apparent rise in employment is encouraging, it is a concern that by far the majority of Indigenous jobs are in the government sector and, more particularly, in the Aboriginal industry. That sector should play an important role, but we will never achieve true equality in Australia until the workforce is truly integrated. While we have jobs that are perceived as black or white, prejudices are reinforced rather than broken down. It is important for the general advancement of Indigenous Australians that they are seen as 100 per cent part of mainstream Australia, and to do so they need to be represented in the mainstream workforce at similar levels to the mainstream population. However, I add a point of balance and congratulate those in the resources sector who have made a dedicated effort to raise Indigenous employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, I am more encouraged than discouraged with the progress in employment in regional centres. However, it is in the remote communities where I fear outcomes are at best stagnant. All of the remote Indigenous communities in South Australia are in my electorate. Aboriginal communities like Oak Valley and Yalata in the west, Nepabunna in the central region and the APY lands in the far north are joined by regular towns of mixed populations like Coober Pedy, Oodnadatta and Marree. In all, those who identify as Aboriginal in my electorate make up about seven per cent of the population, or 10,000 persons. Of that, about 4,000 live in remote communities. The biggest group of these live in remote, isolated Indigenous lands, and by far the best known of these are the Anangu, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands in the far north-western corner of the state, where about 2,500 people live. The APY lands are by no means the only area where the problems exist, but they are a very useful tool for assessing the issues facing communities closer to the mainstream because they are in every way isolated from the rest of the state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is in the APY lands where the gap is the largest and, despite the very best efforts and an annual expenditure by the taxpayer of between $150 million and $250 million—it seems that no-one has any real idea how much—it is difficult to see progress. It is worth pointing out that this is around about $100,000 a head. Huge amounts have been invested in housing, schools and health clinics. While further housing would be desirable, these physical facilities are by and large very good—the kinds of facilities that most communities in Australia would be happy with. But it occurs to me that despite the best efforts of those who work within them, the net result in most cases is no improvement. There is a paradox that exists in these communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I try to visit the APY lands a couple of times a year. It is a one-week trip each time. My guess is that there are around about 80 different organisations on the lands, government and non-government, all trying to make a contribution to improving the lot of the locals. When I speak to people from any of these organisations they give convincing and enthusiastic evidence that they are making a real difference and closing the gap, if you like. I must say that when I look at the work most times I am convinced. However—and here is the rub—if all these programs and organisations were doing such a good job, then why aren't we making progress? Why in most cases are things getting worse? Why are there communities that are theoretically at least alcohol free with still unacceptably high levels of alcohol- and drug-driven violence? Why is there sexual assault on minors, very poor school attendance, astronomical incidence rates of diseases like diabetes and impaired hearing in up to 95 per cent of the children?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Noel Pearson has argued far more eloquently than I ever will that the root cause of these evils is passive welfare. He is right. Helping people is a double-edged sword. When we assume responsibility for a commitment in a person's life that would normally be their responsibility, we diminish their future obligation to perform the task. Eventually, if we do it often enough, everything becomes the government's responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from the art centres, there are almost no business enterprises on the lands that provide employment outcomes that are not dependent on government. They are the only businesses on the lands that produce a tradeable resource, thus actually providing genuine market-driven work-related income to the communities. In the very high expense environment of the APY lands, even the art centres are not able to be self-supporting industries and require ongoing taxpayer support. However, they are the best that we have and I congratulate them for their progress and sincerely hope that the market will continue to support the growth of these centres. Virtually all other jobs related to income come courtesy of the taxpayer in industries providing services to the rest of the population or in environment driven jobs where locals are funded to care for country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting as this parliament is presented with more legislation on native title that the APY lands are owned freehold by the communities. That is not title guaranteeing access, not traditional ownership and not pastoral leases but the most secure title to land available—freehold. It was gifted to the Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara people by the Tonkin Liberal government in 1981. While I support Indigenous people to establish their links with the land, I send a strong word of caution to those who think that ownership in any form is the silver bullet that will address the breakdown of traditional culture. The APY lands are a 32-year demonstration that that is clearly not the case. In so many areas, things are no worse, and that is certainly in the area of employment, alcohol and drug abuse and levels of literacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in some ways I wonder if the granting of ownership has made things worse. One would wonder how that could possibly be. Perhaps there was an air of expectation that with ownership would come wealth and the work to generate that worth was expected to be performed by others. Certainly jobs on committees and on boards, accompanied by cars and travel benefits, are seen as real jobs. Jobs cleaning schools and health centres cannot be filled and have to be performed by teaching and medical staff. Perhaps it was the interfamily battles over the spoils that to this day debilitates attempts at governance. Appalling governance has led to repeated failures. The APY Lands Council, for instance, has once again just recently been bailed out by the state government to compensate for funds that have been lost to shoddy management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are truly to close the gap, there must be a consolidation of the plethora of local boards ultimately funded by taxpayers on the lands. The amalgamated bodies must be given more responsibility but also face a far greater responsibility to meet the same demands of probity that local government must meet. If these bodies cannot meet those levels, as with any local government that suffers chronic failure, administration must be installed. Part of the malaise of remote Indigenous Australia is that we set a lower expectation of Indigenous communities. That is, we set the bar lower. Eventually this is totally unproductive and leads to accepting lower employment performance, lower standards in schools and lower levels of compliance with the law of the land. The idea that we accept this because people are Aboriginal is condescending. It is offensive and racist and should not be accommodated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will draw your attention to the schooling system for a short while. Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on schools on the APY Lands—in one case as much as $4 million at a school which is now closed barely four years later. Yet for all this expenditure, according to the study collated by Professor Mark Hughes, an academic extremely well regarded in this area, South Australia is the worst performing state in Australia in Indigenous education, according to the NAPLAN information. The schools in themselves are fascinating and seem to be mostly staffed by dedicated teachers. Teacher-student ratios are extremely low. Breakfast and, in some cases, lunch programs are common. A plethora of travel, excursion and life education programs exist. Yet attendance rates are appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The attendance issue is exacerbated by cultural activities, with perhaps the most disruptive and unpredictable being sorry camps. These camps are yet another example of how the culture of the Indigenous peoples has been distorted by its head-on collision with the modern world. I visited a sorry camp that had been sitting for almost 6 weeks, camped in the rubbish which accumulates around such camps and within 800 metres of a small town with running water, toilets, housing and showers that was empty for the duration. There were infants in the arms of mothers amongst the flies and filth, and children some hundreds of kilometres from home, absent for weeks from their normal schools. Traditionally, the deceased would have been buried within a day or two. The cultural guardians of the Anangu simply must sort this issue out, and I acknowledge that they are making some efforts to do so in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To return to the schools, apart from sorry, attendance is still an issue, and I am pleased that at least there has been a move to income management on the lands, albeit as a voluntary model at this stage. More than 250 people have signed on to the program, and it is at least implied that the compulsory management may be enforced if parents fail to get their children to school, although it is yet to be seen whether governments are prepared to commit to the tough love required to enforce this outcome. I watch that space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Classroom teachers are faced with the dilemma of trying to get children to school with no other incentive than making learning a fun experience with small bribes. It is concerning to see children dribbling into schools over an extended period in the morning. This is hardly an ideal start to the day. The problem with having to be constantly entertaining and fun is that the core tenets of education get demoted. This is a tragedy because we know that those lessons are the ones which will, in the long term, deliver the mainstream jobs that I spoke about earlier. I have spoken before in this place about my visit to Cape York, and I am very pleased the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth is here to hear this. The Cape York Institute is run under the direct instruction method by Noel Pearson, and I can only say that all of Australia's remote communities should be interested in the package. I urge the South Australian government to at least make the package available at some trial sites in the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this raises this issue of the difficulty of ever closing the gap in this remote world where there is no genuine economy. Certainly we must support these communities and allow the adults of today to live their lives as best we can provide for. But every effort must be made to break the cycle and educate the next generation to equip the new generation, as Noel Pearson says, to walk in both worlds. That means having good English language skills. It means having strong basic maths and an understanding of the social demands of living in the outside community. Denying these children those keys means that they are tied to a region where there are few jobs, and it will condemn them to the uselessness of a life on welfare. I do not doubt the good intent of the political class in Australia to address the deep-seated problems of remote Indigenous Australia. But I think in so many cases we are addressing the symptoms rather than trying to apply a long-term vision to the issues at hand. What is needed is an independent analysis of the economic possibilities of the communities and honest assessments of the population these communities are capable of properly supporting, and then making appropriate and evidence-based decisions about their future. Maintaining, supporting and encouraging new generations to live in communities that cannot ever support them will not only destroy the individuals but will destroy the culture of those whose future we are seeking to advance.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HV4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GARRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:35</span>):  I want to follow on from the member for Grey's contribution and spend a moment reflecting on and acknowledging some of those remarks that the member made. It is the case that he serves an electorate where there is a significant amount of social disadvantage amongst people, particularly those living on what is referred to as the APY lands. The member posed the question to the parliament: why aren't we making progress? He was also prudent enough to acknowledge that the political class, as he put it, does want to see delivery of greater achievement potential for people in regional and remote Australia for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but thus far, notwithstanding the amounts have been appropriated to the goals and the many programs and efforts of a range of successive governments both at the national level and at the state level, we cannot say with any great degree of pride that we have succeeded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not presume to have the intimate knowledge of the member's electorate that he has, but I think part of the answer, particularly when we look at the educational attainment levels of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote communities, is the remoteness. The fact is that Aboriginal people are in a particularly difficult situation if they are still living effectively within clan culture on country and a long way away from the services and the economic and social activity that characterise our regional centres, our suburban Australia and our cities. The disjunct between the way in which people still want to live there and the way in which the remainder of the Australian polity organises itself is a great one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member, I have been to a number of communities and seen what I think are some signs of disengagement that are at such a level that you really do wonder what the prospects for young people growing up in these communities will be. At the same time you see underneath that the great strength of family and culture that has seen people occupy these lands for tens of thousands of years. In part it is the time that we live in, the time that we are here as legislators, as politicians, in this parliament when we are witnessing that great gap. I think it is to the parliament's credit and to the credit of governments that there has been a national intention to try and close the gap, recognising that it is there, and that the Council of Australian Governments itself, the highest council in the land, if you like, has set itself this task. But it is by no means easy and I do not think there are any quick or convenient solutions. One thing I do know is that we have to persevere, that we have to have open and honest dialogue. We have got to try policy initiatives but we have also at all times got to engage and involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to communicate to the member for Grey that I have had some invitations to visit the APY lands. I hope to get out to that part of Australia sometime in the not-too-distant future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I was remarking, the Closing the Gap framework has six targets set by the Council of Australian Governments. It is a national approach to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We did have some good news from the Prime Minister recently when she spoke to the parliament and reported on Closing the Gap and also an identification of the areas in which we need to do much better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children do start school developmentally behind. So it was particularly satisfying that the Prime Minister was able to announce that the first of the six targets had actually been met, and that is that all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander four-year-olds in remote communities have access to early childhood education by 2013. That is particularly important for the prospects of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on community, because it is at the very early stage of life when their brains are still in what is described as a high degree of plasticity, and also learning habits as well both of young people and mums in particular can be engendered and there can be confidence that when kids go into a schooling system, which is quite often subject to disruption, as the member for Grey pointed out, that they are able to still keep learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to reflect on the levels of investment from government. I do sometimes hear contributions and read commentary about whether or not money is or is not well spent. What I can say is that with the investments we are putting in the National Partnership Agreement on Early Childhood Education, we are seeing more children than ever participate in preschool or kindergarten programs. So I think to that extent with this result it is definitely an investment that is bearing some fruit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also on track to half the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander year-12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates by 2020. That is pretty important, because the transition from school to work is one which is a significant and sometimes almost unreachable journey for many young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Halving that gap in year 12 attainment is a huge part in equipping them for the prospects of either future study or potentially work as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quickly addressed in NAPLAN tests as well, because we did have disappointing results in the 2012 NAPLAN tests. I think it is important to remember that the trend from 2008 to 2011 was actually quite encouraging and we need to keep building on that. We will have ACARA, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, examine the 2012 student performance to see if there are underlying reasons in that result. I can actually identify some of the reasons, particularly in the Warlpiri triangle, where we have a growing population of young people enrolled in school but in an area that has been subject to some significant community unrest over the last 18 months to two years. There, I think, the opportunities that children had to attend school regularly unfortunately were reduced; notwithstanding that, we are seeing improvements, particularly in reading. We are seeing some improvements in year-3 reading both across Australia and more specifically in some of the states with a high proportion of Aboriginal kids in remote communities. We are also seeing some improvements in year-5 numeracy. But there is no question that there is much more to be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we need to do in terms of making sure that we are maximising the opportunities for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to both achieve well at school and go on to work as well? One of the things that has been particularly important has been to do work with another eminent Aboriginal educator, Dr Chris Sarra, and his Focus Schools Next Steps Initiative, to which we provided significant assistance—funding of about $30 million. There are a number of focus schools where the focus is particularly in this case on improving school attendance, on classroom engagement and the academic achievement of around 9,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. That is done in cooperation with states and territories who are running the government school systems where the majority of young Aboriginal students are, through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan agreed by the states to support children's readiness for school, building good practice in schools, developing community based school leadership and parental engagement, and boosting attendance and literacy and numeracy. There is significant investment from this government of around $128 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan identifies 55 actions at a national, systemic and local level. It has been endorsed by COAG. I think the key thing about the plan is that it is not just a bunch of words that governments have agreed to; it is a set of specific actions, which we need to see every single school that has a proportion of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students attending, apply themselves to. It is my intention, under the National Plan for School Improvement—the response by the government to the recommendations of the Gonski review—that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan will be given greater focus. I am disappointed that in some states we have not seen school systems apply themselves specifically to that plan, given the amount of work that went into it and the fact that it identifies the range of components that you need to have operating at the same time in a school setting over a consistent period in order to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student attainment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the members listening would know, we have investments in Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory, and that includes some school attendance measures which are described. And we are providing an additional 200 teachers for literacy and numeracy support. Of course, we have maintained support for the school nutrition program at a cost of around $9 million per year in the Northern Territory. People and members listening would know that this government—and governments in the past—have provided support through ABSTUDY. As well, we have provided opportunities for students to attend school through boarding facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak briefly about attendance, because attendance is one of the greatest challenges in making sure that young Aboriginal students can progress through their school careers. Regrettably, attendance is poor from day 1 in year 1, and it gets worse by year 10. I can see, in Western Australia for example, government schools recording a gap of 13 per cent between year 1 Indigenous students and others. And that gap goes up to 24 per cent by year 10. The figures are actually worse in the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My School reports attendance rates for all schools. For schools in Indigenous communities that have a 100 per cent, or almost 100 per cent, Indigenous school body, there is a year-on-year tracking of attendance. But the fact is that without attending school consistently, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students will not develop the skills and education levels necessary to effectively operate in the job market so that they can take care of themselves over time and support their families and their communities—nor will they reach their full potential. It is something that requires urgent attention. I know that it is on the minds of education ministers, teachers and others working in the regions but it is something that requires commitment by communities and families, as well, recognising that a good education for a young Indigenous student is a passport out of poverty. We do now have schools and teachers who are ready, willing and able to teach, but it is important, now, that the kids are at school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I attended the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Conference in Darwin in 2011. We had a range of presentations, including by principals of schools where they had succeeded in bringing their kids through both primary school and secondary school by doing a number of things. They underscored the priority areas: readiness for school; engagement and connection with community; attendance, which I have referred to; leadership in quality teaching and workforce development; and consideration of the post-school opportunities. Where these six areas have been addressed by leadership in schools, through the principal and the teaching community, and where the community and family—and, where necessary, local authorities—are engaged, then we start to see a difference in education outcomes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at a school like Bega Valley Public School in New South Wales, where students are benefiting from strong leadership and evidence based whole-school processes monitoring performance, I see targeted support at the school, personalised learning plans and the employment of an Aboriginal school learning support officer—just those things. This is not that far from here—just down the coast—and what have we got? We have NAPLAN results show an increase in the proportion of students who achieve above the national minimum standards in year 5 in reading and numeracy by 26 per cent and 21 per cent respectively over 2008 and 2011. As well, the proportion of highest performing students in year 5 reading and numeracy have increased by 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Another example that is well known to some of us is Cairns West State School in Queensland—again, concerted case management, a teacher coaching program underpinned by high expectations, and significant improvements in results in the school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, we will continue to commit ourselves to closing the gap. In this parliament, that is amongst our most urgent tasks. Some progress has been made. We acknowledge it and we welcome it, but we recognise that there is a great deal more that we need to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  It is a pleasure to follow my colleague the member for Grey and certainly the member for Kingsford Smith, the education minister. I know the work he has done through his music, with Midnight Oil, to help the Indigenous cause in singles such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dead Heart</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Beds are Burning</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Truganini</span>. We can all sing along—as I often do when I am driving to Canberra on a Sunday night—to Midnight Oil. I do not always agree with the member for Kingsford Smith, but certainly his music touched the hearts of many. At a time when Indigenous issues were far more controversial than they are now, he helped in some sense to close the gap before Closing the Gap really became a common phrase in Australia. I know he has worked as a parliamentarian since 2004, and I acknowledge him for that—for doing what he can to help bridge that divide between Indigenous Australia and the rest of society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments committed to six targets to help close the gap for Indigenous Australians. These targets relate to life expectancy, infant mortality, education and employment. <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap—Prime Minister's report 2013 </span>outlines that there are still serious gaps across the board. Even the Prime Minister herself has stated her personal disappointment that it appears that they are failing to close the gap. I commend the Prime Minister for her words in opening this particular—I will not call it a debate—series of speeches. It is not a debate; it has bipartisan support, for something that really is important to all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recall the fine words of the opposition leader, who goes out of his way each and every year to live amongst Aboriginal communities to see how tough they are doing it. I know that if the coalition is fortunate enough to be voted in as the government and he becomes the Prime Minister he will do some fabulous work in this important area for all Australians and particularly for Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders live substantially shorter lives than the rest of the Australian population—up to 20 years less in some cases, with the current gap generally estimated at 11½ years for males and 9.7 years for females. That is not acceptable—not in this day and age. It is simply unacceptable. Over the past 30 to 40 years there has been a decline in Indigenous mortality rates while life expectancy has increased, and that is good. While the rise in life expectancy is good, it will be challenging to meet the target. Whilst working towards increasing Indigenous life expectancy, non-Indigenous life expectancy will also be on the rise. The 2013 report says that the target of closing the gap on life expectancy will not be met until 2031, and that is still a long 18 years away. Health outcomes also need to be achieved to help combat mortality rates, with circulatory disease, cancer, injury—including, sadly suicide—respiratory disease, and endocrine, metabolic and nutritional disorders being the leading causes of Indigenous mortality between 2006 and 2010.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The target to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five years of age by 2018 is on track, thankfully, and can be achieved, based on mortality rates between 1998 and 2011 declining at a rate of 29 per cent, faster than the decline in non-Indigenous mortality rates. Ensuring access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2018 is set to be achieved this year—and that is fantastic. The target sets the benchmark at 95 per cent. It is a shame it is not 100 per cent, but 95 per cent at this stage, given what would have been the case perhaps even only a decade ago, is still certainly a staggeringly good statistic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Data from the new National Early Childhood Education and Care Collection showed that 91 per cent of Indigenous children in remote areas were enrolled in preschool programs in August 2011. The Prime Minister's report states this target will be met, based on the latest available data and the commitment by state and territory ministers to the target. Progress on halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous children by 2018 has been only mixed, based on NAPLAN data. Currently, only three of the eight literacy and numeracy outcomes are on track to be reached by 2018. That is unfortunate. The data also revealed that Indigenous students in metropolitan areas are achieving significantly higher results in literacy and numeracy than those in rural areas. We all know that the tyranny of distance is such a factor in that regard. Seven per cent of constituents in the member for Grey's electorate are Indigenous and I know how remote some parts of his electorate are. I have visited those areas of the Northern Territory and Western Australia and even New South Wales and outer Queensland where the great distances are certainly a factor in disadvantaging Aboriginal children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is promising progress on halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rate by 2020, with the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians closing by 4.3 per cent, whilst attainment rates amongst Indigenous students grew faster than amongst non-Indigenous students. However, to meet the target there will need to be continued rapid improvements from 2011 to 2016, according to the Prime Minister's report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2011 census data shows the gap in total employment outcomes has widened since 2006 by 2.2 percentage points, which is due to a decrease in the proportion of Indigenous Australians aged between 16 and 24 against a rise by non-Indigenous Australians in employment. This data works against the target of halving the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and other Australians by 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Riverina had almost 7,000 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons identified in the 2011 census, with a very young median age of 20 and an almost 50-50 split between men and women. I spoke with Roger Penrith, who is the Indigenous community liaison officer at the Griffith City Council, to ask him what outcomes he would like to see achieved under Closing the Gap. Before I talk about Mr Penrith's comments, I should commend also the member for Gippsland on his extraordinary contribution to this series of speeches earlier this evening, in which he spoke of his personal experiences but also of the outcomes that they are achieving in his Gippsland electorate. It was, as I say, quite a remarkably good speech. The member for Gippsland always makes good speeches, but this one was of particular relevance. Anybody who is perhaps reading these words should backtrack in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> to a bit earlier in the evening and read that contribution by the member for Gippsland. It was quite a wonderful speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Penrith identified four key areas which need further attention in his local community. These were health, housing, community and aboriginality. Whilst there are some key improvements amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, Mr Penrith mentioned that there are still a number of ongoing health issues that Indigenous persons in his area are struggling to overcome. Many people are still not seeking medical treatment for matters relating to the eyes, ears, nose and throat and in Griffith there are a large number of Aboriginal children who are not being treated for otitis media, an ear infection which can have long-lasting effects on hearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Aboriginal people are also not seeking dental treatment, which has the potential to create further health issues. Oral health is such an important issue amongst all Australians, but it is particularly important for Indigenous Australians. Whilst a simple filling may not seem like a life-and-death matter, the risk of infection increases and, in turn, has the potential to make someone extremely ill. If Aborigines were accessing dental care, this may be able to circumvent later medical visits for illnesses related to the initial problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of child mental health, which Mr Penrith raised with me, has also been brought to my attention by many other Griffith organisations. People of Griffith would love to see a headspace organisation in their region. I have spoken to the member for Reid about a petition I have received with almost 2½ thousand signatures and he is helping me to ensure that it is tabled in parliament, because Griffith and the entire Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area needs such a facility to help give children, particularly Aboriginal children, a place to go to seek assistance in a friendly and safe environment. There are serious concerns about access to emergency housing for clients. Mr Penrith signalled that whilst there are houses designated for Aboriginal people these are also being offered to non-Aboriginal persons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A wealth of talent and experience is held by many Aborigines within the business community. The Griffith City Council would like to see more enterprise opportunities made available by both state and federal governments for Aboriginal business, as well as more consolidated funding and better funding opportunities. Griffith is an extremely multicultural city—it puts out flags for 100 different nations on Australia Day. I believe it is the cradle for multiculturalism in Australia. There are concerns about non-Indigenous persons getting access to assistance reserved for those who are Indigenous. There is a feeling amongst the local Indigenous community that a more stringent process needs to be put in place to ensure that funding which is directed towards only those who are eligible and need it the most actually reaches that particular group of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One organisation in the area which is making great progress in helping Indigenous students gain year 12 qualification or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 is Tirkandi Inaburra, located between Coleambally and Darlington Point. Tirkandi Inaburra is managed by Anthony Paulson and is a community-run development and education centre offering Aboriginal boys aged between 12 and 15 a residential program aimed at reducing future contact with the justice system by strengthening cultural identity, self-esteem and resilience. I heard a lot of the speakers earlier this evening talking about the higher than proportional incarceration rates for Indigenous people. This is something that really needs addressing, not just by people in this place but by our state parliamentarians as well, to ensure that those incarceration rates are substantially lowered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be eligible to apply to become students at the wonderful Tirkandi Inaburra centre, the boys must live in communities located between the Lachlan and the Murray and between Balranald and the western side of the Blue Mountains. The boys must be prepared to make a commitment. They must be first time and/or non-serious offenders who are willing to make the shift to change their lives. They may be dropping out of school and are catching the attention of the police. If successful, the boys embark on a three- to six-month journey where they engage in educational, sporting, recreational, life, living skills and cultural activities which have been developed especially to develop their skills and abilities. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and Deputy Leader of the Nationals, Nigel Scullion, has visited this centre and believes it is so good it should be replicated across Australia. It is unfortunate that this is currently the only centre in Australia offering this particular opportunity. We should be promising more such centres in an effort to help achieve the goal of more graduates by 2020 and, in doing so, to help close the gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is on the way to closing the gap, but there is still significant work to be done by governments right across the country. Speaking of Tirkandi Inaburra, I had a visit on 20 February with the Clontarf Foundation's Chief Executive Officer, Gerard Neesham, its Chairman, Ross Kelly, and also Brendan Maher, who is in Parliament House tonight for a dinner for the foundation. It is an education and mentoring program for Indigenous youths to discuss plans to help better their lives and provide educational outcomes. I know the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Julie Bishop, has had a powerful influence over the years in helping to promote and fund Clontarf, which exists to improve the education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal men and, in doing so, equip them to participate meaningfully in society. It has certainly played a great part in helping realise some of the Australian Football League dreams of young Aboriginal boys and it is now trying to branch into rugby league. If Aboriginal boys see that there is a pathway for them to a better life through sport such as football it helps their educational outcomes as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundation believes that failure to experience achievement when young coupled with a position of underprivilege can lead to alienation, anger and more serious consequences. As a prelude to tackling these and other issues, participants are first provided with an opportunity to succeed and, in turn, to raise their self-esteem. Gerard Neesham is a wonderful fellow. He is a former AFL coach. He is a wonderful motivator of people and he has a particular love and passion for improving the educational outcomes for young Australians, particularly young Aboriginal Australians. I commend him for his wonderful work with Clontarf. I hope the government sees fit to give Clontarf the funding it requires to help replicate this right across Australia. Gerard Neesham had important meetings in Wagga Wagga and throughout the Riverina to help develop the sort of program that is needed there. I commend Gerard for his work and I commend Clontarf for its involvement with Aboriginal youths. It is certainly helping to close the gap. Finally, can I say that improving the health outcomes for Aboriginal people is a wonderful initiative and we as parliamentarians should be doing everything we can to help that cause.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Permanent residents have several channels by which they may be informed prior to their departure, of the need to obtain a Resident Return visa (RRV) to allow them to re-enter Australia:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The visa grant notice issued to successful applicants for permanent visas outlines the initial entry expiry date, the travel facility (multiple entry), and the 'must not arrive after' date. It also states that the permanent visa holder is able to remain in Australia indefinitely. Permanent visa holders are also generally given information in that notice about their ability to travel out of and into Australia until their specific 'must not arrive after' date (five years from the date of grant of the permanent visa), and the need to apply for an RRV should they wish to travel internationally and re-enter Australia after that date. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The department's website provides information for Returning Residents by following the links provided at: www.immi.gov.au/migrants/residents/</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Clients contacting the department through the client service phone line (131881) seeking clarification of their eligibility to return to Australia on their current permanent visa, are advised to check the expiry of the travel facility on that visa, and where required, provided with advice about the RRV. Where a permanent resident has a visa label evidenced in their passport, the valid travel facility is indicated by a "must not arrive after" date stated on that label. Alternatively, a permanent visa holder can check the details of their visa (including any expiry dates) using the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) service at: www.immi.gov.au/e_visa/vevo.htm </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) There are two Resident Return visa (RRV) related system prompts used at the border for departures. These prompts appear on a Customs and Border Protection officer's screen when the travel component of a passenger's permanent visa has expired or will expire within 14 days. The Customs and Border Protection officers are trained to advise the passenger that the travel component of the visa has expired, or will be expiring, and that they must hold a valid RRV before returning to Australia. They are also asked to advise the passenger that they may be unable to board their return flight if they do not have a valid RRV. Where a passenger requires further information they are referred to an officer of the department.</span>
