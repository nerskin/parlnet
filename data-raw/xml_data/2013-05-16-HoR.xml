The incorrect orientation of the caskets was identified and the caskets were correctly oriented before being flown back to Australia.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia remains committed to transparency and providing information on civilian casualties in Afghanistan. The ADF takes the question of civilian casualties very seriously. The ADF operates under strict rules of engagement intended to minimise civilian casualties, and deeply regrets any loss of innocent life. In my February update to the House, I advised on outstanding inquiries into suspected civilian casualty incidents. In the materials I present and will table in the House later I provide an update on those incidents and one additional incident.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rule of law is an essential basis for international relations and for national security policy. On the ground in Afghanistan, the law of armed conflict—including the principles of military necessity, proportionality, distinction and discrimination—provides the framework for Australia's rules of engagement. International humanitarian law provides the basis for Australia's detainee management framework in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ADF has built a reputation over the years for professionalism. The ADF has prided itself on its high standards and it has a well regarded international reputation for doing so. When, for example, there are incidents involving possible breaches of the rules of engagement, such as in relation to civilian casualties, they are investigated and the results of those investigations are made public. Similarly, where there have been possible breaches of the detainee management framework, they are investigated and the results of those investigations are made public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These two foundation principles—the rule of law and transparency—have served the ADF and Australia well in Afghanistan. Australians can be rightly proud of the professionalism and honour with which the ADF has conducted itself in Afghanistan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:55</span>):  I rise to lend a few brief comments in response to the Minister for Defence's detailed statement he has made to the House this morning on Afghanistan. I thank him for his statement and his commitment to keep the House informed across these range of matters. I rise today to reiterate once again the very strong tradition of the coalition that we offer and take seriously bipartisan support for combat operations not just in the wider Middle East area of operations but wherever Australian soldiers, sailors and air men and women serve. Our support has not wavered on this. It has been universal. We have given support for the last six years of combat operations, especially when it has been difficult and hard. We also support the combat force wind down in Tarin Kot and the handover of the Tarin Kot base to the Afghan National Army and the residual clean-up and logistics handover work that goes with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise also to join the minister in thanking our fighting men and women for what they are doing. It remains tough and difficult work. Our hearts and our prayers go to them as they continue to uphold the great traditions that our military has borne for so many years. The coalition's bipartisan support goes to the detainee management framework, governance monitoring operations and reporting as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join the minister in noting we are a First World nation. We abide by the rule of law, particularly in armed conflict. Concepts such as rules of engagement and orders for opening fire are not simply acronyms; they are an important basis upon which we as a First World nation prosecute our combat operations. It is important to note that our enemies do not follow such a distinguished way of operating. Let the other nations of the world judge them and let the nations of the world judge us by our standards. I agree with the minister that our standards are high and that our accountability is strong, yet we remain open to criticism and we confront it when it is raised. We are not afraid for this nation's parliament to point out where we may have erred, what we have done to investigate it and how it has been resolved. Australians should be proud of that degree of openness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the detainee numbers in the last 20 months have risen to 1,898 suspected insurgents. That is an enormous number of insurgents for our soldiers ostensibly to have captured on the battlefield, suspected or stopped at roadblocks or in other areas. That is an enormous rate of effort for our troops in understanding the environment and ensuring that local civilians are safe from insurgent activity. It is a testimony to our efficiency in operations. I also note that the recapture rate is exceptionally low considering the very high number of detainees. That speaks volumes about our capacity in terms of our tactical questioning, our interrogation capabilities and the entire process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the minister for his update on the allegations of mistreatment by Australians of insurgents. I note that they are all properly and thoroughly investigated. I note that 90 per cent of allegations of mistreatment were at the point of capture. That is quite understandable when those being captured do not want to be captured and put up a degree of resistance. Nor is it surprising that 100 per cent of the allegations have been found to be untrue. Nor do I find it surprising that the insurgents that we fight continue to fabricate stories even when conclusive CCTV footage shows that what they are saying is absolutely, palpably and completely untrue. Again, you can hardly find a greater dichotomy between the way we prosecute operations and the way our insurgents prosecute theirs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the minister's comment on the suspension of transfers to the National Directorate of Security detention facility in Tarin Kot. Is my contention that if the minister is concerned about allegations he is right to suspend transfers, and he has done so. I note that those allegations do not surround any of the ADF transferees, and I note that this is a completely Afghan-run facility. I also note that the one ADF transferee detainee that was at the facility at the time of the suspension has been visited. I understand from the minister's statement that he has personally advised that he has not been mistreated in any way. The ADF has, then, ensured that its duty of care to its detainees has been properly met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">MINDEF has also raised with the Afghan authorities—indeed, with Afghan Foreign Minister Rassoul personally—our disappointment at what is happening in the facility, and I believe that Minister Rassoul is investigating this appropriately and thoroughly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the minister for his update on the initial screening area within TK, and I note that when the Tarin Kot base closes for ADF involvement and is handed over to ostensibly the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army, that initial screening area will close and the team will move out in line with our ADF troop withdrawal. I also thank the minister for procedural misconduct and regulation updates. I note the investigations and we note the outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also note the minister's update on the incredibly regrettable instances of civilian casualties. We acknowledge the investigation officer's report into areas where Australian troops have been involved. We note the CJOC response and I also note that there are some reports outstanding. I still remain concerned, Minister, at the time that is being taken for these reports to eventuate. It is a concern, I believe, you may well share as well. Again, I reiterate our request that more resources, if needed, are applied to ensure that reporting does not continue to be delayed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join the minister in concluding that we praise our fighting men and women for what they have done. Their professionalism is of the highest standard. Their accountability is of the highest standard. In terms of accountability for the prosecution of combat operations, in the history of Australia's war craft, this conflict would have to be the one where our men and women are held to the highest levels of accountability—where the reporting is thorough, where individual instances are investigated thoroughly—and we as a nation should be incredibly proud of that. We are a First World military. We take our combat operations and the legalities and the rules of engagement around that seriously. We are not above the law. Indeed, we are a standard-bearer for the law on the grounds upon which we fight. I think we are all very proud of what our men and women are doing overseas. I am, I know the minister is and I know the parliament is. I thank them for the great work they are doing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Bill 2013 (PGPA Bill) will establish the framework necessary for a modern public sector; the framework needed for a modern government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would establish a Commonwealth financial framework that is simple, adds value for all and is easy to use. The bill is the cornerstone of a broader reform agenda to modernise government and create a streamlined and adaptable public sector that is able to meet Australia's changing needs into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current Commonwealth financial framework, comprising the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act)<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act), has been in place since 1998.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These acts have served the public sector well. But in the 15 years since the current financial framework commenced the demands on the public sector and the expectations of the community have changed significantly. We have seen our financial framework slip from world's best practice over a decade ago to being adequate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deficiencies with the current framework will, over time, become an increasing drag on the performance of the public sector. For example, the current FMA Act is highly prescriptive, and yet at the same time is silent on the management of risk. The existing framework is also very linear—it is focused on straight lines of vertical authority and creates significant hurdles to citizen-centric service delivery and collaborative working practices both across government and between the government and other sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the view of this government that the Commonwealth's financial framework should underpin a productive and innovative public sector that is able to adapt to increasing community demands and changing circumstances, while still retaining robust systems of management and accountability proportionate with the relevant level of risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reflecting this, and recognising the short comings in the current framework, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation announced the Commonwealth Financial Accountability Review on 8 December 2010. The review was tasked with identifying opportunities for reform in the public sector financial framework that would improve productivity, performance, accountability and risk management.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PGPA Bill will provide the legislative architecture for maximising the opportunities identified by the review. The new single act would strengthen public sector capability by creating a coherent and consistent approach to governance, performance and accountability within the Commonwealth. Unlike the current two act framework, the PGPA Bill would, as far as practicable, apply a consistent principles-based framework to all Commonwealth entities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are several key principles that form the basis for the reforms proposed in the PGPA Bill. These principles are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">(1) Government should operate as a coherent whole.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">(2) Public resources are public resources, and a common set of duties should apply to all resources handled by Commonwealth entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">(3) Performance of the public sector is more than financial.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">(4) Engaging with risk is a necessary step in improving performance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will briefly outline the key elements of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PGPA Bill does not alter the operational independence of entities, as provided in an entity's enabling legislation. Rather, the bill emphasises the prominence of enabling legislation and seeks to create a consistent resource management framework applicable to all Commonwealth entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="page-break-after:avoid;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new single act would introduce a common set of duties. The duties would apply to all officials who use or manage public resources. This reflects community expectations that public resources will be managed prudently and efficiently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of these duties align with the fiduciary duties contained in the Corporations Law, and have also been developed drawing on requirements under the Public Service Act Code of Conduct. The benefit of drawing from these sources is to promote mobility across the private, not-for-profit and public sectors, and also facilitate greater partnering across the leadership levels of entities. The benefits of this are already evident in the context of bodies under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act<span style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>This bill will ensure such benefits are achieved across the full spectrum of Commonwealth entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;" />
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Third, planning and evaluation.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PGPA Bill seeks to link the key elements of resource management to establish a clear operational cycle of planning, measuring, evaluating and reporting results to parliament, ministers and the public. In particular, the bill will, for the first time, explicitly recognise the value-add of rigorous planning, performance monitoring and evaluation that goes beyond financial reporting. The bill would achieve this by, among other things, requiring entities to develop a corporate plan to monitor, assess and report performance to a set of transparent standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;" />
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Fourth, risk management.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Risk management is a key feature of modern management. The public sector deals with risk every day and at all levels, from senior managers to the front line of service delivery. Eliminating risk is not practical, and so the public sector needs to manage risk by engaging with it. Additionally, acceptance of manageable risk is a necessary element of innovation. When managers do something new, when they work out a better way to deliver a service to the public, or develop a new policy option, it will involve risk. Something untried always will. But, within the right risk framework, this is precisely the innovation we want to foster in the public sector—it is the approach that will drive performance and better outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To recognise this, the PGPA Bill seeks to place a greater focus on risk than has been the case under the current FMA Act and CAC Act framework. The bill seeks to bring about cultural change by placing a duty on entities to establish appropriate systems of risk oversight and management and by introducing the principle of earned autonomy—a model for escalating internal regulation—where appropriate. Earned autonomy involves being able to tailor regulatory approaches to individual entities, based on clear risk metrics. The approach is akin to world leading practices in regulation and compliance adopted by APRA, ASIC and the ATO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;" />
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Fifth, cooperation.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the increasing complexity of service delivery and the needs of the community, the PGPA Bill seeks to encourage cooperation between Commonwealth entities themselves, and partners such as the states and territories and the not-for-profit sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current framework is not set up to handle arrangements spanning jurisdictions and economic sectors. The PGPA Bill seeks to enable entities to deliver services and solutions across these boundaries, in a more timely and efficient manner, by placing a positive duty on the heads of entities to encourage partnering and also to consider the effect of compliance burdens when dealing with partners. This will be particularly important for the not-for-profit sector as it plays an increasingly important role in delivering the services that many Australians rely on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;" />
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sixth, accountability.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PGPA Bill seeks to strengthen and simplify accountability under the Commonwealth's resource management framework through: a greater emphasis on performance reporting in the legislation; greater clarification of the relationship between ministers and Commonwealth entities; and greater clarification in annual reporting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The first new air warfare destroyer, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hobart</span>, is due for delivery in 2016. The air warfare destroyer ship sustainment facilities project will provide permanent maintenance, systems support and infrastructure at Garden Island and training facilities at Randwick Barracks and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Watson</span> in Sydney New South Wales.</span>

At Garden Island there will be berthing infrastructure upgrades to the walls and a new shared three-storey office building to accommodate personnel involved in maintaining and keeping the ships operational. At Randwick Barracks there will be new air warfare destroyer training centres for crews which also co-locate and share certain facilities with the landing helicopter dock training centre. At HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Watson</span> there will be a new air warfare destroyer command team trainer to practise and hone the ship's command teams in the profession of maritime warfare. </span>

Capital investment in the project will have economic benefits for the Sydney region and local industry with significant opportunities for subcontractors in the construction industry over the next three years. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works should proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence later this year and be completed by late 2015. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Broadcasting Commission, the ABC, currently operates three sites in Melbourne: one at Southbank and two at Elsternwick. In 1999, the ABC purchased the site immediately adjacent to its existing Southbank Centre with the long-term objective of consolidating all its Melbourne based staff and operations, with the exception of television outside broadcast operations, on one site at Southbank. The proposed Melbourne Accommodation Project will achieve this objective together with a range of other ABC strategic, functional and financial objectives.</span>

The proposal also aligns with a range of government policy objectives in the areas of the transition to digital television and digital radio services in metropolitan areas, environmental sustainability and the delivery of high quality and diverse broadcasting services including international television. The project involves construction of purpose built accommodation on the site immediately adjacent to the current Southbank broadcast site in Sturt street, Southbank. The consolidated facility will house all ABC radio, television and online production in Melbourne as well as broadcast and support facilities. The estimated cost of the project is $176.4 million, including project management, design, construction, building fit-out and the ABC's broadcast technological fit-out.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry currently leases and operates five post-entry quarantine facilities for the management of imported animals and plants under the Quarantine Act 1908. Existing leases on all properties are due to expire between 2015 and 2018 with no opportunities for lease extensions. The new facilities are required to satisfy contemporary quarantine standards and meet all future demands, particularly in the area of high-risk species. A single consolidated facility has been determined to be the best option to respond to this need. The proposed post-entry quarantine facility project will be delivered by the Department of Finance and Deregulation, which owns the project site and facility. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will operate and manage the proposed entry quarantine facility. The estimated cost of the proposal is $293.1 million plus GST and includes all of the costs associated therewith. The land for the project was purchased in Mickleham, Victoria, at a cost of $35 million in June 2012, utilising funds provided for this purpose in the 2011-2012 budget. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these projects and works proceed. Subject to the parliamentary approval, the construction will commence in late 2013 and will be completed by late 2018.

The ADAS program aims to provide the Australian Defence Force with a multidimensional manoeuvre capability to support the Australian Defence Force's Future Joint Operating Concept. The two new Canberra Class LHDs will replace the heavy landing ship, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk</span> and the two amphibious landing ships, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Manoora</span> and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanimbla</span>.</span>

Construction of the LHD superstructures and their consolidation with the hulls are then conducted by BAE Systems in their Williamstown shipyard in Victoria. The first LHD hull arrived at the Williamstown shipyard in October 2012. The first completed LHD, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span>, is due for delivery in early 2014.</span>

I might add that DHA has undertaken a massive investment in the Brisbane and Ipswich regions in the past few years as a result of the expansion of the military bases located in Brisbane and at Amberley in Ipswich. This has been a major boost for South-East Queensland, particularly in relation to construction and tradesmen. It has also brought in a massive amount of money into South-East Queensland.</span>

The current townhouses will be replaced by seven new townhouses and 48 apartments, all of which are to be occupied by Defence members and their families. This opportunity to redevelop an existing DHA owned site will meet the dual goals of greater housing choice and a reduction in rent allowance in a location where the majority of commuting by both the members and their families can be by walking or accessing public transport. The estimated overall cost of the project is $24.6 million including GST and escalation costs, but excluding the cost of land. Subject to parliamentary approval, demolition and site works are scheduled to commence in March-April 2014 with construction to be completed by October 2015.

                    </a>  The committee considered two matters: whether the disclosure led to a potential or substantial interference with the functioning of the committee and the source of the disclosure. On the first matter, the committee concluded that the capacity of members to work collaboratively and the ability to conduct private proceedings in an open and frank matter had potentially been interfered with. For an individual to take it upon themselves to disclose a confidential committee report undermines the integrity of the committee system. The committee also noted concerns that the consistent reporting of confidential committee reports in the 43rd Australian Parliament has all but eliminated the practice of committees issuing embargoed reports, limiting the capacity of the media to publish in an informed way the important work of committees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the second matter, the committee sought assurances by statutory declaration from all members, their staff and staff of the secretariat that they did not release details of the report to Mr Probyn. All declarations bar one confirmed that the individual did not release details of the report to Mr Probyn or any other unauthorised person. However, Mr Tehan's declaration stated that he did not disclose details of the report to Mr Probyn but that he had consulted with a third party in the preparation of his dissent. Mr Tehan has apologised to the committee for his actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also questioned Mr Probyn as to his source and he refused to reveal his source, citing professional journalist ethics. Nonetheless, the committee notes the Standing Committee on Privileges and Members' Interests report of August 2012 that found the publisher of unauthorised material to also be culpable for the publication of that material. While it is up to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to make determination about further action on this matter, in light of the facts of this case and the views expressed by Mr Probyn and his legal counsel as outlined in this report, the Regional Australia Committee has expressed serious concerns about the attitude of journalists and publishers towards the rules of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee has concluded that it would be beneficial for further action to be taken on this matter as it must be made clear to the Parliamentary Press Gallery the seriousness with which the House takes the publication of unauthorised disclosures. For this reason, the committee has recommended that the matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges and Members' Interests. The committee has also recommended that the House adopt the Privileges Committee August 2012 report in order to give effect to its important recommendations aimed at assisting the House and its committees with these matters and better education of the Parliamentary Press Gallery. Mr Deputy Speaker, the committee asks you to examine and consider this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.</span>

                    </a>  I am glad that the minister is listening closely to what I have to say. In his address to the 40th anniversary celebration of the Australia Council, its Chair, Rupert Myer, put the council's history in its proper context. This is a direct quote from his speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"In November 1967, then Prime Minister, Harold Holt, informed the House of Representatives that a new Commonwealth agency would be formed to fund the arts in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That new body, arms-length and administered by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, with support from officials from other relevant government departments, and people from the arts, the law, the financial sector, and other areas of professional life, met for the first time under Prime Minister Gorton in July, 1968.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It assumed responsibility for theatre, arts and filmmaking and existed alongside the other agencies responsible for the arts—the ABC (symphony orchestras), the Commonwealth Arts Advisory Board (Visual Arts), the Commonwealth Literary Fund and the Commonwealth Assistance to Australian Composers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some of these had been in existence for most of the last century."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let there be no doubt that the Australia Council has always enjoyed, as it continues to today, the support of both Labor and Liberal Governments over the past half century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator George Brandis, the coalition's most recent arts minister, in 2007 addressed the National Press Club and detailed some aspects of the coalition's support during the Howard government years. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... funding for the Australia Council, which makes direct, arms' length grants to individual artists and performing arts companies, has risen from $73 million 12 years ago to $161 million in this year's budget—an increase of more than 110%.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So when the coalition talks about our concern for the future of the Australia Council, these are concerns borne of a longstanding and committed history of support for the organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is in keeping with that longstanding commitment to the Australia Council that today we remain concerned that these bills propose what can only be considered the most radical changes in over 40 years to the body that administers the bulk of Commonwealth grants and funding to Australian artists and arts organisations. According to their most recent report, the Australia Council administers around $164.5 million in Commonwealth grants and direct funding to artists and arts organisations across the nation. The Australia Council provides Commonwealth funding to everything from Australia's major performing arts companies, like the Australian Ballet, the Melbourne Theatre Company, and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, to the wide range of community and regional arts organisations across Australia—around 170 of them in total. This bill and its associated bill seeks to introduce a radically different management structure, one which may not need actual artists and, for reasons that still remain unclear, makes changes to the list of legislated functions that the Australia Council performs. The coalition notes today that the minister, having publicly noted he did not favour amending these bills, has now capitulated and allowed for some amendments that acknowledge the government's more embarrassing oversights, like forgetting about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does not oppose these amendments and it will not oppose these bills in this chamber. But that said, even with these amendments, the coalition remains concerned about what is contained within these radical changes. We also note that the government has not explained why it has waited until there were only 12 sitting days left in the Senate before introducing these bills. Nor has it explained why the review of the Australia Council was released in May 2012 and it has waited for nearly a year before introducing this legislation. Despite these failures on behalf of the government, we do not oppose these bills and these measures but we do remain concerned about the impact of these radical changes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  As a keen fan of the arts, particularly dance and visual arts, and as a former director of the Cultural Facilities Corporation here in Canberra, it gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, which is particularly close to my heart. I have experienced first-hand both in Australia and overseas the important work of the Australia Council. While working for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I was privileged to hold the position of cultural attaché to India. In this position, and also while working in Indonesia, I grew to understand the important role the Australia Council plays in showcasing the breadth of Australian talent to the world. While in India in 1996, Australia managed a huge intercountry promotion where we showcased everything about modern Australia and technologically advanced Australia. Through showcasing Australian in five cities over the course of a year, we had the opportunity to highlight some of our achievements in the arts—in dance and in visual arts. We had a major Indigenous exhibition, probably the largest that has ever been to India, hosted in New Delhi and the Australia Council played a very, very important role in making much of that happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was particularly important about that year in India was the fact that the Australia Council hosted a week's conference where they met with their Indian counterparts to explore ways of engaging in further dialogue on the arts in every element of the arts and in further collaboration and mentoring as well as residences and a range of other activities. So I know from my own experience of being in foreign affairs, that the Australia Council plays a very active role in Australia but also internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Indonesia we also hosted an intercountry promotion in 1994, I think, and again, it provided us with the opportunity to highlight the range of artistic genius that is available in this country through dance, through visual arts, through musical works and a range of other activities as well as residences. It provided the opportunity for artists to engage with other artists in a range of collaborative efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a long and proud history of supporting arts and culture. In 1908 the Commonwealth Literary Fund was established in order to provide pensions for needy writers or their families. This was the first of many boards and funds that would proudly support Australian artists over the years. It was under the Whitlam government in 1973 that the decision was taken to establish a single statutory body whose role would be to provide a coherent framework for the arts in Australia, encompassing the roles of many of the previously existing boards and funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1973, a new but interim body, the Australia Council for the Arts, was established and it sat within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Then in 1975, the Australia Council Act was passed and the Australia Council was established as an 'arm's-length' statutory authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The enabling legislation for the Australia Council is now 40 years old, and it is time that our proud tradition of supporting the arts is brought into the 21st century. The legislation we are debating today will ensure that the Australia Council has the capacity to adequately reflect the diversity, innovation and excellence of Australia's contemporary arts and cultural sectors. It will also ensure that the Australia Council is well placed to support the goals of Australia's national cultural policy, Creative Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key features of this legislation is the reform of the Australia Council's artform board structure to allow for greater funding flexibility. Currently, every member of the Australia Council's artform boards is appointed by the responsible minister. This bill devolves that power and gives the council new flexibility to engage expert responses to the demands of the sector. Under this legislation, the council's governing boards will have the power to appoint sector-specific advisory committees. This reform will empower the council to appoint a greater diversity of artists as peers to help support the strategic planning and funding assessment processes of the council. It is a particularly important role. This reform will mean that artists will be more easily and directly involved in deciding how the Australia Council funds projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the premier arts organisations in my electorate of Canberra and its surrounding region is the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. Founded in 1950, the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, or CSO, has grown from amateur beginnings to its current position as the largest professional performing arts organisation and the largest employer of professional musicians in the region. It is also one of the only professional pathways for talented young musicians in the Canberra region. As the only professional Australian symphony orchestra with an Australian chief conductor and artistic director, Nicholas Milton—who is brilliant—the CSO is also a leader in the performance of Australian repertoire. Since 2007 the annual program of seven concerts has included at least two Australian works each season and in 2013 it will feature two world premieres and one Australian premiere of works by Australian composers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vision of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra is to create and foster symphonic music of the highest quality, to serve as a regional hub for music and to secure the future of fine music performance in the Canberra region. The CSO also engages in a fabulous program called Noteworthy for little kids. I have been to a number of these sessions, where members of the orchestra, dressed up in the Wiggles type outfits, introduce young children, aged from about three to nine or 10, to the wonders of live music performances and the wonders of classical music. The sessions only go for half an hour, because the attention span of children at that age is relatively limited, but what is wonderful about them is that the members of the orchestra gets these little children crawling around the floor like little tigers and flying like birds throughout Llewellyn Hall to wonderful pieces of music. This wonderful program is supported by the ACT government and it is a great way of introducing small children, our future generations, to the wonders of classical music in particular. Classical music is so important to provide soul food. From a young age I studied ballet, so at that stage I was introduced to classical music. It is particularly important that you get an understanding and appreciation of classical music at a young age and it can mature as you mature.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To achieve its big vision, the Canberra Symphony Orchestra requires a commitment of recurrent additional funding. The CSO first received Commonwealth funding in 2007 as a result of the Strong review into Australian orchestras: $100,000 a year was approved and has been received annually since then. In 2013 the CSO will receive funding through the Australia Council of a total of $101,606, plus GST. This funding is significantly less than comparable state orchestras receive. In fact, this constitutes just 0.2 per cent of the total of $48 million in funding distributed to Australian state orchestras annually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite receiving significantly less funding than the other state symphony orchestras, the CSO, on a proportional basis, delivers outstanding results. It has the highest percentage of corporate sector and philanthropic support; it has the highest percentage of income earned outside of government funding; and it has the lowest government subsidy per seat, at $14—three times lower than the next orchestra, with some orchestras receiving a subsidy of over $150 per seat. Proportionately, it has the second highest ticket sales after the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Most importantly, it has extremely high subscriber loyalty, with an annual retention rate of over 90 per cent, which I am sure most arts organisations would kill for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the reforms that will be implemented under the legislation we are debating today will, hopefully, allow for the more appropriate funding of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. I implore the future governing board of the Australia Council, and the future music advisory committee it appoints, to favourably consider the case of the CSO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is not just the CSO or my electorate that will benefit from this legislation. Across the country, countless worthy arts and cultural organisations, big and small, will benefit from these reforms. Artists will have new access to the Australia Council and new opportunities to influence its strategic planning and funding assessment processes, which is particularly important. This legislation will enable the Australia Council to become increasingly responsive to the changing needs and demands of the arts sector, including supporting emerging areas of artistic practice. These bills provide for the much-needed modernisation of the Australia Council and I commend them to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="4V5" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MOYLAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak today on the Australia Council Bill 2013. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge some of the country's amazing people committed to the administration of the arts and to its promotion in Australia. I have met a number of them and they are truly extraordinary people. They work not just for money but because they are truly committed to artistic endeavour in this country. I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding talents of artists in Australia and the contribution they make to the quality of life, providing a great deal of enjoyment to all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But mostly I would like to raise some concerns in relation to the bill which were brought to my attention during a recent meeting with Andy Farrant, who is the former chief executive officer of Country Arts Western Australia and Regional Arts Australia. Andy held those positions during the Howard government and did an outstanding job in that field, taking arts to the broader community. Indeed, I think the community was well served under the Howard government policy and by the then minister, Rod Kemp, who served with distinction and gave great support to the arts community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Farrant has explained that many in the arts community, not just himself, are concerned about the wording of functions of the Australia Council in this bill which fails to enshrine the four fundamental principles of community participation, arts that reflect the diversity of Australia, upholding and promoting freedom of expression, and the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill changes the intent of the Australia Council and it does seem to abandon some of the core principles on which successive Australian governments have built their vision for an Australian culture. In fact, there seem to be a number of inconsistencies in this bill with other important policy and legislative instruments that have come before this parliament. For example, there is an inconsistency between the principles contained in the national cultural policy, Creative Australia, and the Australia Council Bill. There is also an inconsistency between the stated functions of the Australia Council in this bill and the Australian Sports Commission Act, and between this bill and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to revisit a little of the history, because I think it is instructive. The Australia Council is Australia's primary funding body for the arts, focusing on the highest levels of artistic endeavour. After its creation in 1968 as a division of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, it was established in 1973 as a separate agency operating at arm's length from government. It was Dr HC Coombs who described the conditions in the sector that led to the Council's conception and ultimate creation. He said that at that time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the performing arts professional companies, with one or two exceptions, were small, precariously financed and inexperienced. Even among the handful of large companies, none was more than two decades old.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…while in literature, visual arts and the crafts many creative individuals were forced to compromise their standards in order to survive. The Aboriginal arts, except where they struggle to survive underground, were largely depreciated or ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The separation from political influence was seen as critical, particularly as controversy engulfed the arts after the 1973 purchase—who can forget it?—by the National Gallery of Australia of Jackson Pollock's abstract <span style="font-style:italic;">Blue Poles</span> for $1.3 million. I frequently go down to the gallery here when I have an opportunity and I often sit and ponder that particular work. I think most Australians today have great affection for the work, and of course it is probably one of the most valuable assets of the National Gallery today. That is what really set the cat amongst the pigeons. Despite the criticism of the artwork purchase at the time, in the public and the political sphere, that work has become one of the most prized possessions in the gallery's collection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that the vision of Nugget Coombs was preserved, and that there was no political interference into what the arts should be, the Australia Council Act was passed in 1975 with legislation explicitly setting out what the council's role, responsibilities and areas of concern were to be. This effectively quarantined arts funding in Australia from arbitrary executive influence. It allowed Australian culture to develop as explored through the arts and provided a means through which Australian artists could remain in Australia. In bringing the legislation to parliament, then Prime Minister Whitlam noted that the council would foster and support excellence in Australian artistic practice to 'ensure that our greatest artists remain in Australia, and that the whole Australian community is the richer for their presence.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After 40 years it has broadened its focus from traditional art forms to a broad agenda supporting artists and organisations from the singular artist to major performing arts companies. In 2010-11 the council delivered grants and project-funding of nearly $164 million in the form of almost 1,900 separate grants, enabled the creation of over 7,500 new artistic works and provided direct funding to over 900 artists and 1,000 organisations. It now offers funding across 50 separate grant categories and 40 initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2011 the then Minister for the Arts, the Hon. Simon Crean, launched the 'National cultural policy' discussion paper, and a review of the Australia Council was conducted as a review had not occurred for more than 20 years and the artistic landscape has changed dramatically. Despite the concern over the change in the artistic landscape, the first key conclusion of the review of the Australia Council, released in May 2012, found that Nugget Coombs'  original vision of the Australia Council, namely:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">to ensure the best is encouraged, and those who produce it are given the greatest opportunity to achieve the highest quality of which they are capable—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">remains relevant today. The review also supported continuing to keep the Australia Council at arm's length from government, but did note that the multifaceted purposes of the current act required clarification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of that review, the government decided to repeal the original act and substitute it with this bill we are debating the House today, but a number of previous functions of the Australia Council have been removed from the list contained within the current bill with no apparent rationale. For instance, the bill removes the function specified in the current act that the Australia Council promote the general application of the arts in the community. I think this is incredibly important. The removal is inconsistent, as I said before, with the national cultural policy with which the Council's functions are interwoven and which states the need to ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to be involved with the arts as creators and as audiences. Unfortunately, all too often people in our rural and more remote areas do tend to miss out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the bill outlines that the role of the council should be to support and promote the development of markets and audiences for the arts. This is a clear shift from community engagement and citizens as creators to a monetised approach, inconsistent with the vision of ensuring the best is encouraged, not just that which sells the most for now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also removes the current function that the Australia Council foster the expression of national identity by means of the arts meaning that the Australia Council will not have a legislative basis for supporting Australian arts and culture. The bill only outlines a fostering of excellence in Australian arts practice and the support of a diverse range of activities. Whilst excellence has always been the foundation for Australia Council, it exists also to promote an Australian identity and culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review of the Australia Council explicitly notes that before the creation of the council Australia still looked heavily toward the UK in terms of our identity generally and artistically. That was the specific reason for including supporting Australian arts and culture in the current act. Now contemporary culture has moved away from the UK and is more heavily influenced perhaps by the United States, so, even though the dominant cultural influences change, the same rationale still applies. Support is still necessary for Australian arts and culture, and the Australia Council's efforts should be focused in that direction, continuing to uphold the foundation principles of the Australia Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A related issue is that nowhere in this bill is there reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture; unfortunately, there is also no reference under the current bill as well. That is despite the fact that Nugget Coombs specifically mentions Aboriginal art as a founding reason for the council, as I outlined earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Creative Australia, the national cultural policy, has as its first goal the recognition, respect and celebration of the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. Therefore, it is only logical that a similar statement should be found within the Australia Council Act, as it will be the body that breathes life into the projects that will see the cultural policy become a reality. The fact that these critical issues are missing or have been deleted in this current bill was the subject of much debate during the inquiry held into this bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. I would commend a read of that by anyone interested in the future of the arts in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rodney Hall, the former Chairman of the Australia Council, said: 'What is it about the existing Australia Council functions that warrants deletion? It seems to me that all of them are very worthy aims.' Emeritus Professor David Williams said, 'It does seem that some of the very best of the 1975 Act has gone by the book', and a similar view was put by Ms Tamara Winikoff, representing the National Association for the Visual Arts, who also preferred the existing functions with some modest updating. Mr Rowan Ross, representing the Australia Major Performing Arts Group, told the committee that he was unaware of the reasons why the existing functions had been changed; and Ms Gabrielle Trainor, who co-chaired the review which gave rise to the legislation, told the committee that the review had not specifically recommended the removal or re-drafting of any particular functions. Why then is it that provisions that have served Australia for well over 40 years have been changed? If we are to update them, such changes should be modest, Ms Tamara Winikoff notes, and include a focus on Indigenous arts and culture rather than a dramatic re-drafting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would seem that too much focus has been placed on the review's comments that the cultural sector has become a true economic force, contributing over $30 billion towards GDP per annum, exceeding the contribution of the agriculture, forestry&amp; fishing industries. Instead, the aims of this bill should conform to the second half accompanying that statement, that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…there are wider benefits that are not as easily quantified or identified. These benefits are seen in non-arts areas of our economy such as education, social cohesion, national imagination and health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The original principles of the Australia Council should be upheld, and in my view these must be enshrined in legislation. To suggest that these issues could be dealt with in regulation is to put them under the control of the executive government of the day. The whole purpose of establishing the council under its own act was to ensure that it acted at arm's length from government—a view that was upheld by the review. Retaining the original aims of the Australia Council is critical to ensuring that Australian arts and culture have a strong foundation into the future and that we give the best support possible to Australian arts and culture in this country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  I assure everybody that has got concerns about this that I will be very quick. I want to do three things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, I want to congratulate the outgoing minister for arts for the enthusiasm which he brought to his portfolio. I think that needs to be acknowledged, and I wish to congratulate the parliamentary secretary on his elevation to this important task. I know that he shares the enthusiasm of the previous minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second aspect is that I want to take this opportunity to ask, even though we have stressed the independence of the Australia Council, that the council take on board the need to make sure that all parts of Australia have access to the arts. Some people would be bemused that I am making comment because people know that I spell arts 'yartz' and I think that a great artistic performance is Jonathan Brown running with the flight of the ball, taking the mark and then drilling a goal from outside the fifty metre arc. As I prepare for retirement and my wife and I are looking for artistic pursuits to attend, I have to often indicate to the member for Melbourne Ports that I have not sought a visa to come into his electorate because, of course, Melbourne is the epicentre of the arts. I apologise to him for encroaching upon his territory, I know that he knows that I am no threat. I thank him for the recommendation to attend the NGV Monet exhibition, which I will be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing is that—and I hope that ministers that have had previous interest in local government will understand this—I wish to congratulate the City of Whittlesea, who won the National Local Government Award for a community art project. This was a project called, importantly, 'Into the Light 2012—the unfolding story'. It was a community project that the city of Whittlesea organised in King Lake. The project aimed to use art to address the ongoing recovery issues in the region, break down isolation and build connections between the fire affected communities. I think that it was a most worthwhile project, well worthy of its recognition. I thank the House for allowing me to be so self-indulgent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="WF6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I welcome this opportunity to sum up on the Australia Council Bill 2013 and the accompanying Australia Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 in the second reading debate. This legislation is a key element of Creative Australia, the national cultural policy that has been discussed by so many speakers in this debate, including by the member for Scullin in his very kind remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In introducing this legislation the Australian government is delivering a key recommendation of the 2012 review of the Australia Council and bringing about the most significant legislative reform of the Australia Council in nearly 40 years since the great days of Nugget Coombs. At the core of the reform agenda is the introduction of a new legislative mandate for the council. In fact, 10 of the 18 recommendations of the 2012 review of the council are relevant to the council's enabling legislation to the extent that a whole new act was called for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to stress that these reforms are taking place in dialogue and in conjunction with the arts sector. The Australia Council is the nation's principal arts funding body so it is vital that the tens of thousands of people who work in our creative arts help shape and embrace the council's future directions. A sector as diverse as the arts has a range of strong and passionate views. The government—through the former Minister for the Arts, who was mentioned correctly by the member for Scullin as the honourable member for Hotham; the current Minister for the Arts, the member for Watson; and me, the parliamentary secretary—have heard the views of the creative community and we have acted. In prompting this discussion the member for Hotham set out a vision for the future of the Australian arts sector through Creative Australia, the national cultural policy. Through its $235 million package of new initiatives and reforms it has already been enthusiastically embraced by the sector, as the member for Canberra outlined in her remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia Council is fundamental to our Australian artistic identity for the reasons outlined by Nugget Coombs as quoted by the member for Pearce. The government is committed to growing the council's success and to its significant legacy. This is why the government accepted the recommendations of the review of the council, including investing an additional $75.3 million in the council over the next four years. This brings the investment in the Australia Council to over $200 million a year. This spending was confirmed in the budget. This funding will support unfunded excellence. It will support a new program of research and data collection so that the Australia Council can advocate effectively for the arts in all of its diversity. It will support innovation in our major performing arts companies, the flagships of Australian art practice. It will invest in supporting Australia's cultural leaders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, with these bills amended to take into account issues raised by stakeholders in the Senate committee, we are introducing reform of the Australia Council—reform that is necessary and overdue, reform that the sector has called for and reform that sets the council up for the next 40 years and beyond. The bills have been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. At that time my colleague the Minister for the Arts, the honourable member for Watson, welcomed the inquiry as a further opportunity to hear the sector's views. He also noted a commitment to progress the legislation at the same time he was open to the committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The House amendments developed in consultation with the Greens and the Senate committee are the result of the art sector's endeavours to ensure certain protections for artists in the day-to-day operation of the Australia Council. The member for Pearce suggested in her remarks just now that a number of principles by which the Australia Council was originally established were somehow at stake, but she did not seem to fully address the fact that these issues were addressed by the amendments and taken on as a result of the Senate committee's wishes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes, importantly, recognise and celebrate the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures to our nation's artistic identity. The member for Stirling and his distinguished colleague in the other place will be pleased that I am mentioning the function 'to uphold and promote freedom of expression in the arts'. There have been some suggestions that it was the government's intention to remove these provisions from the bill. This is simply not the case. The original bill stated that the council must take into account the rights of persons to freedom in the practice of the arts. Nevertheless, to remove any doubt about this, the amendment inserts 'freedom of expression in the arts' in the new functions of the council. It is very clear. I point that out to the members for Stirling and Pearce in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding must also be delivered in a way that reflects the diversity of the arts and promotes the engagement of the community. Both those issues raised by the member for Pearce are addressed in these amendments. The arts are no longer simply passive experiences for audiences; community members are often actively involved in the process of a project and even the performance, and art is enriched as a result. The amendment recognises this important shift. An amendment also ensures that the committees have representatives immersed in established and emerging art forms to ensure quality peer assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank everyone involved in the Senate committee for these valuable improvements to the bill. The government have listened to the views of stakeholders and to the arts community and we have heeded the committee's recommendations. The legislation put to the House in March has been updated accordingly. I can now confidently say that these bills with amendments respond to the issues raised by representatives of the tens of thousands who toil creatively in the arts sector. The framework for most of the proposed amendments is provided by the goals of Creative Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the framework for drafting of the bills in the first instance was the Australian government's response to the 2012 review of the council, the release and positive reception of Creative Australia has raised expectations in the arts sector that the goals of the policy should be reflected in the new enabling legislation for the Australia Council. Now the council's role in supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts practice is explicit in the functions of the council. This reflects the first goal of Creative Australia to 'recognise, respect and celebrate the centrality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures to the uniqueness of Australian identity'. New functions are included that recognise the importance of diversity and the role of communities in shaping Australia's cultural identity. The very issues that the member for Pearce raised are addressed by these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia Council is specifically empowered to support Australian arts practice that both reflects the diversity of Australia and promotes community participation in the arts. This is consistent with the second goal of Creative Australia—that government support the arts must reflect the diversity of Australia and that all citizens, regardless of their background or circumstances, have a right to shape our cultural identity and its expression. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of a function from the original Australia Council Act 1975 has been retained to ensure that the upholding and promoting of freedom of expression in the arts remains core business for the Australia Council. That was included in the initial bill as a matter that must be taken into account by the council in the performance of its functions. But in response to stakeholder feedback and the Senate inquiry, we are including it in a function of the amended bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the bill's introduction the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Minister for the Arts noted that, since its inception the Australia Council supported Australian artists and organisations with two guiding principles: the pursuit of artistic excellence based on peer assessment—the very issue that comes from the vision of Nugget Coombs addressed by the member for Pearce in her queries about this bill, so there are consistencies there; and that funding decisions be made at arms-length from government. The government's commitment to these principles has not changed and will not change. Indeed, this legislation strengthens these principles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final amendment to be moved by the government is the firming up of peer assessment principles. Under this amendment, should a committee be established by the governing board of the council to advise or make recommendations about policy or the provision of financial assistance in relation to any of the arts, the membership of the committee must include at least one person with relevant experience in the arts. This is being included to provide assurances to the sector that the longstanding principle of peer assessment of funding decisions is enshrined in legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments further strengthen provisions contained in the first draft of the bill and make explicit other provisions. The bill delivers on the Australian government's response to the review of the Australia Council and is consistent with the goals of the Australian government's 10-year plan for the arts set out in the vision framed by the previous Minister for the Arts, Creative Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia Council (Consequential Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 is a companion bill and contains consequential amendments and transitional arrangements related to the proposed reform of the Australia Council. In the main, the bill repeals the Australia Council Act 1975 and provides for the business continuity for the Australia Council, including its staff. It will ensure that the transition to the new operational arrangements are seamless—indeed, serendipitous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring that the continuity of key governance roles during the organisation's transition to new operating environment will be important for the broader reform agenda of Creative Australia to be implemented. Accordingly, provisions are included which allow for the appointments of the current chair and deputy chair to be carried over into the new operating environment. For similar reasons, transitional provisions will also apply to the office of the CEO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together these bills will bring the Australia Council into line with other modern statutory authorities and into the 21st century. I thank the member for Watson for his support in steering this, my first bill, through the House. I thank members for their contributions to this debate and support for this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  The Greens support the amendments that are being moved. Many of these amendments come out of discussions that our leader, Christine Milne, and also our spokesperson for the arts has had with the government, and that has been reflected in the parliamentary secretary's statement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Scullin mentioned little while ago that sometimes he feels like you need a visa to cross the river to go south in Melbourne to visit some of the extraordinary galleries and the like that exist there. I know the feeling sometimes that there can be an impenetrable divide to cross south of the river in Melbourne, but I can say to the member for Scullin and to all others that we have very porous borders on the north of the river, and you can always come into the electorate of Melbourne any time you feel! Because, not only do we have a number of what might be considered to be orthodox expressions of the arts—very excellent galleries, performance companies and theatres—but what there also is in Melbourne, and this goes to the reason for the amendments, is a large number of people who work very much at the grassroots and the community level, especially in areas like Indigenous arts, doing things that really contribute to the culture of this country and contribute to what we would all call creativity in the arts, but who for many years have found it hard to knock on the doors of the Australia Council and of other funding bodies and have their activities recognised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the leadership of many people, including those in Melbourne, and the artistic practices that they support that have led in part to this bill and to these amendments, and I congratulate the government for proceeding with this bill. For example, we have had the Next Wave Festival and people like the former director of that, Mr Marcus Westbury, who for many years have argued for reform in this areas—reform to the funding systems to enable the funding that comes, including from this place, to better reflect what is actually happening in the artistic community. The amendments that we have secured will reflect and strengthen that. I support the amendments and I commend the amendments and the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRADBURY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  Firstly, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of those members who have contributed to this debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013 amends the income tax law to protect the integrity of Australia's income tax system and to secure a fair, competitive and sustainable tax base for the future of the nation. These reforms come forward at a time of unprecedented global recognition that base erosion and profit shifting must be addressed. The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors have acknowledged the importance of addressing base erosion and are working on a comprehensive plan to address base erosion and profit shifting. Similarly, this government is committed to taking steps where necessary to ensure the integrity and the sustainability of the tax system. These amendments demonstrate that commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 amends part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Part IVA is the income tax law's general anti-avoidance rule. Its proper operation is vital to protect the integrity of the income tax law, which is still overwhelmingly the single largest source of Commonwealth revenue. The principal role of part IVA is to counter arrangements that, when objectively viewed, are carried out with the sole or dominant purpose of securing a tax advantage. Broadly speaking, part IVA does this by exposing the substance or reality of the arrangements to the ordinary operation of the tax law. The proper role for the tax benefit test is to compare the tax consequences of what the taxpayer actually did with the tax consequences of a reasonable alternative that achieves substantively the same thing. It makes little sense in an anti-avoidance provision to allow the tax consequences of what the taxpayer has achieved to act as a shield against the operation of part IVA. In particular, taxpayers should not be able to avoid the normal tax consequences of what they have actually done by arguing that they would have done something completely different or, in fact, that they would have done nothing at all. These amendments ensure that part IVA remains effective in countering tax avoidance schemes. An effective general anti-avoidance rule ensures that the burden left by those who avoid their tax obligations does not unduly fall on those who are already contributing their fair share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has consulted widely in developing amendments to correct the problems that came to light. Those consultations involved experts from academia, senior members of the legal profession and experienced tax practitioners. In addition, the draft amendments were released for public comment in November and December last year. Accordingly, the government is confident that this bill appropriately addresses the problems, protecting the integrity of the income tax law, and that it does so with no unnecessary interference with Australia's normal commercial activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill modernises Australia's transfer pricing rules in accordance with the government's announcement in November 2011. It provides a new and comprehensive transfer pricing regime that is aligned with internationally accepted principles. Cross-border related-party trade was valued at about $270 billion in 2009. That is approximately half of Australia's total annual trade flows and equivalent to about 20 per cent of our gross domestic product. Properly functioning transfer pricing rules are therefore critical to maintaining a healthy tax system so that the government can continue to deliver the public goods and services that Australians expect and require, like world-class health and education systems, a strong social safety net and public infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when the need for global cooperation to address transfer pricing has never been greater, these amendments align Australia's transfer pricing rules with the international best practice as set out by the OECD, as well as with the transfer pricing rules contained in Australia's tax treaties. Alignment with the international norms will improve integrity and efficiency as well as reduce compliance costs and uncertainty for taxpayers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides a clear legal pathway to the use of the OECD guidance material in interpreting the rules, avoiding the need to get costly expert advice on whether such guidance may be used. The bill provides an efficient mechanism to update the relevant guidance material if and when international principles evolve. This ensures that Australia's rules can stay at the global forefront in the fight against profit shifting while maintaining appropriate parliamentary oversight. The new rules operate on a self-assessment basis which brings Australia's transfer pricing rules into line with the overall design of Australia's tax system. The previously unlimited time that the Commissioner of Taxation had to make a transfer pricing adjustment has now been reduced to seven years, striking an appropriate balance between providing taxpayers with certainty as to their tax affairs and providing the commissioner with the time required to conduct an audit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also links documentation with access to a reduction in administrative penalties. This approach allows taxpayers to risk-assess matters that could be the subject of administrative penalties and to prepare documentation accordingly. The proposed record keeping rules, including the nature of the documentation, are consistent with the commissioner's current approach and should be familiar to taxpayers. The government has engaged extensively with industry, corporate and community representatives. The important contributions of each of these groups have greatly assisted the design of these rules. I would like to thank them for their efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition have said that they will vote against this bill. I would like to take the opportunity to respond to a number of the comments that have been made in this debate, in particular by the member for North Sydney and the member for Dunkley. I make the observation that, whilst it does appear that those opposite are determined to vote against every single tax avoidance measure that this government brings into the parliament, collectively and cumulatively they now account for revenue protection measures that are greater than $10 billion. That is the revenue that has been protected or is a subject of measures to protect revenue under this bill and other bills that have come before it. Every time we have sought to close down these loopholes, we have had opposition and interference being run by the coalition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the Australian people have to ask the question: why is it that every time there is a rort, a rip-off or a loophole, the coalition are in there to protect it? It is about time they joined with the government and took action to close down these loopholes and to make sure that the honest, fair, hardworking Australians and businesses that are out there paying their fair share do not get lumbered with an additional tax burden because others are shifting profits and eroding our tax base in the exercise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have suggested that there has been a lack of proper process in the way in which this bill has found its way into this place for debate. They pointed to the fact that no hearing was conducted by the House economics committee. But what they did not point out—and I think it might have been the member for Throsby who pointed this out in the debate—was that the only reason there was no hearing on this bill was because the coalition members of that committee were not prepared to turn up for a hearing. They could not be bothered to turn up for a hearing, so the government members of the committee decided there was no point in going ahead with the hearing because they were satisfied with the merits of the bill. On that basis no hearing was conducted. When it came into this place for debate, the member for North Sydney said, 'Well, this is such an important matter that it should have been the subject of a parliamentary hearing and in the absence of that hearing we cannot support it.' It sounds like a convenient excuse for a party determined to side with those that are seeking to shift profits and minimise their tax obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even subsequent to the member for North Sydney and member for Dunkley's contribution, this bill went off to a Senate committee, and it has been considered by the Senate economics committee. In the course of those considerations, given it was such an important, complex and technical bill and one that required the scrutiny of the opposition, I find it a little puzzling that only one member of the coalition turned up to those hearings: Senator Bushby—credit to him, a lack of credit to his colleagues. I think the lack of commitment to scrutinising these matters in hearing processes is further evidence that those opposite had already made up their minds on this bill before it came into the place. They point to questions of consultation and say there has not been sufficient consultation in relation to these measures. What a load of rubbish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transfer pricing reforms were announced in November—not November 2012 but November 2011. They have been the subject of consultation, discussion and round tables since the end of 2011. In relation to the Part IVA amendments, the announcement was made by the former Assistant Treasurer over a year ago in March 2012. So these matters have been the subject of discussion and consultation for well over a year. In relation to the Part IVA changes, in response to concerns by stakeholders, I established a special process of consultation, a process that involved a formal round table, drawing on experts from the academic area, tax practitioners in the field and also various peak body representatives of behalf of corporate taxpayers and others. We worked through a systematic process. We then had the amendments that were proposed reviewed by senior members of the bar, senior counsel. As a consequence of that we then released an exposure draft, as indeed we did for the transfer pricing reforms. We released exposure drafts in both cases. I thank those that contributed to the consultation process because the final form of this bill, of these measures, has greatly been improved as a result of those contributions. But never let it be said by those opposite that there has been no consultation. There has been considerable consultation, and the process has benefited from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly on the substance of what is at stake here, cracking down on loopholes that are being the subject of aggressive tax minimisation strategies by multinationals to shift profits offshore, to load up debt into Australia and to seek to avoid their tax obligations is a matter that this government takes very seriously. We will chase those companies down every burrow of the tax laws to make sure that they do not get a free ride on the contributions of hard-working Australians, families, small businesses and other businesses that are paying their fair share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Dunkley and the member for North Sydney may not want to confront that fact. They may not believe that it is important, but I should say that there is at least one person on the other side that believes this is important, and that is the member for Wentworth. When a previous bill in relation to transfer pricing matters came before the parliament, the member for Wentworth stood up to be counted. He did not have his vote counted to support the proposition, but he did stand up and at least voice support for the government's agenda when it comes to tackling transfer pricing, profit shifting and base erosion activity. Speaking on a bill, the member for Wentworth previously said, 'We have to take this issue seriously because there is a tendency to ignore these issues until it is too late.' He went on to say that we cannot 'put the taxation of international transactions into the too-hard basket.' Full credit to him for supporting the agenda that this government has been pursuing in relation to the base erosion and profit shifting agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the House that in the budget announced by the Treasurer this week there is a wide ranging and comprehensive package—$4.2 billion worth of revenue measures—to protect the corporate tax base and to crack down on loopholes. It is a series of measures that show the international community that here in Australia we are to be taken seriously. We will do what is necessary with our laws to protect our revenue base and to set a clear example to those nations around the world that may be considering opting for various preferential regimes that undermine the efforts of global cooperation towards reducing base erosion. We are serious, we are cleaning up our act and we are making sure that we are cracking down on any loophole here in Australia, and we expect others to do the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />One of the more peculiar contributions in this debate came from the member for North Sydney. For all of his huff and puff, he seems to be just a little confused about the measures that are contained in the bill. I note in particular that he took great delight in quoting from a speech that Justice Pagone of the Supreme Court of Victoria made. He used that speech to argue that business has to model every alternative use and every alternative tax scenario before it actually goes down a particular path. He was suggesting that Justice Pagone's comments were in relation to our measures. The only point that he did not advise the House of is that Justice Pagone gave his speech before our exposure draft had been released. Justice Pagone was not talking in relation to the measures that we are proposing; he was speaking of the operation of part IVA as it currently exists. We are seeking to change that, and the changes that are made by this bill to part IVA are, in fact, in part designed to address this problem by limiting the comparison of alternative postulates to other ways of achieving what the taxpayer did in fact achieve.

                    </a>  I present a copy of this statement, which the committee has endorsed. The two Australia Council bills were referred for consideration to this House by the Selection Committee of the House on 21 March after this committee's meeting during the previous sitting period. The committee met today to consider how to proceed. Members noted that the provisions of the bill had been referred to the Senate Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and the Transport Legislation Committee with the same reasons given—that is, 'to determine the impact of the provisions contained in the bill on the Australia Council and on Australian arts and cultural organisations'. The Senate committee was asked to report by 9 May and we note that the report was presented to the Senate on that date. According to the Senate report, the inquiry was advertised, 28 submissions were received and a public hearing was held. Following the Senate committee's deliberations, comments were received from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. These were noted and included in an appendix to the Senate committee report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate committee report canvasses the views it received from a variety of sources and makes three recommendations, including that the bills be passed with amendments proposed by the committee. This House committee has noted on several occasions during this parliament that where legislation has been referred to committees of both places there is little to be gained from the conduct of concurrent inquiries. The House committee, noting that the Senate has completed a report in a short time frame in which public input was sought and recommendations made, does not propose to conduct an additional inquiry, especially not where the reasons for the inquiry are identical. To that end, no recommendation is made, and the committee considers that its task is concluded.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="EM6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr STONE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  As I was saying in my earlier remarks before the debate was interrupted: you can imagine that the economies of scale are such that just a few vacancies—perhaps only three or four over several weeks—can make a significant difference to the viability of a small rural or regional aged-care facility that may only have some 40 or 50 beds. Then there is the issue of the burden of the red tape—a crippling lot of regulations, often simply for the sake of regulation, it seems. The sector is stymied by requirements to document and double-document, often requiring the hiring of expensive consultants. Everyone agrees that the sector needs appropriate and tight quality control. We are all horrified when we see in the media cases of the most frail and vulnerable taken advantage of in an aged-care facility. However, that is a very rare occurrence, and most facilities do their utmost to make sure they have an excellent standard of service and safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The burden of red tape should not be such that one-size-fits-all is the standard. If you have a facility of 500 or so beds in a metropolitan area, your capacity to constantly send back forms and be oversighted is quite different to when you have a 50-bed facility located on the banks of the Campaspe River. I agree that the requirement for the same quality of care needs to be there, but the capacity for those two different facilities to employ special administrative staff or consultants is quite different. The endless compliance requirements are often replicated, and it kills the passion for the work for many of the aged-care nurses, who are there to support their residents, not to endlessly fill in duplicated and meaningless forms. Given that aged-care nurses earn 20 to 30 per cent less than their acute-care colleagues, this adds mightily to their frustration with their workplace. No wonder the aged-care workforce is ageing and that it is often difficult to attract a new generation of aged-care workers, particularly when there is an acute shortage of division 1 nurses in the nearby hospital. We need the very best quality of care in these facilities. We need men as well as women working in these places, as there are more men coming into aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Numbers of aged-care facilities in my electorate have made the point that we can go too far in keeping people supported in their homes if it means that when they finally come in to residences they have already had a significant compromise in their own health. Of course we support ageing in place. In the Howard government days we significantly advanced the opportunities for older people to remain at home for as long as possible, but it does come to a stage where it is not sensible to provide a whole range of very expensive services to people in their own homes when they are beyond being able to be independent in their own places. We need to watch that we do not swing the pendulum too far in the other direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the Living Longer Living Better package of five bills does not resolve many outstanding viability issues for providers, particularly in rural and regional Australia where the size of the facilities is typically much smaller than those you find in metropolitan areas. The $1.6 billion cut from the aged-care funding instrument, ACFI, under these reforms has placed even more pressure on the sector, and many now fear they are going to the wall. These five bills only cherry pick a few recommendations of the Productivity Commission report <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians</span>, which was delivered in 2011. The five bills add to regulation for an already overburdened and highly regulated sector. The five bills establish the framework for the workforce supplement, which has created uncertainty and will be potentially costly for providers. This relies on cuts to ACFI and appears to be a political mechanism to unionise the sector rather than a sensible activity which will make sure that you have a proper matching of the workforce with the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The five bills are typical of this government's practice of enacting framework legislation and leaving the bulk of the detail to delegated legislation. This is asking us to buy a pig in a poke. It is putting off the hard work until a little later, or is it a case of trying to keep more of the bad news out of the House and therefore genuine debate? We are very suspicious that there is not enough detail in this legislation. It should not be a mere framework; it should give us a great deal of detail, so we can understand whether it serves our ageing population well into the future. We do not know the full impact of these bills yet, and that is a serious problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I end where I began, by saying that care of our aged, our frail elderly, our most vulnerable, is one of the most important things a civil society can do. Australia needs to be proud of the quality of its aged-care sector. I commend the member for Mackellar, who, when she was Minister for Seniors, did extraordinarily good work in making sure that the quality and standards of Australian aged care were world's best. But you can overburden the sector with costs and you can underfund the sector. You can overburden the sector with regulation, and all you do is cripple the sector which is so important to the future of older Australians. We are an ageing population. We have a significant number of concerns about proper care of and the best place for those with dementia or Alzheimer's conditions. At the moment in rural and regional Australia we have a significant skilled workforce issue and have difficulty in finding division 1 nurses who need to be in this sector. I am concerned about this set of bills. I think that a lot of the sector is waiting for a change of government to put all of this right. Let's hope a change of government comes soon enough.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="83N" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  I rise to strongly support the Living Longer Living Better package of bills that we are debating today. These bills will give effect to the much needed aged-care reform. In saying that, I do not doubt that members on both sides of this House are committed to seeing that older Australians get the best possible care and the best possible services which will empower them to be active and live independently as long as they can. I believe that we need reform and this reform will transform aged care in Australia and replace an out-dated system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current system has a lot of bureaucratic requirements that stifle people providing services. It is a system that has failed older Australians. Not only has it failed older Australians but it has also failed their carers, aged-care providers and workers in the industry. It is time for a change. We need to make it better for everybody involved with aged care, whether they be a person who benefits from aged care or one who is a provider, a worker or a carer. This is very important legislation that will benefit hundreds of thousands of Australians. I urge the opposition to open their minds to the fact that we need change, so that we can have a truly person centred aged-care system and provision of aged care and aged-care services that older Australians need. I do not like the word 'system' because that sounds like institutionalisation. Aged care is about providing care and access to services that older Australians deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find this is particularly important in my electorate. Shortland is an electorate with one of the oldest populations in the country. Older residents of Shortland talk to me regularly about aged-care services and the need for a change. When a family or an older person is in a crisis you have to react very quickly to try and resolve the problem. The legislation we have before us will provide a vehicle for taking a better planned approach to delivering services to older Australians. The current system is obsolete and it is not person focused. It is a system that has passed its use-by date, unlike the legislation that we have before us today, which will deliver person-focused aged care where the person, the family, the carers and the providers are given the information that they need to make an informed decision. I think it is very important that we empower older Australians and not take away from them the power to determine where they would like their life to go and also to involve the family and all those that are important to those older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is legislation that has been developed after wide and extensive consultation. First we had the Productivity Commission report and consultation with the National Aged Care Alliance, and the minister had a national conversation on ageing. Then experts and stakeholder groups were consulted. A detailed paper was put out, and then there was ongoing consultation. This package was not announced just before it was introduced into this parliament; it was announced in April 2012. So there has been a lot of consultation and discussion about this piece of legislation, and I would have to say that within my electorate it has been really well received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a $3.7 billion package over a five-year period. It encompasses a 10-year reform program to create a flexible and seamless system that provides older Australians with more choice and control and easier access to a full range of services where they want it and when they need it. It is seamless, so an older person is not fronting up and being assessed for one thing and then having to go back and be assessed for another thing. It is about being able to access those services without having to go through the barriers and the blocks that are in place at the moment. Older Australians tell me all the time that those barriers and blocks are a problem and something that they would like to see changed, and they are something that this legislation will change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package also positions the aged-care system to meet the social and economic challenges of the nation's ageing population. It is delivering better residential aged care; additional support and care to help older Australians to remain living in their home; and additional help for carers to access respite and other support. It is strengthening the aged-care workforce, supporting consumers and research, providing better health connections and tackling the nation's dementia epidemic—and I would just like to say that the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, which I chair, will be delivering a report on dementia in the very near future. As I have spoken with stakeholders, carers and people that are living with dementia, I have learnt a lot about dementia and the fact that, as a nation, we really need to take it very seriously and address issues surrounding it. That is what this government has done: it has recognised the need for us to put in place a strategy for dealing with dementia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is also about supporting older Australians from diverse backgrounds and building an aged-care system for the future. Everything has its time and its place. We need change, and when we have change it should be developed through extensive consultation and in an inclusive way involving all those people that have an interest. The government's aged-care package was substantially informed by the Productivity Commission inquiry into caring for older Australians. There was extensive consultation, as I have already mentioned. The reforms will be implemented in stages, which gives us time to adjust to change. These reforms will ensure that Australia's aged-care system is underpinned by fairer and more sustainable financial arrangements. That is very important, because if you have a system that is unsustainable then those people that need to rely on that system will be hurt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reform of Australia's aged-care system is essential if we are to provide our nation's seniors with the care, the security and, above all, the dignity that they deserve. This package will make it easier for older Australians to stay in their homes. We are increasing the home care packages from almost $60,000 to $100,000 and providing tailored care packages for people receiving home care and new funding for dementia care. There are caps to the costs so that full pensioners will pay no more than the basic fees. We will be providing more choice about how people wish to pay for their care. Instead of a bond, which can cost up to $2.6 million and bears no resemblance to the actual cost of accommodation, you will be able to pay through a lump sum or a periodic payment. That, once again, provides flexibility. It is about looking to the needs of the person. It gives families and older Australians time to make a decision about how to pay by introducing a cooling-off period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the very first time, we will introduce fairness into the payment system. Right now, pensioners often pay more than people with hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets. This legislation will change that. From now on, the system will be fairer. It will be based on capacity to pay, and the amount you pay for aged-care services will be capped and underpinned by tightening means tests, meaning that older Australians will not be forced into a fire sale of their home. If there is any one issue that I think older Australians are concerned about it is the fact that they will be forced to sell their home. Their home is their castle. It is where their children grew up and it is their connection to their life. Even if they need to live in residential aged care, they all want not to be forced to sell their home. It is very important for older Australians, and the government has recognised this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be increased funding for aged-care workers, and there is also going to be an increased number of residential aged-care places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is very important, because, as we have more people becoming older, we are going to need not only more packages but also more residential beds in aged-care facilities, and they need to be quality beds. I acknowledge the role that the member for Mackellar played in improving quality in aged-care facilities. It is very important that we can rely upon the fact that we have quality aged-care facilities. This legislation takes it another step. It will be providing more funding for dementia care and aged care and support for services. It will establish a single gateway to all aged-care services and stricter standards. This legislation has the scope to change the face of aged care and aged-care services, not only for the people providing the services but, most importantly, for the people who are using those services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July, there will be a new type of care: home care. Home care will replace community care and some of the other forms of flexible care. There will be four levels of home-care packages covering basic home care all the way through to complex home care. There is an additional dementia supplement and a new veterans' supplement payout to provide for people who care for those living with dementia or people who are veterans. The existing community visitors scheme for people receiving residential care will be extended also to those people who are receiving home care. This will look at addressing the fact that many people who are older are quite often restricted in their ability to get out and about. This is designed to reduce isolation and to keep all our older Australians connected to their community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From July 2014 there will be changes to the way home-care subsidies and fees are calculated for care recipients. Some people who are receiving care will need to contribute to their costs through income tests. People who receive home care on 30 June 2014 will continue under their current arrangements. People entering the system will come under the new arrangements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have available I cannot touch on all aspects of this legislation. It is extensive. It will change the face of aged care and aged-care services within this country. In a society that is ageing you need to have an aged-care system that is fair, equitable and accessible to all. Any aged-care system needs to provide certainty and be designed to meet the needs of older Australians. It needs to be seamless and it needs to be a system that also looks after aged-care providers and workers, because they are pivotal in the provision of a quality aged-care system. The legislation we have before us today does that and should be supported by both sides of this House. </span>

I also acknowledge, as the member for Shortland did, the member for Mackellar, who was an aged-care minister in the John Howard government. She did an excellent job and was acknowledged by the other side of the House. I have recently had the member for Mackellar, who is now the shadow minister for seniors, in my constituency. We were certainly welcomed very warmly out there and we certainly saw some of the aged-care challenges that we have in rural communities for what is across Australia an ageing population. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 is a package of five bills and does not resolve many of the outstanding viability issues for providers, and I want to touch on a few of those particularly in rural communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this most critical time, as a result of the unprecedented demographic change occurring in Australia, investment in the aged-care sector is imperative. Communities across my electorate want to have an aged-care facility where they can look after their seniors as they grow older and need more care and have to leave home for that care. It becomes a pride of their community. It also keeps their communities together. Because, without that aged-care facility, people have to leave their homes, their communities and their extended families and go to where there is an aged-care facility that can accommodate them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This original reform package was announced by the government in April of last year, over 12 months ago. Yet it has taken the government a year to bring legislation to this parliament so that the opposition can look at it and see what we can do in relation to this aged-care reform. Now it wants to ram these bills through the House without proper consideration. They have had over 12 months to deal with the reform and yet here we are with just four weeks to run in this House before the House is prorogued and the election is called to deal with one of the most critical issues that this nation has to address—that is: how are we going to fund and support our seniors and people who require aged-care services? </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the failings in the aged-care reform package that this government is missing is the failure to reduce red tape. This is something that the sector has been urgently requesting from government; to eliminate red tape. The sector is already wallowing in red tape. This package will actually heap more red tape on them, and more bureaucrats to deal with it </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the reviews, inquiries and talkfests, the government has ignored the bulk of the Productivity Commission's report by cherry picking just a few of its recommendations—not all of the recommendations, just a few. This is not real reform. This is another Labor Party smoke-and-mirrors trick.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the member for Mackellar and many on this side of the House—and, I am sure, many on the other side of the House—have had aged-care providers come to them and identify some of the problems that this government has not addressed. And yet what the government is proposing will create more red tape and cost these providers more to deal with the regulation and meet accreditation guidelines and laws. A key issue that has caused major concern with the stakeholders is the decision by this government to rip $1.6 billion out of the ACFI. I guess it is in response to the way the government has mismanaged the economy and mismanaged its budget—so it looks for savings and is going to rip $1.6 billion out of this sector, a vital sector in the Australian community. Another issue is the $1.2 billion workforce supplement. It seems to me and many on this side of the House that the workforce supplement is about the unions, who really at the end of the day are the Labor Party bosses. That $1.2 billion workforce supplement is offered to the sector, but with conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is facing a major challenge with the median age of Australians growing all the time. In fact, in my electorate and in many rural communities it is rapidly increasing, more so than in many of our cities and larger regional centres. In my own electorate the median age is 38.2 years, which is 1.2 years above the national average. The Winton and Barcoo shires in my electorate have recently had some work done by the library to identify some of the issues of demographic change in my electorate. They found that the median age in those two communities is 43 years. In South Burnett, which the member for Mackellar, the shadow minister for seniors, visited with me recently—Kingaroy is the major centre there—the median family age is 42 years, as against the national average of 37 years. Australians are living longer, and that is the challenge. That is why this package of measures is so disappointing, with an opportunity lost to address some of the key concerns of the major stakeholders, the charitable organisations that provide the services and run very successful aged-care facilities. The government just has not listened to the message that is coming from our aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said a moment ago, a few weeks ago I visited Goondiwindi with the member for Mackellar. We visited the Kaloma Home for the Aged at Goondiwindi. It is privately owned and run by the community, and it is the pride and joy of the community. Over many years they have built on from the reforms that were introduced by the member for Mackellar when the coalition was in government, which were acknowledged while we were there. It is a magnificent facility. But they tell me this new package of measures in this bill is causing them major concerns and cost blowouts. An issue they raised with me was their significant concern with regard to the workforce supplement. They will miss out on the accommodation supplement despite having completed significant building developments and upgrades supported by the residential ratios. A number of the substantive concepts relevant to accommodation payments in the Living Longer Living Better reform package are contrary to the market driven model proposed by the Productivity Commission and, as Kaloma says, without significant amendment will deter future investment in this sector. That is the very opposite of what we should be aiming to achieve: to encourage more development of aged-care facilities. Because the government has not picked up on the recommendations of the Productivity Commission this package will deter future investment in this sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions that introduce controls for setting accommodation payments should be removed and replaced with a market-driven model where the providers set a price, as proposed by the Productivity Commission. The board of management of the Kaloma Home for the Aged at Goondiwindi support that. That is what they would like to see. The government's aged-care reforms require that accommodation supplements will be reduced by 25 per cent where facilities have fewer than 40 per cent financially disadvantaged people in occupancy. So what they are saying is supplements will be reduced by 25 per cent if they do not have 40 per cent of financially disadvantaged people in occupancy. In a sector that is dominated by religious and charitable organisations, the government really does need to only provide a reasonable accommodation supplement to promote investment that goes to support the financially disadvantaged who, when they do need an aged care facility, are going to be looking to the charitable organisations who run these facilities to support their needs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I have found in many parts of my electorate is multipurpose health services. These are an excellent response. They are funded by the Commonwealth, and I acknowledge that, where the multipurpose health service is attached to the local hospital. But what it also identifies is that it enables communities that have a hospital, after consultation with the community, to provide some aged-care beds, particularly high-level care, for those communities where otherwise those people would have to leave that community. It is an excellent way to provide that very much needed service to those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a number of them. I have been to a number of the consultative meetings. Only last week I was down at Surat, south of my home town of Roma, with the Queensland Minister for Health, Lawrence Springborg, opening the new multipurpose health service in Surat. It is a wonderful facility, purpose-built, added on to the hospital and one of the facilities there that enables the community to stay together rather than those people leaving Surat. It certainly supports families and extended families. I think there are six beds there, but it is not like a hospital environment; it is more like a home. It is a wonderful facility and I congratulate the design engineers and the Commonwealth for that matter, who have provided the funding which will be administered and run by Queensland Health because it is a Queensland Health hospital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other one, which is under construction at the moment, is at Injune. It underpins what I have been saying about providing services to our smaller rural communities. There is a hospital there and they had an aged-care facility: Mount Hutton. It was about 10 rooms and it was run by the Churches of Christ. But what they were finding with all the regulations they have is that basically it was becoming unviable, and they wanted to hand it back to the community. The community were unable to run it; it does require the knowledge of charitable organisations that have been running—and do successfully run—many in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We went through a very difficult period, because it looked like there would be no aged-care facility in the town of Injune. It would shut: a wonderful facility, built by the community with money saved by the community. That is what underpinned a lot of our aged-care facilities in the past in many of our communities. It was money raised by the local community to build the aged-care facilities that look after the people as they aged in their towns. They recognise, as I do, that it is so important to keep families together in these smaller communities. Otherwise, it sees the deterioration of help for many and the dislocation of family life, if you are not able to keep communities together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Luckily, we have been able to negotiate, through Queensland Health and the Commonwealth government, a facility where we could expand the hospital to include a multipurpose health service. This is now under construction. I am certainly looking forward to when it is completed and to attending the opening there, because I know what it means to the community of Injune and the surrounding district. I know it will be of the standard that we opened recently in Surat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly in Mitchell, just west of my home town, we are going to establish, through the Commonwealth funding as well as with Queensland Health, a multipurpose health service attached to the hospital. When they are attached to the hospital it means that the laundry, the cooking and the registered nurses are there and available all the time, 24 hours, seven days a week, to meet the needs of those who are residents in the aged-care section of the mulitpurpose health service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very disappointed that this government has failed to pick up completely the recommendation from the Productivity Commission. The aged-care providers that I talk to are still very concerned that this is going to add more costs, more red tape and will make it even more challenging to keep many of these operations in rural communities viable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013, the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013 and associated bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ageing of our population is the biggest social issue facing Australia. We are a rapidly ageing population, acquiring more complex health conditions with changing disease patterns. This social issue is, of course, also a budget issue; an ageing population means fewer people will be generating taxation revenue. The dependency ratio in 2007 was six people of working age for every person aged over 67. By 2047, this will be almost halved to approximately 3.2 people of working age for each person aged over 67. By 2050, over 3½ million Australians are expected to use aged-care services each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With greater numbers using aged-care services, there will be greater demands on those services. There will be increased numbers of Australians with dementia requiring these services and the average age of a home-care recipient, which currently stands at 82-years of age, will continue to increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we move from the baby-boomer generation to the next, users of aged-care services will no longer meekly accept what they are given, as many learned to do during the tough economic times of the last century. It is therefore integral to the future care of older Australians that we implement policies which give clients and their families the ability to choose their own provider to deliver government-funded services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This highlights the fundamental importance of implementing real reform in the aged-care sector. However, the five bills today continue the piecemeal approach from this government rather than a genuine attempt at reforming the sector. They are a response from the Labor government, announced in April 2012, to the Productivity Commission's August 2011, <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians </span>report. In many ways, these long-awaited changes are simply too little too late from a government that has ignored the aged-care sector since being elected in 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have undertaken a litany of reports and reviews—20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports in total—and have then chosen to ignore the outcomes of these processes, instead, responding with more inquiries without making any real decisions to secure the future of the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, today's measures do not embrace the opportunity for real reform. This Labor government has cherry picked a few recommendations from the Productivity Commission report. Industry sources estimate that about five to eight per cent of its recommendations have actually been adopted from the Productivity Commission's extensive and comprehensive report, which initially received more than 500 submissions with a further 500-plus following the release of the draft report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After five years of neglect, our aged-care system needs urgent change to provide viable and effective services for older Australians. Instead, year after year, this government has committed itself to taking money out of the aged-care sector. Last year, Labor cut $1.6 billion from the aged-care funding instrument to fund a $1.2 billion workforce compact. The ACFI is the means by which Commonwealth subsidies are allocated to residential aged-care providers. The government justified this by publicly suggesting there was widespread rorting by aged-care providers, although I note there has not been a single prosecution in five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it often does, whether it is 457 skilled migration visas or our national sporting codes, this government makes public allegations that taint an entire sector without providing any evidence for their claims. Furthermore, according to the Grant Thornton report released in June 2012, after the Labor government announced the Living Longer Living Better package, more than $3½ billion in planned aged-care development projects have been shelved. The organisation Leading Age Services Australia also revealed in August 2012 that their industry faces a blackhole of more than $750 million over the next 2½ years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged and Community Services Australia have also reported on the dire situation of the sector. In their 2011-12 budget submission, they reported:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A snapshot of the industry does not depict a sustainable system: that only 40% of aged care providers are operating in the black: hours of service are decreasing; hours of care provided under community aged care packages have fallen; and many providers are not building new residential care beds. The situation is worse in rural and regional areas where providers face higher costs with less ability to manage their income streams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the evidence on the ground. The aged sector industry is suffering. As a result of this Labor government's decisions to cut funding to the sector, providers are facing a huge task in even remaining viable, which will, in turn, have huge impacts on Australians who need their services as well as those employed in the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When speaking to aged-care providers in my electorate, they have told me that they do not disagree with the general direction of the key points of the package, but they want further detail. They are waiting on the detail about what the impact of the regulations placed on providers and consumers will mean for aged-care services. One of the most important areas on which this parliament must focus is implementing real reform to improve customer directed care. This means providing real change. The ability to decide who delivers services should be placed squarely in the hands of the consumer without the very onerous red tape and caveats that currently exist in the sector, not to mention the micromanagement of providers by the Department of Health and Ageing. If we are not able to get this right, if we are not able to genuinely improve this sector, then we undermine the entire philosophy of consumer directed care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Users of aged-care services must be provided with all the relevant information about what services would be appropriate for them, and not just advising which aged-care organisation has been approved through the government's tendering process. This means moving away from the Canberra based bureaucratic tendering nightmare, which by its very nature will favour those already well embedded within the system. There are a lot of details to cover in these bills, which is why they were referred to the Senate community affairs committee. The committee was due to deliver its final report on 17 June 2013, but has recently ceded to the demands of the government that the parliament consider these bills without full knowledge of their ramifications and will report instead on 31 May—a change the coalition senators strongly oppose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that, without following the appropriate parliamentary processes, all stakeholders in the industry will not have the opportunity to make meaningful submissions on the detail of the bills and their instruments. As Leading Age Services Australia has indicated, they believe that, considering the level of detail and complexity contained in the instruments, it is essential that proper parliamentary processes be adopted. Furthermore, the opportunity to comment on the consultation draft documents for the Home Care Packages Program guidelines has not yet closed, and I expect that providers will have a great deal to say on the direction of those draft guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the actual details of the bills mean more bureaucracy and more regulation in what is already a highly regulated sector. The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2012 implements changes in four key areas, including: changes to residential care; changes to establish a new type of care—home care; changes relating to governance and administration; and further minor administrative or consequential changes. The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013 establishes a new agency to replace the existing Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January 2014, as prescribed under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The new agency will be responsible for approved providers of home and residential care to deal with quality assurance of their services. There will also be other new bodies, including the aged-care pricing commissioner, which will be yet another layer of regulation on pricing and will place further burdens on providers and consumers. There will be some changes to home care, including replacing community care and some forms of flexible care delivered in a person's home, such as Extended Aged Care at Home and Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From July 2014, there will be changes to the way that homecare subsidy and fees are calculated for care recipients who enter home care on or after 1 July 2014. Key changes will include requiring some care recipients to contribute more to the cost of their care through an income tested care fee, that no full rate pensioner will pay an income tested care fee and that new annual and lifetime caps will apply to income tested care fees. In the changes to residential care, the government has proposed that care recipients who can afford to can contribute to their accommodation costs through a fully refundable lump sum, a rental style periodic payment, or a combination of both. The periodic daily accommodation payment is the implied preference of the government, despite the evidence given during the Senate committee's inquiry that the lump sum option provides greater stability to the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the minister has also announced a $1.2 billion workforce supplement, which imposes further regulation and red tape on providers. Minister Butler first intended to negotiate a workforce compact with both unions and employees with consultation and the support of aged-care providers. That did not happen, because providers were forced to boycott the process when they discovered that the true intention of the minister was to increase union membership without any real attempt to actually improve services in the industry. Such was the level of disgust by the providers at this abuse of process that the minister could not even find one aged-care facility to host his announcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the proposed workforce compact, providers with more than 50 beds will have to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement and meet certain so-called workforce obligations to access funding under the compact. Providers with less than 50 beds would be required to meet the workforce obligations but will not be required to enter into an EBA to access the funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there is no guarantee that this supposed increase will actually reach workers. The minister has previously admitted that he does not know how many of the nation's 350,000 aged-care workers will benefit. What we do know is that with only 40 per cent of providers operating in the black, many of them will simply be unable to pay the wage increases and the associated ongoing costs such as in administration and superannuation. The cost pressures will further erode their viability, especially for smaller providers in rural and regional areas, as identified by the previous speaker, the member for Maranoa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forcing providers to enter into EBAs means that more aged-care workers will be forced to join a union. Unfortunately, they do not have much to choose from: there is United Voice, the Australian Nursing Federation and, of course, the notorious Health Services Union. United Voice, Minister Butler's former union, has recently put out a publication, using this new workforce compact as a call to arms for workers to join the union. It states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most employees on award wages need to negotiate an Enterprise Agreement to get the pay rise. To win a good agreement, all potential members are urged to join United Voice to speak with one voice in negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This compact—negotiated only with unions, not providers—is a backdoor way to coerce more aged-care workers to join a union, including the HSU. It is an industrial mechanism to unionise the sector dressed up as an administrative change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have a real plan to take real action for older Australians and the aged-care sector. We will provide certainty of care through the first ever four-year aged-care provider agreement with the aged-care sector. We will establish an aged-care bed incentive program to provide $335 million over four years to convert up to 3,000 of the allocated bed licences to operational residential aged-care beds in the first term. We will provide convalescent care to assist up to 20,000 older people waiting in hospital to return home. We will ensure a high standard of quality care and less red tape, and we will support the continuing contribution of senior Australians through dementia programs and other community based programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the increasing difficulties the industry faces, we simply cannot continue with piecemeal approaches to the aged-care sector. We simply cannot allow this Labor government to rush incomplete legislation through the parliament without giving all relevant stakeholders the opportunity to have their say. Today's measures will only add further regulation to an already highly regulated sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday night we listened to yet another deficit ridden budget speech from the member for Lilley. The Treasurer spoke—at length—about his 'Budget for the Future'. But nowhere did he mention the future of aged care; nowhere did he mention the future of older Australians. Australia needs a government willing to listen and a government with the determination to invest in genuine reforms for the aged-care sector for the benefit of providers and consumers. The coalition has been listening, and will continue to listen. Only the coalition will restore hope, reward and opportunity and give a real future for older Australians who deserve our support. I would also take this opportunity to remind the chamber that next week is National Palliative Care Week and I hope that everyone will promote that very important event in their own electorates.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="PK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RANDALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 in the cognate debate with the other bills that have been described by previous members. I wish to briefly outline why we are here, the history of why we need to be here and then explain why this bill is relevant to my electorate of Canning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that these bills are the legislative response to the government's aged-care reform package announced in April 2012 which, as I said, has been called Living Longer Living Better. The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 seeks to remove the distinction between low-level and high-level residential care so there will only be one approval process. It provides a new means test combining income and assets tests, new annual and lifetime caps on means-tested aged care. It will allow accommodation costs to be paid through a refundable lump sum, a rental style periodic supplement or a combination of both. It will make changes to Home Care, including requiring a contribution for people that enter a home for care on or after 1 July 2014. It will establish a new aged-care pricing commissioner. It will extend the operation of the Accommodation Bonds Guarantee Scheme to new bond arrangements reflected in the government's reforms. It will establish the new Australian Aged Care Quality Agency to replace the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 July 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why we are here is because in 2010 at the election Prime Minister Gillard said aged care would be a second term priority. We have seen the government undertake report after report and review after review, including 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports. If you remember, they did three reports here but they would not do one on the NBN. The Productivity Commission's <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians</span> report was publicly released by Prime Minister Gillard and Minister Butler on 8 August 2011. Instead of responding in any meaningful or quick way, Minister Butler embarked on more talking. He called it a national conversation but it was simply a talkfest. At their news conference, the Prime Minister did not respond to any of the 58 recommendations in this report. Finally, almost two-thirds of a year later—256 days later—on 20 April 2012 the Gillard government announced its Living Longer Living Better aged-care reform package in response to the Productivity Commission report. But this legislation which we are dealing with today cherry-picked a few of the recommendations made by the Productivity Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some issues with this legislation. With this Living Longer Living Better announcement, whilst the headline figure of $3.7 billion over four years sounded impressive, the actual amount of new money—and I stress 'new money'—to be spent was only $577 million; in other words just over half a billion dollars over that four-year period. It is interesting, isn't it? The government—as we heard in the budget on Tuesday night—can come up with something like $5 billion as a knee-jerk reaction to illegal arrivals in this country, yet only half a billion dollars for the aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The so-called 'new' spending is a combination of means testing and simply cutting funding from one area and redirecting it to another—in other words, re-announcing it. It is worth noting that with this legislation many of the changes will not start, as I have already said several times, until 1 July 2014, well after the coming election, and it will be interesting to see whether Mr Butler gets an opportunity to have any say in its implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that the aged-care system needs urgent change. The ageing of our population is one of the biggest social issues that we face as a country. We have an ageing population that is obviously living longer. Around nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older and this is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and 20 per cent by 2051. In the electorate of Canning, 10 per cent of the electorate's population is over 70 years of age according to the latest census data. That is why we need proper structural reform of the aged-care sector so that the care and wellbeing of our older Australians are properly managed and care providers can remain viable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this package of five bills does not resolve many of the outstanding viability issues for providers. The $1.6 billion cut to the aged-care funding instrument, ACFI, has caused great angst amongst care providers and has placed them under substantially more pressure. The ACFI changes were supposedly made because of spurious assertions of provider rorting. As the member for Ryan and others have made clear, despite these claims made by the minister of unusual claiming at estimates in February 2013, it was revealed that there have been no prosecutions in at least five years. So if there is an allegation, where is the follow-up? There is none. The minister said he would investigate these serious allegations, yet there has not been any report to date, and with four weeks of sitting left for this parliament, I suspect there will not be any.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, this legislation will add even more regulation and more red tape to the already highly regulated sector. This is one of the things that makes it not only costly but also very, very difficult for them to do their job, the fundamental job that the providers are there for and that is to give quality aged care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One dubious aspect of the legislation is that it seeks to establish the framework for the workforce compact, which will be potentially costly for providers and appears to be a mechanism to unionise the sector—and this has been spoken about by other speakers as well. The $1.6 billion cut to the ACFI will be used to finance the $1.2 billion workforce compact component—notice the $400,000 shortfall. Under the $1.2 billion workforce compact, providers with 50 or more beds need to enter into an enterprise bargaining agreement, in other words, an EBA to access this funding. Isn't it funny? It sounds like the 'no ticket no start' is out there again but this time in the aged-care sector. Providers with fewer than 50 beds need not enter into an EBA but must comply with the conditions of the compact to access funding. So if an employer meets the terms and conditions of the workforce compact, the aged-care workforce supplement will be paid. In other words: sign up or you will not get the money; join a union or you will not get the money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Ryan also pointed out the choices you have, one of them being the Health Services Union, the so-called discredited union that took the lowest-paid workers' fees and splurged them on themselves. We will not go into that now, but I think that it is one of the reasons that union is losing members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are being paid award wages to get the workforce supplement, the employer will have to increase your pay by at least 5.2 per cent this coming financial year. If you are being paid according to an EBA, being paid at least 1.5 per cent above award wages to get the workforce supplement, your employer must increase your pay by at least 3.75 per cent this financial year. Trudi Hodges, the CEO of Dale Cottages—a residential accommodation centre in Armadale in my electorate—is rightly concerned about these wage increases as it affects their ability to pay their workers and attract staff. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one is saying that the wage increase is not a good thing. The Howard government oversaw real wage increases of more than 20 per cent during the term of that government. But rises in wages need to be affordable and sustainable. With only 40 per cent of residential aged-care providers operating in the black, they are rightly concerned. Eighty-nine per cent of the aged-care providers will suffer irrecoverable losses of revenue under the ACFI changes from 1 July as they already stand. The average loss per aged-care facility is more than $125,000 each year with some facing revenue shortfalls up to $560,000, with smaller and rural facilities most affected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, again in my electorate, Irene Mooney, the CEO of Quambie Park, a small provider in the rural location of Waroona, also has grave concerns about this legislation. The feedback she has provided to me comes from a group of age-care providers known as the Small Providers Group. This is a group supported by Aged Care Services of Western Australia, one of WA's aged-care peak bodies. The feedback from this body of small providers says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Indexation needs to be locked into subsidy payments on an annual basis (same as the current indexation application to basic daily care fees) for both Aged Care Funding Instruments (ACFI) and Community Care subsidies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time does not permit me to go into all of the ramifications of the recommendations but, briefly, the current costs of capital development and construction and refurbishment are not viably supported by the current supplement payment. Occupancy in rural and remote areas when a vacancy arises may take a period of time to fill and the geographical area et cetera affects a whole range of occupancy issues. Activity costs for these small providers are also an issue. The workforce compact in its current form is telling aged-care providers what they need to do in terms of their staff, yet it does not allow them to cover extra moneys.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how this local provider feels because, unlike the Labor government, the coalition is interested in working with providers for the best possible outcomes. She knows what the problem is and this coalition knows how they feel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged and Community Services Western Australia, ACSWA, has made a submission to the Senate inquiry highlighting its serious concerns about the workforce supplement, particularly its impact on smaller regional, rural and remote aged-care providers. ACSWA has provided us with an example:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An aged care provider who operates a small 31-bed RRR facility would be eligible to receive $17,000 under the Workforce Supplement principles but in order to receive this, would have to commit to an additional $30,000 in wage supplementation support (that is, $47,000 in total). This amount additionally does not include on-costs for the provider which must also be absorbed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the points mentioned above, one major area in aged-care reform that has been overlooked is a commitment to reduce the administrative burden that continues to hamper this sector. The coalition has been advised that aged-care nurses spend an average of a third of their time on paperwork, which takes them away from their caring duties. Under the Labor government proposals this can only get worse. The government's establishment of the Aged Care Funding Authority creates another bureaucracy—surprise, surprise—based in Canberra and trying to deal with people 3,000 kilometres away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to the Labor government, the coalition wants to work in partnership with the aged-care sector to achieve real and sustainable reform through our first-ever four-year aged-care provider agreement. This will provide certainty for the aged-care industry and there has been a positive response to this aspect of certainty. This high-level interaction and level of certainty have been absent in recent years under the Labor administration. For example, the recent debacle with the ACFI cuts would not have happened if a four-year agreement had been in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we will revise our policy closer to the election, the fundamental framework of the first-ever aged-care provider agreement will be retained. This agreement will deliver better and more affordable aged care because the crux of what we intend to do is: reduce red tape to enable nurses to get back to nursing residents; provide certainty, underpinned by a high-quality framework; deliver value for money through revised subsidy arrangements; ensure certainty for the aged-care workforce; establish a more flexible and viable aged-care provider network to meet care needs now and into the future; and ensure that the comfort and safety of older Australians are maximised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition wants this agreement to be in place within a year of taking office. As part of the process the coalition will establish a high-level aged-care provider agreement steering committee of key stakeholders to oversee the administration and implementation of the agreement and provide advice to the minister. In addition we will establish an aged-care provider arrangement working group, which will undertake the detailed design and project work required to give effect to the agreement. These measures will provide a formal pathway for a dialogue between the minister, the government and the stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot stress enough how the coalition values the input from the industry, who are the real experts in this area. The discussions with aged-care providers in my electorate have been invaluable. People like Trudi Hodges, the providers in Waroona and those right throughout the electorate are gravely concerned about funding going forward. At the moment it is very difficult for a provider to establish a business case. In fact, people are giving back their bed supplements and licences because they are unable to build a business case. While this is happening it takes away the opportunity for our frail and very aged Australians to seek quality aged care in this area. They deserve better. Should we be the government after 14 September we will provide that. This legislation does not provide that; it provides greater bureaucracy.</span>

This report is part of the committee's ongoing oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in which it seeks to determine if ASIC is fulfilling its statutory responsibilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the corporate markets and financial services regulator, ASIC is responsible for monitoring the integrity of Australia's financial system. Areas within ASIC's remit include promoting financial literacy and consumer education, corporate financial services, consumer credit regulation and the supervision of trading on Australia's licensed equity derivatives and futures market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry focused on key areas of ASIC's responsibility as well as issues of particular interest to the committee relating to topical and significant matters before ASIC. The standard of audit quality has been a concern for ASIC in recent years. ASIC's most recent audit quality report found a further decline in auditing standards. In its quest to improve audit quality, Australia has two crucial and unique attributes: firstly, an audit regulation framework and, secondly, an audit review process and in particular ASIC's audit inspection program. ASIC is a statutory body under the federal legislation, and accounting and auditing standards and auditor independence are all legally enforceable under the Corporations Act. These factors contribute significantly to the robustness of the audit regulation framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ASIC oversight hearings in March 2013 provided the committee with an opportunity to explore audit quality issues with some of the bodies involved in the auditing process, including the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, the Financial Reporting Council, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, CPA Australia, Treasury and ASIC. The committee recognises that auditors play a crucial role in the system and is keen to ensure that ASIC retains a strong focus in this area. ASIC has responsibility for the supervision of real-time equities trading on Australia's domestic licensed market. Part of ASIC's remit is to examine market changes and determine the adequacy of the existing regulatory regime. ASIC's key objective is to promote investor confidence through fair and efficient markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's financial markets are undergoing significant structural and behavioural changes. Two areas of evolution both within Australia and globally are high-frequency trading and dark liquidity, which is also referred to as 'dark venues' or 'dark pools'. High-frequency trading and dark liquidity have been the subject of considerable media attention and public concern. On 18 March 2013 ASIC released two reports on high-frequency trading and dark liquidity. The committee has examined these reports and will be pursuing the issues raised in these reports at the next oversight hearing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's 2009 inquiry into financial products and services led to the introduction and passing of the future of financial advice legislation to reform the financial services industry in Australia. ASIC undertook a consultative process on developing the FoFA reforms, including well-attended workshops in capital cities around Australia. ASIC has now finalised its regulatory guidelines on the FoFA reforms and has indicated it will take a constructive and facilitative approach to compliance in the first year.</span>

Indeed, go one step further and give blood at the Red Cross bus, which will be parked outside Parliament House on 24 June. We encourage everyone to roll up their sleeves and give blood. One in three Australians needs blood in their lifetime; one in thirty donate each year. We need 27,000 donations each week, and I look forward to seeing many of our colleagues there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise to praise the work of the wonderful staff and volunteers at Guide Dogs Victoria. Recently I had the privilege of visiting Guide Dogs Victoria to celebrate International Guide Dog Day. Guide Dogs Victoria, which is ranked one of the 'Top 3 Most Trusted Institutions' in Australia, is based at Arnold Cook House in Kew in the heart of my electorate of Kooyong. Now in its 56th year, Guide Dogs Victoria employs around 100 people, has nearly 2,000 clients and is responsible for providing more than 70 per cent of the working guide dogs in Victoria as well as guide dogs to a number of other states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, all services provided by Guide Dogs Victoria, including the provision of the dogs themselves, are provided entirely free of charge. Guide Dogs Victoria receives less than 10 per cent of its funding from government, none of which is designated to meet the costs of breeding, raising and training guide dogs. Funds for these purposes are raised only from private benefactors and public donations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I was at Guide Dogs Victoria I had the opportunity to talk with Karen Hayes, the organisation's dynamic CEO, as well as its president, Russell Walker. We talked about how more than 500,000 Australians are living with blindness or vision impairment and, with this number projected to more than double by 2020, there is a growing demand for services. I am sure I am supported by my colleagues from both sides of the political divide when I say a big thankyou to Guide Dogs Victoria, their staff and volunteers, and wish them all the very best for the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the distressing announcement from the heartless Queensland Liberal National Party government to close Nyanda State High School in my electorate. Nyanda's name comes from the old train stop in front of the school. It took this name after Salisbury State School combined with Acacia Ridge State High School, which closed down. So these school communities are used to change and heartache.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nyanda is a fantastic school located right in the heart of Moreton. I have visited the school many times and have always been impressed by the fantastic teachers and very strong multicultural school community. The area has aged a little since Billy Thorpe and Jamie Dunn went to that school. However, it is booming again, and following our nearly $800 million commitment to Cross River Rail and the lord mayor's plan to turn our suburbs into sardine cans, this suburb of Salisbury is going to explode in students looking for a school. This is very clear in the lord mayor's new city plan—a plan that will be signed off by Premier Campbell Newman. So we know the area is going to boom. However, the government has proposed to close down Nyanda State High School. Students need these education facilities now and without Nyanda they will be forced to travel excessive distances to schools that are already, some of them, at maximum capacity, putting more pressure on class sizes. This is not acceptable, and the uncertainty is extremely distressing for kids and their families, especially those in year 12.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP state government has already cut the funding to every single school in Queensland, state and private, because of their rounding down of student numbers and other cuts to state schools— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  This week, from 12 to 18 May, is Schizophrenia Awareness Week. Schizophrenia is a major mental illness that affects up to one in 100 individuals across all populations. During Schizophrenia Awareness Week we can all take the opportunity to highlight and focus on the issues that affect people living with a mental illness and also their families and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year for Schizophrenia Awareness Week there is particular emphasis on raising awareness of the physical health issues that people with severe mental health issues have to face. Research shows that people with severe mental illness have much higher rates of physical illness than the general population. Life expectancy has been shown to be as much as 25 years less than for the general population, and having schizophrenia means that you are 50 per cent more likely to have a stroke and 20 per cent more likely to get cancer and have a one in three chance of developing diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, however, evidence showing that improving physical health will increase life expectancy, and the current campaign during Schizophrenia Awareness Week is promoting improving physical health to increase life expectancy, quality of life and overall wellbeing of those with schizophrenia. I urge the community to understand the issues behind mental illness and to support those with a mental illness, their families and their friends.</span>

One of the oldest hospitals in Australia, the LGH has been an essential part of the health of the Launceston and greater Northern Tasmanian community since its beginning in 1806, firstly as a convict military hospital tent and later, in 1863, as a 102-bed hospital. Since then the LGH has developed into a first-class teaching facility and has led the way in many medical treatments and techniques.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The LGH is a world-class facility with wonderful staff providing great service for the people of Tasmania. Having spent a good part of my working life working at the Launceston General Hospital, I was thrilled to be able to successfully lobby for federal government funding support for the hospital's 150-year celebration. This will include an art exhibition, a three-day medical history and research seminar, scholarly lectures and the publication of a book detailing some of the medical history associated with the Launceston General Hospital's past. Once again, I congratulate the Launceston General Hospital on its 150th anniversary and wish everyone involved the best of luck with the celebrations that are happening this week.</span>

Unfortunately, owing to clerical error after the first page, only 21 meet the Petitions Committee's strict criteria, but I can assure you that there were 600. It was organised by Gayle Ganley from Jamestown, where there is a cadets unit. The cuts have meant that many have been unable to attend as many camps or as much leadership training as they have been able to do in the past. In the electorate of Grey there are cadet units in Kadina, Port Lincoln, Port August, Port Pirie and Whyalla, and Peterborough cadets travel to Clare. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I rise today to speak about a fantastic event that occurred in my electorate: the launch of a new vessel for Marine Rescue at Brunswick Heads. That occurred today at the Brunswick Heads Boat Harbour. This new vessel is a $340,000 offshore rescue vessel which really boosts the emergency capability of Marine Rescue New South Wales volunteers on the New South Wales North Coast. The formal commissioning of this new vessel, which is called <span style="font-style:italic;">Brunswick 30</span>, was a great event. The commissioner, Stacey Tannos, was there. Representatives from the Byron Shire Council attended. It was great to see that a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, Amanda Fazio, also attended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">Brunswick 30</span> forms a really important part of Marine Rescue's strategic safety net of offshore rescue vessels covering the New South Wales coastline. It really is a significant investment in the safety of local and visiting boaters. The vessel was built by local boatbuilders Yamba Welding and Engineering—a great effort by them. Our Brunswick unit commander, Owen Danvers, has said that <span style="font-style:italic;">Brunswick 30</span> provides the unit's volunteers with a really fantastic, lightweight, speedy and highly manoeuvrable vessel. It is a great asset to them and also for all the boaters that use the region. It allows a much faster response team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would really like to commend the unit commander, Owen Danvers, for the remarkable work that he does. I also commend all the volunteers with Brunswick Marine Rescue for the remarkable work that they do. They do an outstanding job in volunteering their time to assist people in our waters and also attending training in assisting people in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  On 17 April I hosted a community safety roundtable with Michael Keenan, shadow minister for justice, customs and border protection; representatives from the Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Valley Liquor Accord and Chaplain Watch; and local residents. It was an important day for both me and the shadow minister to hear from community representatives and residents of the local area. The coalition has a $50 million policy of using the proceeds of crime to invest in capital infrastructure to make the community safer. My electorate is home to many diverse social playgrounds such as Fortitude Valley, Caxton Street and the CBD. It is clear that the Commonwealth can have a role in providing funding for things such as CCTV, increased lighting and other measures that increase community safety. I want to congratulate the Valley Chamber of Commerce, led by Robin Maini, for the fantastic work they do in promoting the social and economic standing of the Fortitude Valley precinct. I look forward to working with them to confirm a funding package that will make this great suburb an even greater one.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />As a mother of young adults, I fully understand the need for the assurance that, when young people go out at night, they will be as safe as possible. That is why I am committed to continuing to work with the state and local government, the Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Valley Liquor Accord under the guidance of Nick Braban, Chaplain Watch under Lance Mergard, and other like-minded groups to improve safety in social precincts such as the valley, Caxton Street and the CBD. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I know that we have a few detractors here behind me. It took us four times to get there, but we did achieve the great win on 20 April, becoming A-League champions. On the day, Daniel McBreen and Patrick Zwaanswijk were those who struck gold for us. However, I want to acknowledge the incredible participation of the crowd. The Mariners are our team, but our famous cheer squad are the Marinators, who add spice and flavour to the game. But they did have a bit of competition with the Western Sydney Wanderers, who are very famous for their great singing and create a great mood for us. Again, congratulations to Graham Arnold, Lawrie McKinna and the whole team, who put together a wonderful, wonderful show; thank you to the 10,000 Coasties who shared that great victory with me; and congratulations once again to the Central Coast Mariners on a fine victory this year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday night in the government's budget we laid out our choice for Australia's future. We laid out clearly before the Australian people the future that we want to build for them. It is a future that would be fairer because it is a future that would include disability care. It is our way of supporting Australians with disability, their carers and families and of giving peace of mind to every Australian that, should the worst happen to either them or a member of their family, disability care would be there. We laid out before the Australian people very clearly the decisions we had made to fully fund disability care over a decade. Those were not easy decisions but the right decisions for the nation's future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday we deliberately chose a smarter future for our nation, investing $14.5 billion extra into school education, seeking to work with states and territories around the country on a two for one funding deal to make sure that every Australian school—all 9,500 of them—has the resources that they need in that school to get those children a great education tied with a plan for school improvement that we know will work because we have seen it work in Australian schools. We outlined our choice for a stronger economy in the future, an economy in which we support jobs and growth—decent jobs, jobs with good working conditions, jobs that Australians will want to do and be able to build their lives around, jobs of the future during this century of change in our region. These are jobs that will require us to have the best of infrastructure, the National Broadband Network and a clean energy future.</span>

I was making the very simple point that the opportunity the Leader of the Opposition has tonight is to lay out his alternate choice for the nation, a choice to cut to the bone, a choice that Australians should have the full information on so they can see the differences very clearly between the government's plan and what the Leader of the Opposition has in store for the Australian people if he has a chance. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Real funding for education has increased by 35 per cent since 2007-08, and what we have put at the heart of this budget—which everyone on this side of the House is proud of—is a very substantial increase in funding for the school improvement program. Over six years, $9.8 billion will go to improve schools right around our nation if we can get the state premiers to sign up. Barry O'Farrell has had the guts to do so. Other state premiers have not been so forthcoming, because the Leader of the Opposition has been out there trying to bully them into not signing up to a financial agreement which will mean better schools right across our whole nation. At least Barry O'Farrell in New South Wales has had the decency to recognise how important this future funding is for schools right around our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The spokesman opposite knows that the national partnership money has been rolled into this increased funding, and, as is usual, he comes in here fiddling the figures—distorting them—trying to conduct a fear campaign when we have got in place a program which is acceptable to the Liberal Premier of New South Wales for all of the schools in that state. But those opposite want to play politics with this issue. They are acutely embarrassed by the fact that they want to stop an existing funding model which in my state of Queensland, if they were in power, would mean $2 billion less for Queensland schools. I can tell you this: this is going to be an acute embarrassment for the Liberals in Queensland and those other states that have not signed up, because this goes to the core of what sort of Australia we want and whether there is a government prepared to make the investments for the future. We on this side of the House are prepared to make those investments; those on that side of the House have a plan for cuts to the bone, particularly in health and education.</span>

We do have a detailed plan to create prosperity in our nation and to spread opportunity to every postcode of our nation. What we are doing in this budget is building on our underlying economic streets. We have an economy which is 13 per cent bigger than it was before the global financial crisis, and it will be 22 per cent bigger by mid-2015. Something like 960,000 jobs have been created in Australia since we came to office, and we have got a AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies. What all this says is that we got the big economic calls right in this country when they were needed, and, in particular, we got them right during the global financial crisis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overnight we have seen some more disturbing data which has come from Europe. We have now seen that there have been six consecutive quarters of negative growth in Europe, and what is being done in Europe is they are following a policy of austerity—austerity for austerity's sake. What that is leading to is contractions in those economies and higher unemployment. We on this side of the House have taken a choice. We have taken the choice to support jobs and growth and to do that for the long-term benefit of our economy. The budget makes our economy stronger through critical investments in infrastructure but also makes our nation smarter because we have put in place additional investment for the school improvement program. Most importantly, it makes our nation fairer, because we are fully funding DisabilityCare Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess that is why it was so disappointing to see in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph </span>today that a source very close to the Liberals said that they would not be providing the same amount of money as the government would provide for DisabilityCare. They were telegraphing, if you like, in the Leader of the Opposition's favourite newsletter that they were going to cut funding for DisabilityCare Australia. On this side of the House there is a vision for the future, there are detailed plans and there is funding for a decade. What we know is on that side of the House is a plan for vicious cuts, a plan for cuts to disability and a plan for cuts to schooling, because what they are doing is following the approach of Campbell Newman. Campbell Newman took to the people of Queensland a whole set of proposals, none of which he did after the election. He had a commission of audit and he cut to the bone in the state of Queensland. He slashed health and slashed education. The Leader of the Opposition is going to try to skate through tonight not providing any great detail, and he is going to do that because he knows that, if he told the Australian people about his plans, they would never accept those sorts of vicious cuts to the bone.</span>

I remind the Treasurer that the budget projects a 90 per cent decline in illegal arrivals by boat over the forward estimates. This is based on a ten-year average that includes five years of the Howard government's policies when there were less than two boats arriving on average per year. How can the Treasurer credibly base his forecast on the coalitions policies that stopped the boats rather than his government's policies that started the boats?</span>

I was asked about our forecast yesterday and provided a detailed answer. I said yesterday that our medium-term forecasts are based on actual arrivals. We take advice from security agencies, we look at the history of the issue and, as we go out further, we look at historical averages. I made the point very clearly yesterday that the government will do everything within its power to stop the people smugglers. But of course there is one roadblock in the way of that: those opposite, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, have opposed key recommendations, that came to us through the Houston inquiry, to do more offshore processing—in particular in Malaysia. That is why I very clearly said yesterday that he is the best friend that people smugglers have ever had, because the opposition of those opposite sent a message to the region, and it was not a very good message at all.</span>

We do know that there are circumstances elsewhere in the world that are pushing refugees in our direction, not just to us but right around the world as well. We will engage, but what we need is the support of those opposite for the measures that are required to stem the flow of boats. We should not continue to have the fraudulent policy of the Leader of the Opposition, where he pretends that he can do something by tow-backs, back to Indonesia, which is not a signatory to the refugee convention. That is simply fraudulent. It is false from the opposition. We look forward to support the policies which will assist us in stemming the flow.</span>

We all share those sentiments. To the extent that we ever see images of animal cruelty, we are all revulsed by those images. I understand that, and the live animal export industry understand that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have worked with industry, once animal cruelty came to light—most particularly on a <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program. It became clear to me at that point that this industry, which is important for jobs, particularly in the north of Australia, was one where self-regulation was not working. I formed the view that if we did nothing it would become inevitable that Australian people would withdraw the social licence to this industry, and the industry would be no more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have worked with industry to put it on a sustainable footing and also to ensure that there are tracking and tracing systems for where animals from Australia are exported to, and the circumstances in which they are then dealt with in countries to which they are exported. We did that following a review led by Bill Farmer, and we have implemented the measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the member for Denison's question and his request for a personal guarantee from me, I think the member for Denison, like other members, would understand that as a matter of common sense we regulate many aspects of life in many aspects of business. We have road rules to regulate conduct on the road; we have our taxation system and the rules associated with it to regulate tax. Overwhelmingly, people do the right thing. There are times when people do not do the right thing and the purpose of having regulation and then having tracking and tracing is so that you can find instances where people have done the wrong thing and you can act on those instances. That is the approach we are taking to the live animal export industry, and the approach that we will continue to take.</span>

In this budget this government has had to make some difficult, but responsible, decisions to continue to make our family payments system both fairer and sustainable over the long term.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it is important for families that we deliver to those who need it most, and we deliver it when families need it most. That is, of course, why this government delivered Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme so that working parents could have some extra financial support to have time off from work when their newborn baby came along. Of course, our Paid Parental Leave scheme is fair to working women, unlike that proposed by those opposite, that would see ordinary working women and men paying subsidies of up to $75,000 to wealthy bank executives, or lawyers, to have a baby.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what those opposite want to do. We have seen the true colours of those opposite today, the true colours of those opposite. The member for Leichhardt, so out of touch with the needs of working women. The member for Leichhardt should be sacked: he is so out of touch with the needs of a working mother here in this parliament who needed time off to be with her baby.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also done the right thing by parents by introducing the Schoolkids Bonus. We know how important the Schoolkids Bonus is for parents. It really makes a difference when parents have those extra costs at the start and in the middle of the school year. We know once again that this is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to slash. He wants to get in there and get rid of the Schoolkids Bonus, which would see parents lose hundreds of dollars every single year. We know that the Schoolkids Bonus is helping parents; in contrast, this Leader of the Opposition just wants to get out there and cut it to the bone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is all about making what are sometimes very difficult choices, and this is a choice that is made in this year's budget so that we can fund the additional money that is needed for children's education. The Leader of the Opposition needs to come clean and make plain to parents: is he going to support the decisions, the difficult decisions, that this government has made in its budget, or does he have other secret plans that he is not going to reveal to Australian families?</span>

Not only is she doing as much as she can for families, but also I know that she, as a former teacher, cares enormously about what is happening in schools in her electorate. I can inform the member for Robertson that Australian families want a family payment system that is fair. They also want to make sure that they get that extra help when they need it most, and of course that does mean when kids are going back to school. There are 8,450 families in Robertson receiving the Schoolkids Bonus—that is, $410 for every primary school child, $820 for every secondary school child. What we know is that for all of those nearly 8½ thousand families in Robertson it is making a difference and lending them a helping hand when they need it.</span>

They will no longer get the support provided by this government through the Schoolkids Bonus that they need so much.</span>

Given that page 9-7 of his own Budget paper No. 1 reveals the market value of gross debt will actually peak at $370 billion—$14 billion more—how can the Treasurer be taken seriously when he does not even know the simple facts about Labor's debt?</span>

Here we go again; this is Moody's after the budget, 'Australia's relatively low level of government debt has been one of the factors supporting the AAA rating'. So this government has, for the first time in the history of the country, a AAA credit rating, a stable outlook, from the three major global rating agencies—not something ever achieved by the previous coalition government. That is because of the stewardship of this government, the way in which we have managed the economy in recent times. But they want to go around and exaggerate the levels of debt, and the purpose of exaggerating it in the way that they are is so that, if they get to power, they can go out and slash and burn when it comes to health and education. They want to pretend that our debt levels are not low; they want the excuse to rip out the social safety net and they want to follow a policy of austerity for austerity's sake.</span>

Former Prime Minister Howard said that in the last couple of weeks. So stop the fiscal fearmongering. Give us some detail tonight, and when we do not see it we will know that you intend to hide your real plans from the Australian people.</span>

It is not the value. It is the face value that counts when it comes to the debt cap. And, of course, these matters are handled by the AOFM and you can go to their website any time you like and have a look at the face value of securities issued by the Australian government. Now they have decided that the face value is very important, but it was not a figure that was ever published by those opposite when they were in power. We publish because of the Charter of Budget Honesty, and because of all of the requirements of the ABS we publish the market value. But to pretend that there is some issue, if you like, with the face value issuance of our government securities is just part of their fear campaign.</span>

Indeed this is a federal Labor government that has been making investments to make the economy stronger to ensure that we are a smarter and fairer society. We make substantial investments in our regions and in our cities and we invest in rail as well as our roads. Investment in rail, of course, takes cars and trucks off our roads and makes our roads safer as well as more productive, and this year's budget continues that commitment. If you look at the big projects, at the big roads, at the Hume Highway, the duplication fully from Sydney to Melbourne will be finished in the next two months. If you look at the Bruce Highway, $5.7 billion committed compared with $1.3 billion over a similar period of time by those opposite. If you look at the Pacific Highway, $7.9 billion committed compared with $1.3 billion from those opposite. If you look at the Pacific Highway, which is of particular interest to the member for Page and the member for Richmond, and you look at the work, work will be completed in the next financial year just north of Grafton at the Devils Pulpit section. Work will continue to the north of that on the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale section, where we have over half a billion dollars of federal funds committed, completing the preconstruction activities between Tyndale and Maclean and Harwood on Chatsworth Island south of Woodburn and north of Broadwater—all of that work funded.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the next year work will start on duplication—in the next couple of months, indeed—on the long overdue Frederickton to Eungai section and on the sections between Oxley Highway and Kundabung, Kundabung and Kempsey, Warrell Creek and Nambucca Heads, Nambucca Heads and Urunga—all of which has received the support of members on this side of this House, as well as the member for Lyne.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked how this report has been received. Well, last month I opened the Kempsey bypass, the longest bridge ever built in Australia. The member for Lyne was there. It was promised, funded, built and opened by this government; 100 per cent funds from the Australian government, zip from the New South Wales government. But I thought, well, what have they got against funding this section of road—not one cent. The local member, the member for Cowper, did not bother to show up. So they did not bother to participate in the community activity but there was some funding. There was funding of this full-page ad by Andrew Stoner from the National Party with the state infrastructure minister and leader of the New South Wales Nats claiming credit.</span>

I refer the Treasurer to his interview on Melbourne's 3AW yesterday with Neil Mitchell when he was asked, 'Will whoever win the next election need to raise the debt ceiling?' and the Treasurer answered, 'Well, that will be a matter for them.' Given that the Treasurer has admitted that increasing the debt ceiling will be a matter for them, will the Treasurer apologise for telling the House 'it is not necessary to do anything about the debt cap at all'?</span>

I said it was not necessary to lift the debt cap, we would review it in the usual way and we would amend it if it was required. That is what I said in the House yesterday. Now what we have here is a situation where the shadow Treasurer is running around quoting the market value of Commonwealth government securities when he knows that what counts for the debt cap is, of course, the face value.</span>

Now if he would like to go to the AOFM website he could have a look there and see what the face value of securities on issue is. Currently the face value on issue is $268 billion—but he wanted to come into this House and pretend it was a far higher figure. So that is all part of his strategy for fiscal fear mongering. Well, I can certainly say to the shadow Treasurer that it does not need to be lifted in this year or next year.</span>

I know how important it is to her that these students in her electorate are receiving the support from this government. Let me just look quickly at an 'us versus them' scenario to let people understand what we have done in the past and what we want to do in the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the member's electorate we have spent $131 million. Seventeen libraries have been improved, 23 multipurpose halls and 21 classrooms—incidentally, about 3,000 libraries have been supported nationwide. When they were in office there were around 3,000 flagpoles supplied. Then let us look at the national curriculum and the introduction of a national curriculum with world's best standard material to be taught to kids in schools. The only contribution that we have had from the opposition was to pull the Union Jack out of the bottom drawer and reheat the history wars.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then let us look at trades training centres—fantastic facilities. In the member's electorate she has two trades training centres. Eight schools benefit, and nationwide over 1,000 schools are benefiting from trades training centres. The coalition managed to knock up about a dozen Australian technical colleges and then wanted to cut this program in the last budget. That gives you an indication of both priorities and track record between this Labor government, which is committed to education, and those opposite, who are committed to cutting it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget we laid out the plan for the future supported by $9.8 billion of investment. It is a future where Australian schools keep pace with schools in our region, a future where Australian students get to reach their full potential and a future where a student, no matter where they live and no matter how much money their parents earn, get the same high-quality education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked by the member how it has been received. There are plenty of things that I could refer to, but I thought I would just take the Australian Primary Principals Association media release. Here it is, 'Federal budget school funding welcomed'. It is important to refer to it, because these are the school leaders and this is what they said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is very pleasing to see the increased school funding in the Budget for the next six years, a system of properly indexed funding for schooling based on the appropriate school resource standard and loadings based on need. This will be the backbone of school improvement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We absolutely agree and that is what we are totally committed to, and that is what is provided for in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition does not want to support the National Plan for School Improvement, which will see increased investment going to schools around the country. That means they will get less money, not more. Yes, they want to sack one in seven teachers, but they are not willing to commit to a National Plan for School Improvement which means that we as a nation can be sure that our students are getting the very best education they deserve.</span>

I thought that after the experience this morning, they would not turn up. But they are getting a very good dose of parliamentary education and we welcome them to the chamber at question time.

                  </a>  Exactly, and I have just said to you that we will not need to lift our debt limit this financial year or next financial year. I have made that point and that should be sufficient. But if he is very interested in this, he can go to the AOFM website and go through the material. They are regularly briefing the market about issuance. They are doing all of those things and that is where this is appropriately done.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Speaker. I was just pointing out that in the Liberal Party's world there is no level of responsible debt. Their approach to our current situation is that they would take an axe to health and education and an axe to jobs in our economy. Just because the global economy has taken an axe to our budget, that does not mean to say that we should take an axe to jobs and health and education in this economy. That is clearly what they would do, and that is the approach that they advocated during the global financial crisis. They said that we should not have a responsible level of debt to support jobs and growth in our economy and they would have seen this economy go into recession. They would not have had the guts to do what we did when we were faced with that set of circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been faced with a new set of circumstances and we have responded in a responsible way. We responded in this way because we on this side of the House understand how important employment and job security is to all Australians wherever they live. Those on that side of the House are just playing from the playbook of the Tea Party in the United States. There is no level of responsible debt in the views of those people. In the views of those extremists and some people over there, there is no level of responsible debt and therefore when you hit a bump in the economy, when something happens globally, you do not do anything to support your economy. You take an axe to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is something this government will never do. Everyone over here is really proud of what we are doing to support jobs and growth. Those opposite would do directly the opposite. They would slash and cut and burn and follow the Campbell Newman approach and cut jobs right across our economy. That is not the Australian way.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BRADBURY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:45</span>):  I thank the member for Makin for his question. The government has a responsible plan to build a stronger economy and to support jobs and growth. A responsible plan means that your plan must be fully funded and fully costed. That is why the budget that the Treasurer handed down earlier in the week sets out and locks in a fully funded 10-year plan to deliver on big initiatives, big nation-building initiatives, that will make our economy stronger and our society smarter and fairer—initiatives like DisabilityCare and our Plan for School Improvement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To fund these initiatives we have had to make some choices and we have had to deliver $43 billion worth of responsible savings measures. Tonight the Leader of the Opposition will have his opportunity to show us the sorts of choices that he is prepared to make, to lay his plans out on the table so the Australian people can see what it is he would do if he were the Prime Minister. When he does that, to make sure that they are responsible plans they should be fully funded and they should be fully costed. Fully costed does not mean going off and getting some dodgy costings from an accounting firm of the sort that we saw them use at the last election. We have set up the Parliamentary Budget Office. They should be properly costed in a proper way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw today, however, a bit of a sneak preview of the approach that the opposition will take, when they came into this place and voted against a bill to crack down on tax avoidance—new measures to crack down on profit shifting and tax avoidance. If there is a rort, a loophole or a rip-off, they are in there to protect it. That is what they did today: they came in to protect it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the challenge of trying to put in place a responsible budget, we know that they will not crack down on the tax avoiders. So how will they fill the big black hole that has been generated by all of the unfunded commitments they have been making? The shadow Assistant Treasurer gave us a clue today when he was asked. He said, 'Cuts will have to be made.' That comes on the back of what the Leader of the Opposition had to say just a month ago, when he said, 'Some of the things we do will hurt.' The question is: who will they hurt? They will hurt families. They will hurt pensioners. We will see cuts to payments, cuts to pensions—cuts to the bone. That is what we will see from the opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The Leader of the Opposition needs to make sure that he takes the opportunity tonight to put his plans on the table, to show people what it is he intends to do, so that they have the choice between a government that has fully funded commitments and will deliver big reforms like DisabilityCare and a Plan for School Improvement or an opposition whose only plan is to make savage cuts, cuts to the bone. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer the Treasurer to the New Zealand budget, released a few hours ago, that forecasts faster economic growth, falling unemployment and a budget surplus one year earlier than Australia. How can the Treasurer insist that the government's budget of deficits, higher unemployment and slower economic growth is unavoidable when New Zealand has been able to deliver an earlier surplus without a major resources industry and with a strong New Zealand dollar?</span>

The fact that he could somehow say that the performance of the New Zealand economy is a better performance than the performance of the Australian economy leaves me completely dumbfounded.

                  </a>  Thank you, Speaker. Unlike the shadow Treasurer I am proud of what our country has achieved over the past 5½ years: 960,000 jobs. How have we done that? Because we have a responsible level of debt, we have a good fiscal policy which has been given the tick by the major ratings agencies and we are making major investments in our future—major investments in economic infrastructure, major investments in schooling—and, of course, making our country fairer. We can do all of these things if we have a detailed plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our budget we have put out a detailed plan about how we are going to grow our economy, how we are going to be a smarter economy to take advantage of the Asian century and how we can make our society fairer. We have done that within a responsible fiscal policy. Our performance across any range of indicators is far better than New Zealand's. So I feel very sorry for the shadow Treasurer, who wants to keep running our country down. He does not get the basis of our economic strength. He does not understand what we need to do to keep our economy strong. Of course, they will invent any reason to avoid laying out a detailed plan for the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The Treasurer will return to the question.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SWAN:</span>
                  </a>  Well, they will invent any reason, Speaker, for refusing to put out a detailed plan. That is why we have had the fiscal fearmongering in here today. They want to use the excuse of debt—which is low by any standard and far lower than New Zealand's—so they are not going to tell the Australian people what they would do if they were elected after September. We know they have a secret plan for savage cuts. We know that, and all of their economic questions asked in this House go to the very core proposition I have just put. When they come in here and say it is a big-spending government—which it is not—that is just code for saying that if they were in power they would slash and burn when it comes to health, education and jobs. That is why you will not see a detailed plan from the Leader of the Opposition tonight.</span>

We have a smarter, stronger, fairer approach to Australian workplaces, but there is a clear choice as the member for Reid alluded to in his question, because there is an alternative plan for Australia's workplaces. We saw the cat out of the bag last Thursday when the opposition proposed the sly, sneaky and stealthy reintroduction of unfair individual contracts. And on Monday we heard the retailers rub their hands in glee: if the Liberals get in, the good times roll on for Work Choices. Then, on Tuesday the hoteliers had a crack. They said they would pop their champagne corks; they said, 'Fantastic, we can tackle penalty rates'.</span>

So the views of the ratings agencies apparently do not matter to the shadow Treasurer. That is pretty frightening, if he does not understand that—very frightening. He can go and find a report from a firm here or a firm there. But if you go through all of the judgements of the market economists that have been published in recent times, they give the budget a tick because it is good economics and it is good for the country.</span>

The legislation has broad support from very diverse groups in the sector and support from the biggest debt and equity providers of finance to this sector: the ANZ Bank, and AMP Capital, respectively. Big providers like Catholic Health Care and Anglicare are urging the parliament to deal with these bills. Perhaps most importantly of all, consumer groups like the Council on the Ageing and Alzheimer's Australia have expressed their support for this legislation.</span>

We are looking forward to that report and we are looking forward to the debate that we assume will follow in that chamber. I urge the opposition to dispense with the delaying tactics in this place. Let's finish the debate when the House resumes the week after next and let's all get on with the job of providing better aged-care services to older Australians.</span>

Now that it is clear that the Treasurer's budget forecasts are based on a mining tax that is meant to increase tenfold to deliver the revenue over the next four years, a market-traded carbon tax that ignores market prices and an asylum seeker budget that claims a miraculous 90 per cent drop in illegal arrivals by boats, when will the Treasury just come clean and admit that the budget needs emergency rescue?</span>

                  </a>  By and large they are, yes, it is true that there has been a change in terms of the permanent head, but the group that is doing the budgets for us is substantially the group that was doing them for those opposite. We have accepted in full the forecast of the Treasury in our budget over our forward estimates. We have done that because they are realistic, and as I said before to the shadow Treasurer, if you read basically the analysis of the market economists, it generally accepts the central proposition that has been put forward in the budget in terms of our growth forecasts. If he denies that, he can do that at the risk of simply getting people up there to go and read what all of the credible market economists have been saying. I ask people to do that because this attempt to discredit our forecasts is despicable, because what they are doing is reflecting on the professionalism of our public servants—despicable and disgraceful. This is a political agenda which is designed to get the Leader of the Opposition off the hook because he does not intend to provide detailed plans for the future in his budget reply tonight, because he knows that, if he supplied the detailed plans that they really have for the future, they would be unacceptable to the Australian people because those opposite have an economic approach which endorses the approach of austerity which is being used so unsuccessfully in Europe. They do not believe in supporting jobs and growth like this government. We are members of the Labor Party; it is in our DNA, and we always do everything that we can to support jobs and growth. Yes, we have had a challenge in our economy over the past 12 months caused principally by a higher Australian dollar and a lower terms of trade. The dollar has been higher for longer and had a dramatic impact on the profitability of our companies. All of the profit based taxes are down, and it is not principally the resource rent taxes, as he dishonestly said in his remarks before. It is company tax, it is superannuation tax, it is capital gains tax, it is resource rent taxes—all of them are down to the tune of $60 billion, and the logical proposition that he is putting to the house today is that if they were in government, faced with these revenue downgrades, they would cut over the forward estimates by $60 billion, and then you would see some real damage to jobs and growth in our economy and you would see some real damage to the quality of education and healthcare in our country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  This is a time for questions and it is a time for answers. The Leader of the Opposition, having set his own test for his budget reply tonight, must certainly do this. If he endorses DisabilityCare, does he endorse every saving to pay for it and, if not, what are the alternate saves? Does he endorse our plan for school improvement? If not, does he take the responsibility of cutting half a million dollars off every Australian school? What is he going to do? What is he going to cut to fill the $70 billion black hole the shadow Treasurer revealed on morning television? What will be used to fill that black hole? If he is not taking the money off the mining revenue, what will be cut to make up for that $5.5 billion? If he is not taking the revenue from the carbon tax, what will be cut to make up that loss of revenue? What is on the chopping block—health, education, pensions or family payments? The real answer is all of it, and the Leader of the Opposition should detail every cut tonight, every cut to the bone. With those words, I ask that further questions be placed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>

The bills had been referred to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts for an advisory report. Contrary to standing order 148, the bills went through all stages prior to the committee reporting. I note the oral advisory report was given soon after the passage of the bills.</span>

It is the government's intention that, if we can carry expeditiously the aged care legislation, we can then suspend for the period before the Leader of the Opposition's address to the parliament this evening. I will have discussions with the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business to ensure that can occur. There are only opposition speakers remaining on the list for that legislation. My understanding is that there will need to be a number of divisions on that. So it is in your hands in terms of what time we suspend. I would not be averse to suspending either a little bit earlier or a little bit later, depending upon what time we can carry those bills. But perhaps we might, by agreement as well, have a truncated MPI debate so that can occur. I thank the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Delay the return to surplus'! Under Labor there will never be a surplus. In spite of promising 500 times, going way back to 2010, that there would be a surplus in 2012-13, there is no surplus and there is, frankly, no surplus in sight. Five record budget deficits and two more at least yet to come. But no-one really believes that Labor has a plan in place which could actually deliver a surplus. The current Treasurer is pathologically incapable of doing it. The government is incapable of managing its finances to deliver a surplus. The government is so wasteful, so imprudent, so unable to manage its own affairs that there will always be deficits.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What alarms me about this government is that they do not even seem to care anymore about the deficits. We keep getting excuses: 'It doesn't really matter. There are other people with bigger deficits than us, so it doesn't really matter anymore.' What this government with its cavalier approach is doing is sentencing future generations of Australians to paying for their inability to manage their affairs. They are relying on an incoming government sometime in the future to pick up the bills for promises made but not funded in this budget—for the failure to be able to deliver a balanced budget over so many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been incapable of balancing this budget, even though it collects $80 billion more in revenue than the last budget of the Howard government. The Treasurer keeps giving us excuses about the global financial crisis, coolness in the resource sector or a range of other excuses. But whatever his excuses are, the facts are he has at his disposal in this budget $80 billion more than the Howard government had in its last budget. That budget produced a surplus. Labor cannot produce a surplus, even with $80 billion worth of extra revenue. The reason for that, fundamentally, is that it is spending $120 billion more than the last Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People might not mind so much if it were not wasted or if in fact there were genuine measures put in place to ensure that that amount could be paid for. But, in reality, the money has been wasted. Labor is spending its way into deficit. There has been no loss of revenue; there have been increases in revenue. What there has been is an extravagance of expenditure: on pink batts, on overpriced school halls, on all sorts of other wasteful programs—things that in actual fact have not delivered a more productive society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we see complaints again about a loss of revenue. There has been one phrase missing in Labor's rhetoric during this budget—one we heard a lot during the last budget—and that was the phrase that Labor was 'spreading the proceeds of the boom'. Today, the bad news is: there isn't any boom. This government has destroyed it. This government has driven away the incentive to invest. It has taxed away the capacity for people to want to actually invest in this country and deliver the boom. Labor has destroyed the boom. There are no proceeds left to distribute.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You just have to look at the mining tax. When it was originally proposed, Labor said it would collect $4 billion this year. Later they had to revise it downward to $3 billion and then $2.2 billion. But how much are they actually collecting? Two hundred million dollars. That is the proceeds of the boom: $200 million.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TRUSS:</span>
                  </a>  Lucky they are not in business—absolutely. And the prospects are not too much better for the future. The promised $22 billion is now down to $3.3 billion. As a result, they have had to go in and axe programs like the regional investment fund—$2 billion gone from the promises made to regional Australia. I wonder where the member for Lyne and the member for New England are. These are the people who backed the mining tax because they were given a promise that there would be investments in regional Australia. That promise was broken this week in this budget. The $2 billion promised is gone—the spreading of the proceeds of the boom that no longer exists. The government often talk about the extra tax that they would receive if they collected the same share of GDP as the Howard government collected. Well, if they spent the same share of GDP as the Howard government did, they would be in surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families have nothing to show for this government and its expenditure. What we got on Tuesday night was more debt, more deficits and more deceit. The Prime Minister's 'we will all share in the gain' mantra has now turned into 'we will all share in the pain'. Australian families are to be slugged with $25 billion in higher taxes over the next four years. There are more taxes on super, the higher Medicare levy, the removal of promised cuts to family tax, and a range of other tax increases. Labor like to say that they have made $43 billion worth of savings in this budget, but of that $43 billion worth of savings $25 billion is actually new taxes. It is not savings at all; it is taking more off Australian families and businesses for Labor's spending program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer has now confirmed that the gross government debt will not just exceed the $300 billion debt ceiling but bust it wide open at $370 billion. Yesterday in question time, when asked about this matter, the Treasurer said that gross debt in 2012-13 is $292.8 million; in 2013-14, it will be $321.3 million; in 2014-15 it will be $345 million; and the peak is $356 million. Putting aside the fact that he got his millions and billions mixed up—not altogether surprising for this Treasurer, particularly when he is drawing up his expenses and his receipts—he actually stopped the answer because, if he had read one more year, he would have got a peak of $370 billion. When they legislate to increase the credit card limit, which is what will have to be done for the fourth time, they will need a minimum of about $400 billion to keep up with their runaway expenditure—the debt that Australians have to pay back. The government cannot make light of it; it all has to be paid back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is even worse when you consider that they inherited, in the bank, $70 billion. They have squandered the inheritance, and the money that was put aside to help future generations pay for the extra health and welfare costs of an ageing society has all been spent and wasted rather than being a legacy that could be used when it is going to be needed to meet the extra costs of an ageing society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the previous Labor government left office, they had a $96 billion mess of net debt to be cleaned up. Paying that back took the coalition government the best part of a decade. It required prudent and responsible economic management by the Howard government and a really mature and patient understanding from the Australian people. There are 16 of us in the coalition who were ministers through those years, and we know the discipline that was required. It is staggering to think that paying back Labor's debt over the same period would require a $30 billion surplus every year. This government has never produced a surplus. The next government is going to have to find a surplus of $30 billion a year just to remove the debt, let alone starting to rebuild the nest egg that is going to be necessary to meet the cost as our society ages and to meet the costs that will be required to manage our economy and our society in the way we would wish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's idea of prudent financial management, at a time when cost-of-living pressures are skyrocketing, is adding more baggage to families and to businesses to further constrain the economy. The Treasurer keeps saying that, no matter who is in government, they will have the same challenge of falling tax receipts, which would have to be confronted in a tough budget. Well, the basic premise that receipts would have fallen even under a coalition government is wrong. Falling revenues directly correlate to the crisis of business and consumer confidence that has been created by this government. Hopefully, we will do things better, take advantage of the global situation and be able to build on Australia's natural strength. We have seen failed policies that impinge on investment—like the mining tax, the carbon tax and the chopping and changing in superannuation taxes that undermines people's retirement savings. Families are frightened about what is going to happen next under Labor. They are fearful that, if they stick their heads up and make a go of something, this government will come down on them like a tonne of bricks. Business investment is being deferred, and big-ticket consumer spending is also being deferred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is always desperate for excuses, but each one of these excuses is hollow. The Treasurer said again today that the high value of the dollar was the reason why the government was in financial crisis. Well, the reality is that the government does not get many figures right in its budget—some say it gets none—but, in the 2012-13 budget, the government predicted that the average value of the Australian dollar would be US$1.03. And guess what it was: US$1.03. That was the only figure the government got right. It budgeted on it being US$1.03, and now it wants to make an excuse because it got its budget right on one number.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They said, 'The trade weighted index has moved against us.' They got that right. They predicted it would be 77 in the last budget, and that is exactly what it has turned out to be. Now they want to use that as an excuse. This government has placed intolerable pressures on Australian families. Since Labor was elected, electricity has gone up by 93.8 per cent, water and sewage by 63.1 per cent, utilities by 79 per cent, gas by 61.8 per cent, insurance by 45.4 per cent, education by 38.7 per cent, rents by 30.2 per cent and housing by 29.6 per cent. Labor has imposed all of these additional burdens on families at a tough time. Yet through this budget they have means-tested family tax benefits. They have got rid of the baby bonus. They have frozen family tax benefits A and B. They introduced a flood tax in a previous budget and now there is a levy on Medicare. The government has cut and capped the childcare rebate. They have means-tested the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance. They have means-tested the medical expenses tax offset and now require an extra amount before anyone can claim it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are dozens of these additional tax burdens that Labor has imposed on Australian families. This is a government that has lost its way. It cannot balance a budget. It has no idea how it can turn our nation to prosperity to pay off its own debts. It has no plan for the future. The only way Australia will ever get its budgets balanced and be able to work with families to achieve a better life style for themselves and for their communities is for there to be a change of government. May the next budget be delivered by a different Treasurer and a different government which will be competent and manage our economy properly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KATE ELLIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  I am delighted with this opportunity to respond to the very real ways that the budget of this government is assisting with the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families. In doing so, I will do something that you did not hear once out of the 15-minute rant we just heard from the member opposite. That is to actually talk about some real measures, some real policies, some real costings and some real funded responses to benefit Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Did anyone hear one single policy from those opposite that would assist Australians with their cost-of-living pressures? Not one single idea, not one single real funded policy at all was put forward on a day when we are meant, according to the Leader of the Opposition, to hear a detailed plan from those opposite outlining what they would do in a budget put in place today to assist Australians with cost-of-living concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to start with one very simple principle that has led this government since our very first day. That is that one of the very best ways to address cost-of-living pressures for families is to foster an environment that provides jobs for families and that is exactly what this government have done. As a result, since we came to government more than a 950,000 jobs have been created. That is 490 jobs per day created since we were elected in 2007, whilst around the world we saw millions join unemployment queues. Around the developed world nations todays are still dealing with unemployment rates double, triple and more than what we have here in Australia. We were not prepared to sit back on our hands during the GFC as those opposite would have had us do and see Australia slip into recession. We know that the best support we can give for Australian families is an economy that supports jobs and support growth. So we are proud to be presiding over an unemployment rate right now that stands at 5.5 per cent, one of  the lowest in the industrialised world. In this budget we have kept our commitment to helping Australians to get and keep jobs, real commitment unlike the uncosted lack of policies and rants from those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through funding in this budget, the great work of our local employment coordinators will continue in 20 regions that are doing it the toughest in this country. There we will work at the grassroots and stand shoulder to shoulder with the communities that are not sharing in our prosperity. This is a great program. It is a program that has been singled out by the OECD as a best practice example of helping people get into jobs. Regions right around Australia will benefit from the $10.7 million announced in this week's budget for investment in local projects and partnerships. Communities in Ballarat, Bendigo, Bundaberg, Cairns, south-east Melbourne, south-west Perth, the Tweed and Clarence Valley and in northern Adelaide will benefit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program also includes support for more jobs and skills expos, something that this government has been incredibly proud to put on in places right around Australia that were hit hardest during the GFC. These have been incredibly successful. What we are talking about is real results and real support for Australian families and we know that, through the jobs expos we have already held, over 26,000 Australians have been placed in jobs. That is a real support not just to those individuals but to their families and their local communities and local economies. This is something that we are proud to continue to support in the budget that the Treasurer outlined this week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that throughout the GFC we have focused on keeping people in jobs, in creating new apprenticeships and on maintaining economic growth. Our responsible budget strategy has seen Australia achieve the AAA credit rating from all three global ratings agencies for the first time in our history, something that the Liberals could not achieve in over 11 years in office. When it comes to our responsible strategy, the proof is in the pudding. In the worst economic conditions in 80 years, our economy is 13 per cent larger. We have had solid growth and we have had contained inflation. We are the 12th biggest economy in the world, up from 15th. With Labor, our economy has grown more than six times faster then the economies of Germany and the United States. This is how we assist Australians with cost-of-living pressures, this is how we budget to make sure that Australians who would be left behind under the control of those opposite are supported by their government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if we want to talk about some more specific facts-and we did not hear a single one of from those opposite—let's put some on the table. Let's talk about some of the other supports that we have in place through this budget for families with their cost-of-living pressures </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps we could talk about the lower taxes, the three consecutive rounds of tax cuts in addition to tripling the tax-free threshold, and the one million fewer people who are paying income tax—anyone on $50,000 is paying $2,000 less in tax. That is a very real measure, one that we are proud to have put in place. We could talk about the schoolkids bonus giving eligible families with two kids—one in primary school and one in secondary school—over $1,200 a year. The schoolkids bonus is one of the few measures we have heard those opposite actually outline. They would scrap it and rip it away from those families who need it the most, making their cost of living issues even harder. We could talk about the historic increase to the age pension. Single pensioners on the maximum rate are now $5,300 a year better off. We know we are a government that wants to support those who are most vulnerable in our community, who wants to ensure that people do not get left behind and that recognises that older Australians, who worked their guts out for decades to build this country, should be looked after in their older age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">DisabilityCare Australia, the NDIS, is now law and will support hundreds of thousands of Australians with a disability in their families. We know that, in terms of cost of living, bulk billing rates have never been higher than under this government, reaching a record high last year with an average of 81.7 per cent of GP services bulk billed. This is a stark contrast to when Tony Abbott was health minister, when the bulk billing rates hit rock bottom at just 67 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get to specific measures—and measures which were mentioned by those opposite interjecting earlier—in my portfolio area, around childcare in particular, I want to talk about a couple of other budget decisions which will be incredibly important for those who have been struggling with cost of living issues. Perhaps in the budget from 20 March next year we could look at lifting the income-free area for Newstart and other allowances from $62 to $100 a fortnight. We will also be making study more rewarding for single parents on Newstart by allowing them to keep the pensioner education supplement. Finally, we will also let single parents who are transitioning from the parenting payment and off income support to keep their pensioner concession card for 12 weeks instead of two. All of these are real supports. All of these will assist Australians and their families with their cost of living issues. All of these stand in stark contrast to the policy-free zone that we see opposite us in this parliament, just months out from a national election, where they do not have a single policy to help Australians with these critical issues. There is our $1.1 billion income support bonus from this week's budget being rolled out. That is more than $210 for singles and $350 for couples, a permanent increase to payments paid for by this government—something that the coalition voted against. These are all facts, something that those opposite seem to be allergic to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to particularly focus on an area where I know it can be really hard for families: the area of childcare fees. That is an additional burden on their budget, and we have provided extra in that regard. In this area, our government and those opposite are absolutely worlds apart. In fact, what we saw in this week's budget is that we have more than tripled the investment in early childhood education and care from the level that those opposite were happy to see it stand at when they were in government. We do this because we know that these are the most critical years in a child's life. We also do it because we know it is incredibly important for parents to have some fee assistance when they are juggling the costs of this. We know that this is a record investment to improve access to quality care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a time that is a tough budget environment, in a time where we have found $48 billion in savings, we have increased our assistance in this vital area for Australian families. We have already increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We have already increased the cap from $4,354, where it stood under those opposite, up to $7,500 per child per year. In this budget, we have made a number of key choices around this. We know that it is vital for families to have assistance when it comes to childcare. We have decided that the rebate is not reduced; it stays at 50 per cent of the total cost for families. The cap on that rebate is not lowered; it stays at $7,500 per child per year. There are an unlimited number of childcare places that we will continue to fund. These payments are not means tested and are available for parents right across Australia so that we can assist them with their cost of living pressures and their move back into the workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's talk about choices. We know that those opposite would put all of these vital childcare payments for Australian families under threat, because, rather than having a policy, rather than confirming that they will not cut, means test or reduce the cap on the childcare rebate back to where in was when they were in government, they say to the Australian public, 'We'll do a review after the election and then we'll tell you what we are going to do your childcare assistance.' They say to the Australian public: 'Just trust us. We're not telling you that we won't means test it; we're not telling you that we won't cut it; but we will let you know after the election how much childcare fee assistance we will give you.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Australian public that we have seen this before. We have seen this from state governments right around the country—and we know what this means. This means, 'We will cut your assistance, we will cut your programs and we will not tell you until after the election.' Every time those opposite say: 'We'll review childcare payments. We'll send it to the Productivity Commission to do an inquiry and report back to us and we won't give any assurances about what will or will not remain in place,' I would just  remind people of one thing: every time we have asked the Productivity Commission to look at childcare, they have come back with the same recommendations. The recommendations are that we roll it into a single payment and that we introduce means testing. That is what they have said previously and that is what those opposite have refused to rule out doing after the election. I believe that cost of living pressures are incredibly important for Australian families. I believe that childcare fee assistance is incredibly important to Australian families. I believe that Australian families deserve to know what sort of fee assistance they would get under those opposite and I believe that tonight, in the budget reply, those opposite should come clean about what their plans are for childcare fee assistance and stop hiding under a post-election review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, we know it is not just about childcare. It is right across the board. They have already outlined that they will follow the pattern laid out by state governments around Australia. They will look at an audit post the election. They will look at what they can slash and what they can cut just like their state colleagues have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, when talking about the cost of living, we are hearing more and more about their real plans on industrial relations. We have heard more and more over the last few days. When it comes to cost-of-living support what Australian families need to know is that they have real penalty rates. They need to know that their wages are safe. They need to know that their conditions at work are not under threat. We know that it is in the DNA of those opposite—and we have heard it over the last few days and again today from Peter Reith—that they cannot be trusted. The party of Work Choices was and always will be the party that will be looking to strip wages and conditions from Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to talk about the real supports that we have put forward in our budget. The core principle of giving everyone a fair go and constantly striving to ensure that no-one gets left behind is in Labor's DNA. We know that it is in our DNA to put in place new and real measures to assist with the cost of living. That why this is a budget which protects those measures, which introduces real supports and which has funded policies and plans—which stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who say nothing except, 'Trust us; we will tell you what we are going to do after the election.' Today is the day that we all say that that is not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight is the opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to spell out exactly how he would assist Australian families with cost-of-living pressures, exactly how those policies will be funded and exactly what will be cut to the bone in order to support their ideology and the measures that we are seeing right across Australia. If anyone out there wants to see what this Liberal Party would look like if they came to federal government I would say to them that they should look to Queensland. Look to Campbell Newman. Look to the job cuts. Look to the programs that have been slashed. Look at what they are doing, in stark contrast to the assistance we are giving Australian families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  The reality is that Australian families are paying for the economic and fiscal incompetence of the Gillard-Rudd government. Not only is this an incompetent government—perhaps the most incompetent government that has ever graced the Treasury benches in this place—but it is also one that is fundamentally dishonest. From the very start, this has been a government that has been prepared to deceive the Australian people—'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Prime Ministers are often remembered for a phrase or some words. John Howard's famous quip about 'deciding who would come to Australia' is remembered by Australians. Well, if there is one phrase that Australians will remember this Prime Minister by it will be: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That promise that she made and then ripped up when it became politically convenient to ensure that she was able to sit in that chair and take her place in The Lodge set the tone for the Labor government that we have seen ever since. And the budget presented this week again shows the fundamental dishonesty of this government. We had it last year with the overblown spin and hype from the Treasurer, with words to the effect of: 'I'm announcing tonight four surpluses over the forward estimates into the future.' They were the words that the Treasurer started last year's budget speech with. Well, here we are just over 12 months later. What has happened to those four fabulous surpluses that the Treasurer promised the Australian people 12 months ago? You had to be listening hard to his budget speech this year to actually find what the deficit for this year is. That fabulous surplus turns into a $19.4 billion deficit for this financial year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just this year; next year there is an $18 billion deficit and the following year an $11 billion deficit. So four years of surplus suddenly turns into $19 billion plus $18 billion plus $11 billion worth of deficits—all accumulating and adding to the total debt of the Commonwealth of Australia. Those on the other side pretend that the debt of the Commonwealth of Australia somehow does not matter. But the frank reality is that it is the debt of all of us. We are the Commonwealth of Australia. You are the stewards for the people of Australia. And how have you conducted your stewardship? With fundamental incompetence and dishonesty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite cannot even be honest in the way they describe things. Listen to the conceptual language used by the Treasurer in question time today and on other occasions—the corruption of language which has occurred under this government. They talk about 'saves'. If you ask an ordinary Australian what a saving is they would say that a saving is that you do not spend what you might have otherwise spent—when you put the money in the bank, so to speak. That is what we understand a 'saving' to be. But we have got this new piece of political corruption of language going on in which the Treasurer and others opposite talk about 'saves'. What are those 'saves'? A large proportion of those 'saves' are actually tax increases. If you said to ordinary Australians, 'Saving money involves increasing the taxes on Australians,' do you think that people would believe that that is actually a saving? Of course not. That again goes to the fundamental dishonesty of this government—dishonesty in terms of the language that is being used in this place and elsewhere, where a 'save', connoting somehow that that is a saving in terms of expenditure, is actually an increase in taxes on ordinary Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the slogan that is being used about this budget. This is a budget, we are told, that is about growth and jobs. If somebody said positively that this is something about growth and jobs, what would your expectation be from the budget, from the government's program? The expectation would be that growth is going to increase and, equally, that jobs are going to increase. That is fair enough. That is what they are trying to pretend to the Australian people that this budget is about—growth and jobs. Well, lo and behold, look inside the budget papers themselves and see what they actually show. In terms of growth, the forecast from the Treasury is that growth is going to go down, not up. So it would be more accurate to say that this is about a lack of growth, about an absence of growth, about a decline in growth, than to somehow pretend, through their slogans and spin—their fundamental dishonesty with the Australian people—that this is somehow about growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about jobs? Again, look inside the budget papers. In those papers it shows the unemployment rate in Australia increasing, not decreasing. If we are talking about an increase in jobs then the corollary of that is that the unemployment rate goes down. And yet the detail of these budget papers shows the employment rate going up to 5.75 per cent from 5.5 per cent where it is now. Even to use the expression that this is a budget about growth and jobs is a fundamental dishonesty. It is trying to pretend one thing to the Australian people when in fact the opposite is happening, and that is why I say this is not only the most incompetent government we have probably seen in the history of the federation of the Commonwealth of Australia, it is a fundamentally dishonest government as well. If you look at that in terms of what this means for ordinary Australians, it means that they are going to pay for it. Australian families are paying for this incompetence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider the position of families in Australia under this government. In he cost-of-living increases since Labor came to power—the December quarter of 2007 through to the March quarter of 2013—nationally, across Australia, Australians are paying 93.8 per cent more for their electricity, almost a doubling in electricity prices under this government. Australians are paying 63.1 per cent more for their water and sewerage. For utilities, they are paying 79.2 per cent more—again, almost a doubling. Gas, up by 61.8 per cent. Even insurance has gone up under the duration of this government by 45.4 per cent. The government talks about schools—and I will come to that in a moment—education expenses and education costs have gone up by 38.7 per cent. Medical and hospital services—these are fundamental services that we are talking about—increased by 40.9 per cent. If you do not own your house and you are renting—many Australians are in that situation—30 per cent increase in rental prices in Australia. Of course, that has been compounded since the introduction of the carbon tax because, since the introduction of that, we have had electricity up by 18 per cent, and gas and other household fuels have increased by 14.1 per cent since the introduction on 1 July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to go to the dishonesty again in this government, I said that education prices have gone up by 38.7 per cent. Again, if you listen to this government, it says one of the lynchpins of this government is an increase in actual education reforms. Somehow, after the Gonski reforms we are going to be better off. A graph taken for the budget papers—it is not our graph, it is the budget papers' graph produced by the Treasurer—shows that over the next three years there are going to be more savings for the government from education reforms than there are from increased school expenditure. Once again, pretending one thing, spinning it one way, trying to convert the Australian people to believing that the government is doing the right thing. When you go to the detail in the budget papers themselves, what do we find? Totally the opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Australian families are paying for the incompetence of this government. Whether or not it is the changes to the family tax benefits, whether it is the slashing of the baby bonus—a measure put in place to try and do something to ensure that we maintain a replacement level, or near replacement level, of fertility rate in Australia, these changes and the other changes are being paid for by Australian families, and why? Because this government is incompetent, and now it is being dishonest about it. The combination of an incompetent and dishonest government is something which Australians have found out and they know about it, because as I go around this country—as all my colleagues do—wherever you go in this country, people will tell you straightaway, 'Why can't we have an election tomorrow?' They want to have an election tomorrow because they are sick and tired of the incompetence and now sick and tired of the dishonesty of this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that until we get a decent Treasurer—if somehow the Labor Party win the next election, you can be assured that Mr Swan will not be the Treasurer, his colleagues would make sure that—we are not going to have a decent command of the books in Australia, and Australia will not be prosperous as a result.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mrs D'ATH:</span>
                  </a>  My question is in relation to Australian families. At what point did we redefine the meaning of 'Australian families' to exclude people with disabilities? When did we stop thinking of people with disabilities as part of a family? Those on the opposite side keep saying there is nothing in this budget for families; there is no help for families in this budget. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, 'No hope in the budget.' We see from the MPI that according to the opposition there is no help for families, no easing of cost-of-living pressures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite hearing from the other side that they support the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the establishment of DisabilityCare Australia, what we see is the real truth when it comes to the opposition—how they value real reform in relation to disability care. They say there is nothing in this budget for families, and I say there is everything in this budget for families. There are families all over this country with children who have disabilities, family members who have disabilities, husband and wives who have disabilities, parents who have disabilities that are being cared for by family members. When do we in this country acknowledge these people as being Australian families? It is about time the opposition did. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to hear about slogans and what leaders are known for. We heard the member for Menzies talk about phrases from leaders, what they are known for and what people remember. I also remember the Leader of the Opposition saying there would be paid parental leave 'over my dead body'. The question is: if there was paid parental leave over his dead body, why is it that, in coming into government, the opposition would like to slug over 3,000 companies with a new tax to pay for paid parental leave? If we want to talk about well-known statements by leaders in this country I am happy to talk about the statements that the Leader of the Opposition has made in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us acknowledge what we are doing for people with disabilities in this country. It would be really great to hear from those on the other side that they actually appreciate the value of that help and what it means for the hundreds of thousands of Australians with a significant and permanent disability and for their families and carers. That money will also mean peace of mind for every Australian. Anyone who has or might acquire a disability will have a new safety net to rely on. To those who say that there is nothing in this budget, my question is: what are you actually saying in relation to disability reform in this country that you are not genuine about supporting it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is about providing a stronger, smarter and fairer system in this country. It is about supporting jobs and growth in this country. Again, those from the other side who have spoken on this MPI talked about there being no support for jobs or employment, in this budget. What do they think comes from investment in infrastructure? I was very disappointed to see that the member for Wide Bay, a Queenslander, did not stand up and support a budget that supports investment in infrastructure in Queensland. I heard him criticise the flood levy, a flood levy that helped rebuild Queensland after the significant floods in 2011. But when we talk about this budget, about investment in Brisbane—the Cross River Rail, the Gateway upgrade north, the Ipswich motorway, the $4.1 billion into the Bruce Highway package, the Warrego Highway upgrade, the Moreton Bay rail link—where was the opposition on these issues, on this investment in infrastructure?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about what we are doing, about cost-of-living pressures and families. How about the fact that it is this government that introduced Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, that it is this federal Labor government that lifted the childcare rebate to 50 per cent, that it is this government that introduced the schoolkids bonus, that it is this federal Labor government that lifted the rate of the family tax benefit part A for teenagers, and that it is this federal Labor government that introduced the dad and partner pay? We do not hear those opposite talking about these initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard that there are tax slugs for families. What about the fact that under this federal Labor government we have lower interest rates than at any time under the Liberals, saving more than $100 per week on an average mortgage? What about the lower taxes? There have been three consecutive rounds of tax cuts in addition to tripling the tax-free threshold. One million fewer people are paying income tax, and anyone on $50,000 is paying $2,000 less—that is how you help families in this country. I do not hear the opposition talking about those things. What about the fact that over 950,000 jobs have been created at a time when 28 million have been lost worldwide? What about the fact that our unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent is less than half that of Europe's, of 11.9 per cent? What about our AAA rating? If you want to take pressure off families, these are the things you have to talk about. What about low-income superannuation contributions? They were put in place from 1 July 2012—a tax cut of up to $500 per financial year to help low-income earners save for their retirement. How about the fact that if you actually want to help families into the future you give them the best education possible; you invest in high skills, in high-paying jobs. You do that by investing in education, industry and innovation in this country. You invest in research and development. That is what you do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took a federal Labor government to introduce a national curriculum across the country. For the first time, no matter where you go to school, you are learning the same thing. As someone who moved across borders as a child, I appreciate how far it can set a kid back to move across schools and find that they are teaching a single subject in a completely different way. You do not even have to move across borders; just by moving across government schools within a local area you would find they were teaching different things in subjects. That sets a kid back. A national curriculum is important, but so is investing in computers, libraries and multipurpose halls and new classrooms. What did the opposition do when they were in government? They provided flagpoles. That is great, but it does not help these kids' education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How about investing in social housing and rental affordability? We have just announced a further $1 billion in new funding under the latest National Rental Affordability Scheme. If you want to talk about how to ease cost-of-living pressures on families, how about easing those rental costs in properties? I welcome the new NRAS properties in my electorate and the ones that have been built that have supported jobs in our local community and have provided more affordable accommodation in our local area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to talk about electricity prices and the carbon price, let us do that. Let us talk about the fact that the annual review shows that the household assistance has come out and provided adequate and effective support for families, because those cost-of-living pressures—electricity prices—as a component of the carbon price have gone up by less than the amount we have provided to families. If you look at what the individual states are providing in that area, you will see from their own figures—not ours—that last month in New South Wales the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal electricity price determination ascribed $3.25 to the carbon price there. In South Australian the regulator ascribed a $1.47 per week increase because of the carbon price; in Western Australia, $2.50 per week; and in Tasmania, $2.45 a week. So if those opposite want to talk about electricity prices, be honest: it is the network charges that are the problem, but I do not see one Liberal state government stepping up and doing anything about those cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us talk about the opposition. We heard the member for Wide Bay say, 'We hope we would do better if we were in government.' Let us look at the 11 years that the Howard government was in government and having a surplus. Did they invest in health? No, they took money out. Did they invest in education? No. Did they improve the lives of people with disabilities? No. Did they invest in infrastructure across this country? Not at all, and we hear that they will still not do it. And they would not put one dollar into rail across this country. Urban rail is not a priority. Did we see them lift the base pension for pensioners when they were in government? No. It is only federal Labor that does that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E07" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARKUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I heard members on this side start with a statement about Australian families. Australian families deserve a stable, competent government that lives within their means and serves the best interests of those they supposedly seek to serve, and particularly to relieve the cost-of-living pressures that everyday Australians—mums and dads, families, single-parent families, families that are endeavouring to make a way for their children—face on a daily basis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the families of Australia have been hit once again by the economic mismanagement of an incompetent government. Families are endeavouring week by week, day by day, month by month, to juggle their income and their expenses; making decisions between paying a bill or buying food, whether to meet the needs of their children at school, paying for an excursion or paying a lighting bill. These are the challenges that everyday families are facing on a day-to-day basis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that the other side, the government of the day, fails to understand. My question is: are you really listening? Are you listening to the needs of your communities? I am not sure that you are. In fact I question that on a daily basis when I speak to the families in my community, when I knock on their door, when I see them when I am out at a street stall, and they come to me and say, 'Louise, I cannot pay my bills.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget does nothing to help Australian families deal with cost-of-living pressures, economic uncertainty and poor services. It does little to provide them with hope for their future. After six years of rising prices and increasing costs, our families need a break. The phrase 'cost of living' is not just a phrase; it bears little weight I think with the government of the day. What the government of the day fails to understand is that behind this phrase are thousands of families—small families, large families, single-parent families—that are doing it tough. These families are living with the fear of getting hit with another bill that they simply cannot afford. They plan a budget but then the bills keep rising. The budget blows out. But they are endeavouring to manage to live within their means; something that this government is failing to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families are trying to make household budgets stretch, to pay rents or mortgages, groceries, bills, petrol, school uniforms, textbooks, excursions. It all adds up. We know that parents try to do the best they can, but sometimes the numbers just don't add up and parents may have to go without to provide for their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have clearly lost faith in this government. At the heart of this growing discontent lies very deep and very real concern that this government is pursuing a course of extraordinary political and economic mismanagement that will burden our nation and people for decades to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of National Families Week, this week, Labor's budget has delivered another cruel blow to Australian families. The budget delivers more debt, more deficits, more taxes, more broken promises and a greater level of uncertainty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at this government's track record—and this was alluded to by members earlier. Since 2007, the cost of electricity has increased by 93.8 per cent. Water and sewerage has increased 63.1 per cent. Gas has increased 61.8 per cent. Medical and health services are up 40.9 per cent and rents have increased by 30.2 per cent. The member for Menzies mentioned earlier that these are not luxuries; these are basics. These are things that every family, every individual and every community needs to spend money on every week, every month, every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is just the start. There are numerous initiatives in this budget that disadvantage families. The abolition of the baby bonus is an example; an initiative delivered courtesy of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational Report</span> to ensure that Australia maintains an adequate birth rate. This will mean more than 150,000 families will be worse off. The increase to the Medicare levy will also hit family budgets. The average Australian family earning $70,000 a year will be $350 worse off. There was also the broken promise of child care. Child care was talked about earlier. Labor have broken their promise that the indexation of the childcare rebate would recommence in 2014. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor simply cannot be trusted. What is written in black and white by this Labor government today cannot be trusted tomorrow. At a time when childcare costs are increasing for more families, this decision will hurt financially. Families will also be worse off under Labor after the government announced an extension to the indexation pauses on income thresholds for family payments and FTB supplement payments until 2017. This decision will impact the 1.5 million families who receive family tax benefit part A and the 1.3 million families who receive family tax benefit part B, as the FTB supplement payments fail to keep pace with the rising cost of living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Macquarie there is a strong loss of confidence in both the economic and social future of our country. Families are clearly struggling. I spoke recently to the Stubbs family in Windsor, who have three children; two at school and one in child care. Their main concern has been the rising costs, particularly of their electricity bills. Every quarter it gets harder for them to predict what their bill will be—what will it look like—and it causes incredible levels of stress and uncertainty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our welfare centre in Katoomba, run by the Salvation Army, has reported a growing number of families reaching out for help over the last 18 months. This is reflected in every single non-government organisation that hands out emergency relief. People are requesting more help with paying bills, assistance with buying food and clothing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact many of these agencies refer to the 'working poor', families with one or two incomes who are struggling to pay their bills. That is something that was not happening five, six or seven years ago. They have also experienced an increase in participants in their program to assist families with their household budgets. This pattern is consistent across the nation. The number of families needing financial and material assistance through not-for-profit organisations has increased considerably. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say: this was not necessary. Only the coalition has a clear plan for easing the cost-of-living pressures for families. The coalition and I believe in Australia. We believe that all Australians deserve a brighter and more optimistic future. That is why we have a plan to build a stronger, more prosperous nation, so that all Australians can have opportunities in a global economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that strong families underpin a strong and flourishing society. They are our foundation. We must support families. We must create an economy and provide opportunities and rewards for hardworking parents. As a coalition we have a clear commitment to families. We will abolish the carbon tax, which has caused significant damage to families with rising utility costs. This tax has failed to achieve reductions in emissions and is hurting everyday Australians—pain with absolutely no gain. We will put downward pressure on prices, getting the ACCC to make sure that prices do not remain artificially raised when we abolish the carbon tax. We will fund personal income tax cuts for individuals and families. We will protect and strengthen Medicare by restoring the private health insurance rebate as soon as we possibly can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the urgent need for accessible, affordable and flexible child care for families, and we will have the Productivity Commission urgently undertake a major inquiry into the childcare system. We will look at different ways child care can become more flexible and responsive to the differing needs and lifestyles of parents. It is clear that work patterns and demands on parents are different today than they were even a decade ago. We will deliver a genuine paid parental leave scheme to give mothers six months leave based on their actual wage. This will mean that young families are given options and flexibility to balance work and family and will not be forced to survive on a single wage. The truth is, only the coalition understands economic pressure on families and only the coalition has a clear way forward for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a spending problem. It has been given enough chances to get it right. Enough is enough. The budget delivers more than $25 billion in higher taxes over the next four years, 99 per cent of which will hit Australians after the next election. After six years of chaos, debt and spin, Australians deserve stable and competent economic management so they can have confidence in a government that will live within its means and that will work to ensure that families have priority and that they have the opportunities, on a foundation that is firm, to step into their future with confidence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M2V" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MATHESON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance today because I hold great concern for the people of Macarthur, who are struggling to make ends meet. I am concerned, but not surprised, that this week's budget has failed to address the cost-of-living pressures on all Australians. Since elected, this Labor government has done nothing to ease cost-of-living pressures for families in my electorate and around the nation. Since 2007 the cost of electricity has increased by 93.8 per cent, the cost of water and sewerage by 63.1 per cent, the cost of gas by 61.8 per cent, the cost of medical and health services by 40.9 per cent, and the cost of rents by 30.2 per cent—certainly not a track record the government would be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rising cost of living has had a huge impact on the quality of life of many families in Macarthur. To put it simply: they have had enough. The people of Macarthur are hardworking, honest people who want nothing but the best for their children and the future generations of this country. More than 70 per cent of the workers in my electorate commute out of the area to work every day so they can earn a decent wage and compete with the rising cost of living. They are working hard to pay off their mortgage and balance the family budget. They are trying to decrease their own debt and reduce their credit limits. So you can imagine how frustrating it would be for them to see their own government's wasteful spending result in almost $300 billion of debt, reaching national debt record interest payments of $7.8 billion per year. That is almost $50 million per day in borrowings. The government does not have a revenue problem; it definitely has a spending problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently thousands of people across Macarthur raised with me, through Macarthur's biggest survey, their concerns about the rising cost of living. More than 90 per cent of our residents who took part in the survey said the cost of living was too high. Many families in my electorate are struggling to make ends meet. I recently met a lovely family in Rosemeadow, who said the rising cost of living means that their children are missing out on some of the things that they once took for granted. Mum and Dad are both working. One income covers the mortgage and the other income barely covers the electricity bills, water bills, grocery bills and council rates—all of which have gone up thanks to this Labor government's record debt and toxic carbon tax. This means there is no money left for the children in this family to take part in after-school activities or sports teams with their friends. There is simply not enough money left in the family budget. Since when did joining a local sports team become a luxury expense? These parents want nothing more than the best for their children but said that there are times when they wonder if working hard to pay off a mortgage and refusing to depend on government handouts is the right thing to do. They want their children to have a bright future but are struggling to stay on top of the bills and keep food on the table because of the rising cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is obvious to me that, since this Labor government began its wasteful spending, new taxes and broken promises, the quality of life of many people in my electorate has diminished. Labor's carbon tax only adds insult to injury for household budgets that are already under pressure. The carbon tax was met with great contempt by the people of Macarthur. The increased cost for small businesses and the rise in electricity prices for local residents mean they are struggling to make ends meet. I have shaken the freezing-cold hands of pensioners in their homes, where they are too scared to turn on their heaters because of their fear of rising electricity prices. One lady told me she has cut back to eating one meal a day and showering every second day because she is fearful of her rising electricity bills—fear, insecurity and instability all caused by this reckless government. The message I am hearing in Macarthur is very clear: families and small businesses are desperate for a government they can have confidence in . Families are struggling with the rising cost of living, and businesses are closing down under the uncertainty of this Labor government. The two most frequent issues raised with me by residents in Macarthur have been the rising cost of living and this government's debt. The decent, hardworking people in my electorate are really doing it tough, and the government is not paying attention.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are they struggling with the cost-of-living pressures, but they also see no relief in this week's budget from a government that has lost touch with everyday Australians. On Tuesday night Macarthur residents were let down by another bad budget. Labor have delivered a fifth record deficit in five years, yet they claim they will return the budget to surplus in three years. How can you trust them? The people of Macarthur and the people of Australia are not easily fooled. They have been let down too many times before and see that this Labor government have no credible path back to surplus. Revenue in 2013-14 is projected to be $80 billion higher than at the end of the Howard government. Yet with this budget spending in 2013-14 will be $120 billion higher than it was at the end of the Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past five years the government has spent $192 billion more than it has raised. Expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been higher every year under a Labor government compared with the last years of the Howard government. Labor's interest payments are now at almost $20 million a day. The budget delivers more than $25 billion in higher taxes over the next four years. To rub salt into the wounds of all Australians, this budget includes an extra $100 million in spending on government advertising. How can this government justify the $100 million on advertising when pensioners in my electorate cannot afford to heat their homes or have a shower every day?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week's budget has certainly failed to address the rising cost of living. In fact, it has only made it worse. Families will be worse off with the government's announcement to extend the pause on the income thresholds for family payments and the family tax benefit supplement payments until 2017. This decision will impact upon 1.5 million families who receive family tax benefit part A and 1.3 million families who received family tax benefit part B, as these supplement payments fail to keep pace with the rising cost of living. The Labor government's decision to scrap these planned family tax benefits will impact upon 12,261 families in Macarthur. This benefit would have provided up to $300 to eligible families with one child and up to $600 for families with two or more children. What happened to the government's promise to spread the benefits of the boom? It is just another broken promise and other let down for the people of Macarthur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also made promises on company tax for businesses at the last election and then took them away last year, saying the money would go towards family payments instead. Now those family payments have been taken away before they were meant to start. Families across the country are literally paying the price of this government's reckless spending and waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you now that more than 12,000 Macarthur families have taken a clear message away from this decision: Labor cannot be trusted to keep its promises nor honour its word. Labor promised no carbon tax, a budget surplus, 500,000 new jobs and increased family payments. Every one of these promises has been broken. The people of Macarthur deserve a government that sticks to its word. They deserve a government that will focus on sensible economic management, with a strong plan to pay back the debt and return to balanced budgets. Labor's latest attacks on family support payments and household budgets have come at a time when families can least afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Macarthur families will also suffer as a result of this budget's broken promise on child care. At a time when childcare costs are increasing, Labor has broken its promise that the indexation of the childcare rebate would recommence in 2014. Another broken promise. The increase to the Medicare levy will also mean that the average Australian family earning $70,000 will be $350 a year worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Record debt and rising costs of living for Australian families are also the result of a long list of incompetent polices that this government has blundered in its short time in office: the border protection fiasco, pink batts, set-top boxes and the BER school halls debacle. They raised 'cash for clunkers' and dropped it like a hot potato. Then there is the carbon tax promise. All of these failed policies have come at a huge cost to taxpayers across Australia and have contributed to the massive debt we find ourselves in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just families and businesses that are struggling with the rising cost of living. Charities in my electorate are also feeling the pinch. Charities and not-for-profit agencies have to spend much of their hard-earned money on rising bills rather than on those doing it tough in the community. In this country we now have an urgent need for a government that is focused on the needs of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here today as a proud member of the coalition, because I know that a stable and secure coalition government will help the people of Macarthur. The first thing we will do is get rid of the carbon tax. We will reduce regulation by $1 billion. We will cut back on government waste and mismanagement. We will introduce new economic policies that will ensure a stable and well-run economy. The coalition has the experience and the discipline to return a budget to sustainable surpluses, reduce debt and provide real support for Macarthur families to help them get ahead again. A coalition government would give businesses in Macarthur the certainty they need to prosper. We will create stronger jobs growth by building a diverse, world-class, five-pillar economy and we will generate one million new jobs over the next five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My hope for the sake of my children and future grandchildren is that this country will never again be in the financial mess that it is in now. The people of Australia and the people of Macarthur deserve better. They deserve a government that will reduce the cost of living by bringing the budget to sustainable surpluses and reducing the debt. They deserve the right to be excited about the future of our country and the future of their families. After six years of chaos, debt and spin the people of Macarthur are desperately seeking stable and competent economic management. A coalition government will build a strong, prosperous economy, a safe and secure Australia and restore the hope, rewards and opportunity that the people of Macarthur deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  by leave—I would like to inform the House of progress with preparations for the centenary of the First World War—the 'Anzac Centenary'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to report that Australia is well placed for the Anzac Centenary. The Centenary will be one of the most significant commemorative events in our history. Central to this will, of course, be the dawn service in Gallipoli, in 2015. Another key event will be the Armistice Day, in 2018. And, of course, there will be many important dates to commemorate over the four-year centenary period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is confident that the programs and initiatives identified so far will ensure that our nation will be able to proudly acknowledge the service of all servicemen and women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the bipartisan approach taken by the opposition in regard to the Anzac Centenary. The government and the opposition, and all other members of parliament, recognise the significance of the Centenary for the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 4 August 2014—some 15 months away now—worldwide commemorations marking the centenary of the First World War will start.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australia, the Great War was tragic, profound and transformational. From a nation of some four to five million people at the time, over 400,000 Australians volunteered and more than 330,000 served overseas. More than 60,000 never came home. Alongside the carnage and the suffering, we were witness to courage, tenacity, resilience and mateship—values that helped shape a young nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Anzac Centenary, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to honour the service and sacrifice of those Australians who permanently linked these values and qualities with the name, 'Anzac'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Planning by the government for the Anzac Centenary began on Anzac Day 2010 with the establishment of the National Commission on the Commemoration of the Anzac Centenary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission—led by former prime ministers the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser PC, AC, CH and the Hon. Bob Hawke AC—reported to government in March 2011 and recommended the establishment of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board to carry the baton forward by developing a blueprint for a program of Anzac Centenary initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its establishment in October 2011, the board has provided regular advice to the government on the development of a blueprint for the Anzac Centenary Program. The board has also undertaken extensive consultation with the states and territories and local communities. On 21 April 2013, the government released the board's report on a program of initiatives to commemorate the Anzac Centenary. The board report put forward 25 recommendations, all of which the government was pleased to accept.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the board and its chair, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AC, AFC (Ret'd) for their excellent, well-considered document. This report will be fundamental to shaping how we see the Anzac centenary and how we commemorate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn now to the details of the proposed Anzac Centenary Program. The centenary will be a time when we commemorate a century, or more, of service and sacrifice by Australian service men and women in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australia has participated, and continues to participate. It will be a time when we will honour generations of Australia's service men and women, past and present, and when we will see the continuity and the strength of the ANZAC inheritance. It is very much with us today, and will be with us into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In delivering the report to government, Air Chief Marshal Houston noted that unfortunately we live in a world that is far from peaceful and Australian servicemen and service women will continue to face dangers. Learning from the experience of Australians at war, and their families, over the last century or more remains vitally important and relevant today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national flagship initiative for the centenary will be a travelling exhibition. This will be an exhibition unlike anything most Australians have seen before. The government is determined that it will bring the Anzac centenary to rural, regional and urban communities across the country. It is intended that the travelling exhibition will immerse participants in simulations of the sights, sounds and objects of the major battlefields in which Australians fought. The exhibition will travel throughout Australia during the centenary period, potentially meeting 85 per cent of the population. The government has provided $10 million in seed funding for the travelling exhibition to ensure its planning can proceed. I am confident that the private sector will wish to contribute substantially to bring this initiative to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community participation will be the main way we ensure the Anzac legacy is passed to the next generation. This is one of the main aims of the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program which the government announced in early 2013. The program will provide $100,000 to each of Australia's 150 federal electorates, from 01 July 2013, to support communities commemorating the centenary in ways of their own choosing. Community involvement in developing projects to be considered for funding is already well underway. I encourage honourable members to work with their communities to generate ideas and make the most of this initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another iconic project is the protection and preservation of the Australian submarine HMAS<span style="font-style:italic;"> AE2</span>. Many Australians are probably unaware that the largest Australian relic from the Gallipoli campaign was not located until 1998 and lies, where it sank, at the bottom of the Sea of Marmara in present-day Turkey. It was scuttled by its crew after being struck by fire from an Ottoman torpedo boat. Its role and fate are not well understood. This vessel is at risk of damage and deterioration. The funding provided to the centenary program will enable a sound level of the protection and preservation to be undertaken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An educational campaign aimed especially at schoolchildren will also be funded. The government is also providing initial funding to the ABC to develop, in conjunction with Screen Australia, 10 hours of programs using a range of stories and storytelling devices to raise awareness of the Anzac centenary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding is also being provided to make The Australians at War Film Archive accessible to all Australians. This archive consists of interviews with over 2,000 Australians who participated in wars and peacekeeping operations in which Australia has been involved since the First World War, covering the battlefield and the home front. We will ensure that the entire archive is digitised and preserved so that it will be easily accessible, including for educational research purposes. We will also develop the minimum 100 personal stories for broadcast during the centenary using this extraordinary archive. These stories will blend human interest with a broad sweep of history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also agreed to fund the National Archives of Australia to digitise a sample of the repatriation records of those servicemen and service women who survived both Gallipoli and the Western Front. These Australians fought in some of the most atrocious battles of the war and had then to re-engage in civilian life, often carrying physical, emotional and mental wounds. This project will assist new research and I am sure will be of considerable interest to the families and descendants of those individuals who were repatriated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recognition of the importance of the education and research throughout the centenary period, we will establish a history grants program for research related to the Anzac centenary. This will not only contribute to the academic research but also be open to community and family-based research. We have also committed funding to ensure we properly commemorate the role of Albany in Western Australia as a departure point for the first convoys to Egypt and Gallipoli. The Australian government has already provided over $6.5 million for the development of a physical and online ANZAC interpretive centre at Albany. Now the government will provide $2.7 million toward an event to commemorate the gathering and departure of the first convoy from Albany that occurred on 1 November 1914. This funding will be in addition to the contribution to the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and possibly vessels from New Zealand and other navies to the commemoration. The event is intended to be a curtain-raiser for the Anzac Centenary Program and will be broadcast nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Anzac Centenary is a time to honour our Australian servicemen and women, past and present, it should also be a time to look broadly and honestly at Australia's military experience. This means recognising where facets of service and sacrifice have been underplayed in the past, and working to remedy the situation. The key role that Australian troops played on the Western Front throughout WWI has often been overshadowed by the events at Gallipoli. Australian troops in Europe played a crucial role in the eventual defeat of the Central Powers—and paid a terrible price for doing so. Over 75 per cent of Australia's war dead from the First World War died on the Western Front. Furthermore, we cannot forget the tragedy in the months and years that followed, when thousands of Australian troops died here at home from their wounds, putting the actual toll closer to double the number who died during the conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key ways we are recognising our relationship with the Western Front is the Australian Remembrance Trail. The trail was initiated by my predecessor, the Hon. Alan Griffin, and is being developed in partnership with local authorities in France and Belgium. This is an excellent initiative. The Australian government is contributing $10 million towards the trail, which will link the sites of the most significant Australian battles along the Western Front. Considerable progress has already been made across the various locations. It will build upon the efforts of local communities to commemorate Australian service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project highlights the collaborative approach we have taken to working with our international counterparts in commemorating the First World War. The government has forged strong relationships with the governments of Belgium, France and the United Kingdom in planning for the events that will mark the 2014-2018 period in Europe. In April, I met with my French and UK counterparts and signed a MOU with French minister Kader Arif that will provide a framework for Australia's participation in commemorations in France. This mirrors the MOU I signed with the Belgian government last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has now made a number of funding commitments to the Anzac Centenary. These include $83.5 million in the 2012-13 budget, notably $27 million for the refurbishment of the Australian War Memorial's First World War galleries and refurbishment of war graves. The government has committed a further $25 million in this year's budget. Our total commitment to the centenary program is now in excess of $140 million for a diverse range of projects and initiatives. This is a substantial commitment. To supplement this commitment, we will establish an Anzac centenary public fund to collect corporate donations. I commend the significant role being played by Mr Lindsay Fox in encouraging corporate donations. I call on corporate Australia to contribute to the fund and participate in this unique commemoration to help leave an enduring legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much to be done to implement the Anzac Centenary Program but the government is well advanced. States and territories are also progressing their initiatives, as are local communities with their involvement. Members of parliament will start submitting their Anzac Centenary local grant applications at the end of this month. I welcome the continuing role of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board as ambassadors, informing the community about the program of Anzac Centenary events and assisting in the successful delivery of the program by providing strategic advice to government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the focus of the Anzac Centenary will be on domestic activities, the desire of Australians to participate in commemorations marking the centenary of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli is great. The initial landings by the Anzacs occurred just before dawn on 25 April 1915, when Australians came ashore and engaged the Turkish defenders on the ridges inland. By the end of the day, more than 20,000 Australians and New Zealanders had been put ashore, mainly in a small bay to the south of Ari Burnu that soon became known as Anzac Cove. More than 2,000 Australians were killed during the first day and it has been estimated the opposing Turkish units suffered around the same number of casualties. During the eight-month campaign our men fought bravely, with many paying the ultimate sacrifice in the numerous battles including Krithia at Cape Helles, as well as in the August offensive battles at Lone Pine and the Nek.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the Gallipoli campaign will forever be remembered in our history as a tragic event resulting in the great loss, often needlessly, of young lives, we should also recall the successful evacuation that occurred without the loss of a single life. We will always remember the more than 50,000 Australians and 8,500 New Zealanders who served at Gallipoli. By the end of that Gallipoli campaign, 8,709 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders had died, with thousands more casualties. It is also important that we as a nation acknowledge the extensive loss of life suffered by the Turkish people throughout the Gallipoli campaign. More than 56,000 Turkish soldiers were killed, some 107,000 were wounded and another 11,000 were taken prisoner during the Gallipoli campaign. We should never forget that the Anzacs and the Turks held each other in quite high regard during those eight months. Over the years, that high regard has turned to friendship, camaraderie and mateship between our peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015 the Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli will follow the same program as in any other year. We rely very much on the support and cooperation of the Turkish authorities and we should never underestimate the extent of their commitment to this event each year. For example, they ensure the security of the site, coordinate access to the peninsula and provide health services for foreign visitors. The Anzac commemorative site, where the dawn service is held, is located in the Gallipoli historical national park—a rugged and remote part of Turkey. The site is surrounded by thick scrub, steep terrain and bounded by the Aegean Sea. It is subject to heritage and conservation restrictions and is extremely constrained and there is no opportunity for expansion. To ensure the safety of visitors, extensive investigations of the Anzac commemorative site have been conducted. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January this year, the Turkish government confirmed that the maximum number of attendees for the Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli in 2015 is 10,500 people. This was reaffirmed to me in April this year, after the Anzac ceremonies, during meetings with Dr Ismet Yilmaz, the Turkish Minister for National Defence, and Dr Ibrahim Kalin, Deputy Undersecretary of State and Foreign Advisor to the Prime Minister, and also with the Governor of Canakkale, Gungor Tuna.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government, of course, wants to see as many Australians as possible having the opportunity to attend the Dawn Service. However, we need to ensure that the service is solemn, dignified and safe for all those that attend. On that basis, we have agreed with the government of New Zealand that 8,000 places of the 10,500 places will be available to Australians and 2,000 places will be available to New Zealanders. This distribution is based on the relative number of casualties suffered by Australia and New Zealand during the campaign.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September last year, the Australian and New Zealand governments announced that a ballot would be held to allocate attendance passes to people wishing to attend the Anzac Day centenary commemorations at Gallipoli. A ballot is seen as the most fair, equitable and transparent process for allocating attendance passes to this significant occasion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public forums were held in 36 locations across Australia to discuss what we should do about the Centenary of Anzac. We had a website which was used for those people who wished to make online comments. The views of Australians have helped inform the government's decisions on the ballot process. It was also clear from the feedback that many people believe priority should be given to the sons and daughters of Gallipoli veterans and other direct descendants.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Attending the annual Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli in any year is a truly moving and unique experience for any Australian. Visiting Gallipoli around Anzac Day in 2015 will be the busiest and most difficult time to explore the area. Australians are encouraged to consider visiting Gallipoli throughout the year, which would allow for easier access to the battlefields and cemeteries and provide greater opportunities for personal reflection.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should never be forgotten that we Australians are invited to Gallipoli each year to commemorate Anzac Day, thanks again to the people of Turkey. It is by the goodwill of the government and the people of Turkey that so many Australians are welcomed so warmly each year. I would like to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the Australian people, the Turkish authorities and people who help us to stage the Anzac Day services. For example, the Gendarma, the 2nd Army Corps and the Straits Commander do an exemplary job in managing the safety and security of thousands of people who gather each year. I think we also owe a great deal of thanks to the people of the Canakkale region and the Governor of Canakkale, Gungor Tuna, and his predecessors for their support and goodwill.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are incredibly fortunate to have the friendship of the Turkish people. Each year around Anzac Day, we proudly remember that from those days of war, almost a century ago, a friendship has grown strong. On behalf of the Australian government, I wish to extend Australia's appreciation to the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the ongoing cooperation and support provided and for allowing us to hold commemorations on a yearly basis on Turkish soil. Our long-standing relationship and combined dedication to preserving and protecting the Gallipoli battlefields is paramount to the commemoration of the service of our forebears.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I rise to respond to the ministerial statement today on behalf of the shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs and shadow minister assisting the Leader of the Opposition on the Centenary of Anzac, Senator the Hon. Michael Ronaldson. It has been more than 18 months since the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of Anzac gave this chamber and the Australian people an update on the Centenary of Anzac. It is a fact, indeed a regrettable one, that the community has been preparing for the Centenary of Anzac in a vacuum, a vacuum devoid of ministerial leadership. So bad has been the government's stewardship of the Centenary of Anzac that Senator Ronaldson was forced to deliver a shadow ministerial statement calling for the government to take action and show leadership. That was in November last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At that time, Senator Ronaldson said this in relation to Minister Snowdon's silence on the Centenary of Anzac and the lack of leadership being shown:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Journalist Patrick Carlyon was, I suspect, far too close to the truth when he wrote:</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;"> Affairs Minister Warren Snowdon has adopted a literal approach to the Gallipoli story.  He has conjured a shambles.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This Government's apparent agenda for the Centenary of ANZAC appears to be an excessive outsourcing of decisions and responsibility to a paid Board whose reported activities, to date, give the impression that its size is making it incapable of actually making those decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister's refusal to make a statement to Parliament outlining the Government’s agenda, the decisions which have been taken or the considerations, if any, which are limiting the options available to the Government on the commemoration, is concerning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If we are to make this commemoration a success through community engagement, if we are to leave a lasting legacy for future generations, then it is incumbent upon this Government to be open, honest and upfront about what we should expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, seven months on, the government has chosen to respond to Senator Ronaldson's shadow ministerial statement. Not a moment too soon, Minister—but why so long?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is right when he says the coalition from day one has offered bipartisan support for the Centenary of Anzac; however he also knows that this not a blank cheque. He knows that the government has been stretching this goodwill. Our goodwill, and that of the community, is being sorely tested by this government and their approach to the centenary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, 25 April is a day for solemn reflection, remembrance and commemoration. It is not about celebration, but of commemoration for the service and sacrifice of those who have come before us and given their lives in defence of our freedoms and way of life. 25 April 2015 will perhaps be this nation's most important day of national commemoration. It will mark the 100th anniversary of the arrival of thousands of brave young men from Australia and New Zealand on a foreign beach as part of the so-called 'war to end all wars'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Conceived as a swift battle to overcome the Turks and seize the Dardanelles for the Allies, the ensuing eight-month campaign took more than 8,000 Australian lives and many more were wounded. Many of those who survived Gallipoli then went to fight on the Western Front, where three-quarters of our World War I dead remain today. This bloody conflict, which cost in excess of 60,000 lives, scarred a nation for a generation. Not one community in this nation was left unaffected. Families were left without sons and brothers, wives left without husbands. Children were left without fathers, and those who did return did so as changed men. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These men and their families built what is today regarded as the world's best repatriation system. As a nation we vowed to honour the service and sacrifice of our veterans and we vowed to never forget their service. The Centenary of Anzac gives this nation an important opportunity to ensure the legacy of Anzac continues. It will be about ensuring future generations understand what we fought for, where we fought and why we fought for it. It will be about rededicating ourselves to not repeat the mistakes of the past, such as the shameful way our Vietnam veterans were treated on their return from service in our nation's name. It is about honouring, it is about ensuring we uphold the unique nature of military service and honouring the obligations this nation has to those who served.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's chaos and general division and dysfunction have, regrettably, extended to the Centenary of Anzac. Despite repeated calls from the community and the coalition to show leadership on the Centenary of Anzac, Labor has been found wanting and the community has been left in limbo because of their silence. Last November, Senator Ronaldson stated in the Senate:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that leadership on the centenary of Anzac from this government and the minister is lacking. While I do not accept the view of some that Minister Snowdon appears totally disinterested, I do strongly urge him to take the ministerial ownership that is required and to take control of a situation that is short on time and long on expectation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's ministerial statement does not achieve this in and of itself. It requires ongoing engagement on the issues facing the community to ensure the Centenary of Anzac is the success it must be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister says that the government announced its ballot arrangements in September last year. This is despite newspapers reporting the details as early as June. They then spent close to $400,000 on so-called 'consultation' about how the ballot would operate. This was on top of $600,000 in other consultant fees into things such as the Centenary of Anzac logo and community perceptions of Anzac Day and 'why' we commemorate it! The veteran and ex-service community remains particularly angry at the government's spend on consultants for the Centenary of Anzac. They are also angry that the so-called ballot consultation 'road-show' was such an expensive exercise in spin which delivered little by way of substance. Regrettably, this has been this government's hallmark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Ronaldson noted in his shadow ministerial statement last year, one forum in Sydney cost in excess of $15,000 and there were just 15 attendees including three DVA staff and two paid consultants. At more than half of the forums, which were held at the odd time of 6pm, fewer than 10 people were in attendance. One forum had one attendee, another just one couple. That there would be a ballot was a foregone conclusion. It begs the question: just what did this all achieve?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After announcing a cap of 10,500 people for the dawn service on 25 April 2015, the minister sat on a consultant's report confirming this figure for nearly two years. The coalition has been forced to seek this document through freedom of information. In the absence of this report, the coalition and the community have only been able to take on face value the figures quoted by the government and their reasons for limiting capacity to this number. It does beg the question: why did the government not release this report earlier—what were they seeking to hide? In due course the community will come to understand why the government did not release this report earlier and why it was delivered under the cover of darkness to Senator Ronaldson at 8:10pm last Tuesday, budget night, arguably, the busiest night in the nation's capital and certainly in Parliament House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The adoption of the Local Grants Program model from the highly successful Australia Remembers program pioneered by former Labor veterans' affairs minister, Con Sciacca, is welcomed. That it took so long for Labor to confirm this and the guidelines which govern it, is of course a concern, but hardly surprising given their track record. The Australia Remembers program was hugely successful because it was driven from the ground up. It engaged local communities in the process of commemoration. This Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program will operate over the next financial year and will provide $100,000 per electorate. To assist members in allocating funds, committees will be established in each electorate to assist with decisions about projects to be supported. These grants are not just for the veteran and ex-service community. Schools, service organisations, church groups and others who wish to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac can apply for funds against the established funding criteria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's announcement of seed funding of $10 million for an interactive travelling exhibition to ensure commemoration is national is welcome. We note that the project will require the financial support of the private sector and that Lindsay Fox is very generously giving his time to seek high-level corporate fundraising support for the centenary. There will, of course, be many calls for funds for projects associated with the centenary and the government has indicated that the first priority is this travelling exhibition. We know that there is a long list of projects seeking funding, a list which the government has not yet released publicly. Whilst the exact details of the proposed travelling exhibition have not been released, we do understand that two 12-metre-long interactive panels transported on the back of trucks will move around Australia to assist with education and understanding of the Centenary of Anzac and the stories associated with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister assisting the Leader of the Opposition on the Centenary of Anzac, Senator Ronaldson, has outlined that, if elected to government, the coalition will take a much-needed hands-on approach to the management of the Centenary of Anzac. We will be upfront with the Australian people and ensure that all Australians, no matter where they live, will be able to participate in the Centenary of Anzac in their own way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the four months remaining until the election, we call on the government to finally show leadership on the Centenary of Anzac. We urge the minister to do as Labor minister Con Sciacca did and personally drive the Centenary of Anzac program. In finalising my comments on behalf of Senator Ronaldson, can I again confirm the coalition's full, bipartisan support for the Centenary of Anzac program.</span>

                    </a>  I respond to the minister's interjection by simply saying this: this minister let this bill sit unattended to for absolute months. If it was not for the coalition hounding the government to bring it back into this place, who knows if it would have even come back this month. Last time the government had the opportunity to consider this matter in the Senate they thought it was more important to deal with their gag media laws. As a result, it sat by the wayside. What this has demonstrated to me is that there are many failings of this government when it comes to border protection but the one they are becoming most guilty of now is their lack of any sense of urgency on this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter had full bipartisan support and it went nowhere for months and months and months, demonstrating the situation with regard to policy issues. The government likes to make all sorts of claims about the coalition's position on this. There is one outstanding matter, and that relates to the Malaysia people swap. But, as the minister full well knows, not even that matter is in a position where it could be considered by the parliament because he has not proceeded with it at all in terms of the recommendations of the Houston panel to put more effective protections in place. That policy remains red-lighted by the Houston panel. As a result, all the other matters in that report, to my understanding, are being progressed and, finally, this one has been progressed here this afternoon. It would not have been progressed were it not for the coalition's sense of urgency on this matter and forcing the government's hand to get this matter dealt with today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the bill coming back into this place. The coalition are happy to accept the amendments, as we did in the Senate. When this bill finally receives royal assent we would hope there would then be a deterrent for people seeking to target the mainland, as they have been doing while this government has again sat on its hands and sought to blame the opposition for its own border failures. The $10 billion blow-out, the record levels of arrivals—more than 2,000 per month—fit squarely and surely on the shoulders of this government's failed border policies. If you want a sense of this government's lack of urgency, then just look at the passage of this bill while it is dragging its feet once again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That can change at the next election, because the coalition will bring a sense of urgency to this matter that it has been demanding for absolute years. That will be an opportunity for the Australian people to settle this matter once and for all. My hope would be, if we were elected later this year, that never again would a government abolish measures that worked. In this area, this government abolished the measures that worked. The cost and chaos and tragedy that has followed sit fairly and squarely on the shoulders of this government. We are pleased, as we always have been, to support the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAASE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I rise today to speak to the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better Bill) 2013, just one of the five bills that make up the suite of bills, which this government has put forward in their attempt to address our aging population. There is a saying: old age is a privilege granted to few. A few Australians has grown to many, and this government needs to take care of our aging society in a manner that provides care with dignity, care with respect and, perhaps most importantly, care that is affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have endured five years of this government—five years of reform promises—and still there is very little evidence of real change on the ground. During the 2010 election Julia Gillard said aged-care reform would be a second-term priority. I do not expect anyone to be too surprised that very little has been achieved in the aged-care sector by this government. After all,    during the 2010 election campaign the current Prime Minister had to defend herself against claims she had not supported big increases to the age pension because, 'old people never vote for us.' Although the Prime Minister denied she had said 'old people never vote for us', she did admit to questioning the size of the pension rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who knows what the Prime Minister really said—not you, not I—but I do know that the Prime Minister has been caught out fibbing on many occasions, perhaps the most memorable being: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' As the saying goes, a leopard does not change its spots.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen this government undertake a litany of reports and reviews—reports and reviews which were either ignored or responded to with more inquiries. As this government sits on their hands making no decisions to secure aged care into the future, they are neglecting the very people who made this great country what it is today. I wonder if there is something they are not telling us. Are they perhaps on the verge of announcing a miracle anti-ageing pill? That announcement would be the only saving grace for the deplorable behaviour shown by this Prime Minister in her treatment of the elderly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only last week that I was approached by a constituent asking why prisoners were treated better than the elderly. The gentleman claimed the prisoners received three square meals a day, had education and rehabilitation classes provided and enjoyed gym equipment and claimed that some had access to television and the internet. Whether these claims are true or not is irrelevant. Public perception is what counts here and, if the people think Julia Gillard and her cronies treat prisoners better than our elderly. 'Where there is smoke there is fire' I say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care sector in Australia is in crisis, and at a time when there is increasing demand for services, providers are walking away from the sector due to the lack of viability of providing high-care beds and the increasing compliance demands of the government. It has been reported that up to 60 per cent of aged-care facilities are operating in the red and providers are handing back licences, causing senior Australians to wait longer or travel further to find a bed, thereby placing extra pressure on the public hospital system and on their families, not to mention the emotional pressure they suffer being displaced from family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, the coalition, have been advised that aged-care nurses spend, on average, a third of their time on paperwork. Under this package, things are only going to get worse as one of the great failures of this suite of bills is the missed opportunity to reduce red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older, and this is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and to 20 per cent—around 5.7 million people—in 2051. With fewer people generating taxation revenue, care options of concessional and assisted aged care residents, those with the least resources, will be jeopardised. Consequently, social structures will be eroded and services we have taken for granted will no longer be a given. The Australia we know will no longer be if we allow this Labor government to continue on their path of destruction. If we allow them to bypass proper structural reform of the sector, the care and wellbeing of senior Australians is at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, over one million older Australians receive aged-care services subsidised by the Australian government, and by 2050 over 3.5 million Australians are expected to use aged care each year. Over-85-year-olds, which are the main users of aged care services, will increase from 400,000—1.7 per cent of total population—in 2007 to 1.6 million—5.6 per cent of the population—by 2047. As you can see from the figures I have just quoted, aged-care requirements are only going to grow, and the problems we have now are going to be compounded if we do not implement a sound structural basis for this sector to grow upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a population are far more transient than previous generations. Generally speaking, no longer do we have our parents or grandparents living with us, helping us to raise the children. No longer do we have built-in babysitters. Now most families have both parents working with little or no immediate family help. Rather, 'family' has become friends in a similar predicament. Children are deserting the farms and leaving the rural communities in search of better opportunities, leaving behind their aging parents. This is not a criticism of the younger generation; every generation is entitled to seek fame and fortune. It does, however, I believe, create a greater problem in the rural areas of Australia, Durack in particular because of its sheer remoteness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged care in rural and remote areas is, for the most, severely lacking. Take for example the Shire of Northampton, a shire in Durack located about 480 kilometres north of Perth covering an area of 13,738 square kilometres—a shire with no aged-care facility. The Shire of Northampton has commissioned an aged-care plan, and in it they have recognised the catchment area has experienced significant growth in the 85-plus population from 43 persons in 2006 to 64 persons in 2012. This growth will continue with an estimated 120 persons aged 85-plus by 2027—an increase of 98.5 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The urgency for a residential care facility to accommodate residents in the Shire of Northampton and adjacent areas is of the utmost importance due to the increase in the community's ageing population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a number of ageing people, the need to relocate to a residential care facility from the familiarity of the family home can cause unnecessary emotional and financial distress, but to also have to relocate to another town or city away from family and friends is devastating. Ageing in rural areas is a frightening thought for parents and their families alike. Many of us live thousands of kilometres from families, and the only contact with elderly relatives is by phone and email. So frightening are some of the potential scenarios in our rural, regional and remote areas that shires are increasingly employing consultants to provide accurate information regarding aged care in their areas. This proactive approach has been taken by several Durack shires, and I bring to the attention of the House the report conducted by Verso Consulting for Central East Aged Care Alliance--CEACA. This group is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…seeking to develop a holistic regional solution to allow ageing residents to remain in the region for as long as possible, within the context of Federal and State Government policy initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">CEACA is made up of 11 shires from the Central East Wheatbelt in Western Australia, these are Westonia, Yilgarn, Merredin, Wyalkatchem, Trayning, Nungarin, Bruce Rock, Mount Marshall, Kellerberrin, Mukinbudin and Koorda, as well as the Wheatbelt Development Commission and the wheatbelt group of Regional Development Australia. The report shows quite clearly the projected growth of the aged population in the CEACA area, and will require additional aged-care services and infrastructure to be developed to support the projected increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is believed that the 70-plus-year-old population will increase from 1,019—10.3 per cent of the total area population—in 2011 to 1,196, 11.5 per cent of the population, by 2017, and to 1,616, or 15.9 per cent of the population, by 2027. The report also found that in the CEACA local government areas, the portion of the population that is older is higher than state averages and is projected to exceed the comparable state-wide figure by at least five percentage points in 2017, by 5.7 percentage points in 2022, and by 6.3 percentage points by 2027.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the consultation process for the report, 15 fora were conducted, with at least one forum held in each local government area participating in the development of the Central Eastern Wheatbelt Aged Care Solution. There was a common view that older people have to move away from the communities when their aged-care needs can no longer be met, and this contributes to the demise of communities. The fora showed that distance is more than kilometres, it is about reduced access to essential services. Some communities have limited access to pharmaceuticals, and there are older people who are disconnected from vital aged-care and health services, especially those on rural properties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges faced by older people attending specialist appointments are great, remembering that the majority of these appointments are in Perth, hundreds of kilometres away. The fora proved the overuse of volunteer arrangements and the underuse of shire-owned transport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report goes on to show the lack of services for people who have been in Perth hospitals and who are returning to the community, the consistently inadequate lack of information regarding services and the significant workforce shortages impacting on the capacity to deliver services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, the report shows there is a severe shortage of aged cared facilities in the region. I could go on, but I am sure you understand the gist of the report. The 11 shires that make up the Central East Aged Care Alliance are not orphans in their predicament in Western Australia. I imagine you could visit any of the 46 shires in my vast electorate of Durack and hear the same problems this group is facing. Ageing in any of the rural, regional or remote areas that make up Durack is a frightening thought. We do not have public transport that will take us to the specialist in the next suburb, we do not have super pharmacies at every street corner and we do not have enough beds to put the elderly in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Living Longer Living Better aged-care reform package was announced on 20 April 2012, and these five bills give effect to that package. It has taken the government a year to bring legislation to parliament and now it wants to ram these bills through without proper consideration. Such is the seriousness with which we, the coalition, consider aged care, that we referred these bills to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee to examine the full impact of how these changes would affect providers, older Australians, their families and carers. A majority of Labor and Greens senators have voted to bring forward the reporting date of the Senate Community Affairs Committee on the five Living Longer Living Better package of bills from 17 June 2013 to 31 May 2013. We, on this side of the House, opposed this change of reporting date, because of the reduced time it affords for consideration of the legislation, and in particular because of important regulatory instruments that will affect the operation of the reforms would not be available for consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions received were quite critical of the government, primarily over the key issues of workforce, financing, bonds and information access. The inquiry heard evidence that facilities with 60 beds or fewer would be worse off financially and may be forced to close or amalgamate. The inquiry raised many issues about the complexity in the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that most of the provisions do not come into force until 1 July 2014, I question the haste to get these bills through. The provisions which come into force on 1 July 2013 can be enacted by the government under existing delegated legislation, so once again the question is valid. These hurried bills are a sure sign of a government determined to make the impact of its dying days felt by all Australians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill and the related bills. Aged care is, of course, an issue that affects all of us. We may have parents or other older relatives and friends needing aged care either now or prospectively. We may ourselves be at a stage of life where we need such care, either in our own home or in an aged-care facility. All of us have an interest in living in a civilised nation where those who have worked and contributed, and after being young and active now come to a stage of their life where they need care, can get the care they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package of bills before the House today deals with a very important subject area. Unfortunately, as is so often the case with this government, the details of the measures in the bills before us do not live up to the soaring rhetoric which we have heard from this government about its plans in this policy area. In the time I have available to me this afternoon I want to make three points. Firstly, the changes contained in this package have a major impact in my electorate of Bradfield, where we have many fine aged-care facilities. Secondly, this bill is in essence a framework and much detail is left to regulation. That puts the parliament in the position of being asked to sign off on a set of policies when the details of those policies are not known. Thirdly, while there are very serious issues facing the aged-care sector, this package leaves most of those issues inadequately addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn firstly to the impact of this package on my electorate of Bradfield where there are many fine retirement villages and aged-care facilities and services. I will mention just a few that I have had the good fortune to visit in recent times: Fernbank Retirement Village in St Ives; Christophorus House retirement village in Hornsby; the BUPA retirement village in Roseville; KOPWA aged care in Roseville, which used to be the Ku-ring-gai Old People's Welfare Association, KOPWA, but it is now just called KOPWA; the Presbyterian Aged Care Northern Sydney Community Care Service; the Adventist Retirement Village in Normanhurst; the Southern Cross Residential Care Retirement Village in North Turramurra; and the Rohini retirement village in Turramurra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I regularly find myself very impressed by the quality of the facilities I visit: the caring staff, the cleanliness, the high physical standards in the facilities, the activities, the therapy and the outings available for residents. But achieving this outcome is not easy. I regularly hear from those who operate aged-care facilities in my electorate about the difficulties they are facing in maintaining the economic viability of those facilities. I also hear regularly from families, spouses and others who find themselves urgently looking around for a place in a suitable aged-care facility or nursing home for an elderly relative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government first announced its new approach to aged care, which today's package of legislation is supposed to give effect to, in April 2012. Once the Living Longer Living Better package was announced I started to very rapidly receive expressions of concern from those operating aged-care facilities in my electorate. It soon became clear that the immediate effect of the package was to reduce funding to many aged-care facilities. In fact, there was a total reduction of $1.6 billion in the aged-care funding instrument. I have received complaints that this occurred without a cost-of-care analysis being done. I received complaints about the fact that the government sought to achieve savings of $500 million from this instrument in one year, starting from 1 July 2012. And I received complaints, as have many others, that in the industry's view these changes created a two-class funding system, with a resident arriving in an aged-care facility after 1 July receiving less funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care funding instrument is essentially a formula, into which key parameters are inputted and therefore generates a figure per place in the relevant facility. What the government did at very short notice was to change the formula so that a given facility with a given number of places suddenly received a lower amount of funding. This occurred with very little notice in the middle of the 2012 calendar year. The changes were announced on 21 June and took effect from 1 July. The practical impact was that aged-care facilities, which had budgeted for their operations during the calendar year on a particular basis, now found that their in-year funding was unexpectedly reduced. In one relatively small facility in my electorate, for example, the CEO told me he budgeted on the assumption of indexation of 1.9 per cent, which would have generated an annual surplus of $12,000. But the impact of not having indexation when the funding instrument was suddenly changed was to change his result to a loss of $24,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of its broader impact, analysis conducted for the industry by accounting firm Grant Thornton found that these changes were likely to result in funding cuts of between eight and 15 per cent compared to the subsidies that would have applied using the funding instrument in its previous form. Grant Thornton also found that the cuts appeared to be weighed most heavily towards high-care and dementia facilities. So this change at very short notice had a very significant detrimental impact on the profitability of operators of aged-care facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn now to the proposition that this bill is lacking in key detail and comprises mainly a framework. Largely these bills set out broad principles with detailed rules left to be made by bureaucratic agencies or by the minister on advice from those agencies. For example, under proposed section 52G-4 the Aged Care Pricing Commissioner can approve certain higher prices, under proposed section 96-1 the minister will determine the fees and payment principles, under proposed section 52K-1 the secretary will determine cases of financial hardship and under proposed section 52M there are to be new prudential standards forming part of the fees and payment principles dealing with, for example, the way that approved providers must provide information about their financial management. The point is that these are all issues of great importance but the details will be left to be determined by bureaucrats, and the parliament is unable to assess the full impact of this package. There is, however, every reason to suspect that this is going to be a mechanism for even more detailed, expensive and burdensome regulatory oversight of a sector which is already very extensively overseen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn now to the third proposition I want to advance, which is that there are serious issues facing the aged-care sector but, unfortunately, this package, despite the soaring rhetoric from the Gillard government, leaves many of those serious issues unaddressed. The fundamental problem facing the aged-care sector is one of economic viability. It is estimated that only 40 per cent of residential aged-care providers are operating in the black, and that includes both for-profit and not-for-profit operations. The inevitable and unsurprising consequence is that the supply of aged-care places is severely constrained. Providers are in many cases handing back licences because it is simply not viable for them to operate. In each of the last three to four years of funding rounds, a proportion of allocated beds were not taken up or were handed back. In consequence, senior Australians are finding it harder to find a place in an aged-care facility. They need to wait longer or they need to travel further from their present home. It is curious that this is the case when the stated objective of the policy, which this package of legislation purportedly gives effect to, is to expand the number of aged-care places. Certainly based upon the feedback I have received from many operators of aged-care facilities in my electorate, there is very little reason to be confident that this package will achieve its stated objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the features of this legislative package which is conspicuous is the range of recommendations made in the Productivity Commission report which are not included in the legislation the government has put before the parliament. Labor has ignored the bulk of the Productivity Commission report; it has merely cherry-picked a few recommendations. Let me quote, for example, from a letter I received from the major aged-care provider BUPA, which has a number of facilities around Australia, including a facility at Roseville in my electorate, which I visited last year. BUPA had this to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In our view the Living Longer Living Better reform package ... largely ignored the Productivity Commission's recommendation for a personalised care entitlement system that would enable improved customer choice and flexibility. We believe our Older Australians and their families should be able to pick and choose where they receive their care. We therefore urge the Government to proceed with a single entitlement based funding system and to start this process of reform now; not 5 years hence as suggested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the government purportedly introducing a set of reforms designed to address the very serious problems facing the aged-care sector. We have a government purporting to do that in reliance on advice from the Productivity Commission. But those in the sector who have analysed the details of what the government has actually brought forward have pointed out that the measures do not address many of the fundamental problems which are faced by the industry and do not to a very large extent give effect to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. What we have seen, however, in this package, which is not at all surprising given the track record of this government, is the introduction of extensive new mechanisms for detailed bureaucratic regulatory oversight. We have seen the addition of new bureaucratic machinery, such as establishing the Aged Care Funding Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me quote from one local aged-care provider responding to the statement in the minister's press release of April last year that the new package would 'set stricter standards, with greater oversight of aged care'. He had this to say in a letter he wrote to me:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The aged care industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in Australia. The requirement to meet the 4 accreditation standards and 44 outcomes, with two annual audits and a major one each three years; and with numerous regulations and requirements at all levels, begs the question, why even more scrutiny? What is prompting these kinds of statements?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The frustration which is evident in that letter speaks volumes for the mismatch between the approach that this government has taken and what is likely to be required to solve the difficulties that we all agree are facing the aged-care sector, with a significant constraint on the availability of places in aged-care facilities where Australians of older years can go to receive the care that they rightfully expect and that we would all want them to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inept approach of this government on this complex issue stands in contrast to the clear principles which have been articulated by the coalition both at the previous election and in remarks made and policies laid down, principles articulated by the coalition spokesman in this area, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. We have made it clear that we have a very different approach. We intend to establish a four-year aged-care provider agreement with the intention of providing greater certainty over a longer period of time. Because what we on the coalition side of this parliament understand is that the crucial thing is to create an environment in which those who are operating aged-care facilities have the right incentives and right support to go out and do the good job they need to do to serve the interests of older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's performance in this area, regrettably, shows a gulf between reality and rhetoric. This is an important policy priority and, should we win government, it is one we will give clear attention to. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I certainly echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague and good friend the member for Bradfield in his speech to the House this afternoon. I rise today to also speak on the package of bills, including the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013, the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013, the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, the Aged Care (Bond Security) Amendment Bill 2013 and the Aged Care (Bond Security) Levy Amendment Bill 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In amongst the bickering and the quarrelling that sometimes take place in this House—and the somewhat more elevated debate—there is one thing that I am very confident that each and every member of this place can agree on. We can agree that we have a duty to ensure that senior Australians live their lives in security, with access to quality care, and to make sure that they have real choice in that care. Every Australian should understand and respect the service and dedication that previous generations have given to build this great nation. If not for the sacrifices of older Australians, we would not be in the position that we are in today. That is why we must do all that we can to provide for our older Australians to make sure they get the dignity and respect they deserve so that they may live out their retirement years in peace and security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, no matter how meaningful or profound those sentiments may be, it matters very little if the detailed plan is not in place to put those words into action, and that is where this government has failed so dramatically. It talked big, but its rhetoric does not match the reality. The government has been in power for coming on six years. The Treasurer has delivered his sixth and, hopefully, his last budget—I say this not out of arrogance or hubris but rather out of a very deeply held belief that Australia cannot afford another budget that delivers more debt, more deficits, more taxes, more spending promises and more uncertainty all round. Yet, despite this extended period in government and despite all of the talk, there has been very little advancement in the aged-care sector. If anything, there has actually been a regression. It has been reported that, despite increase in demand, only 40 per cent of residential aged-care providers operate at a profit, meaning more than half are unsustainable in the long term. This in turn has seen a number of providers handing back their licences, which in turn has put extra strain on the public system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A significant factor that is contributing to this decline in viability is the ever-increasing regulatory burden placed on aged-care providers. I find it somewhat ironic that this government has a minister for deregulation yet, in its time in government, has increased regulations by over 21,000 and repealed a tiny fraction of that. Many of these regulations apply to the aged-care sector. I can only imagine what it would have been like if there had been no minister for deregulation. The coalition has committed itself to a realistic reduction of red tape and regulation based on actions, not words. We have committed to cutting $1 billion of red tape and regulation. We will ensure that we keep the standards and safety levels but allow the aged-care sector to get on with doing what it should be doing: concentrating on looking after our senior Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of the crisis in the aged-care sector that the Productivity Commission were engaged to conduct their report <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians</span>, which was released by the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing on 8 August 2011. It then took this government 250 days to respond to the 58 recommendations in this report. With much fanfare, the government announced a moderate increase in funding and the Living Longer Living Better package of bills, which is the subject of this debate. As with all of the initiatives of this government, they managed to coin a creative name but it lacks substance and detail. It is the detail that always concerns us on this side of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we are concerned over the detail of this bill is that the government is trying to force through the bills in this House prior to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee completing their report. Already concerns have been expressed during the Senate inquiry—concerns that pertain to home care user co-payments, residential care pricing arrangements, rural and remote services, the homelessness supplement, the dementia supplement, the amendments to the bond security legislation, the pricing authority, faith-based sex discrimination, the Productivity Commission's approach as an alternative and, finally, the consultation processes as to how we are at this point today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, though, we are concerned that, under the Living Longer Living Better package, there will be cuts in the order of $1.6 billion to ACFI funding due to assertions made by this government that the system is being rorted. To date we have yet to understand specifically where those accusations are coming from and the substance and details of those assertions. It does sound somewhat similar to the assertions that were made more recently by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on 457 visas. He admitted that he made up some assertions and forecasts but said in his defence that everybody makes up forecasts, so why can't he? I suppose he was taking a lesson from our current Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These cuts will have a real and significant impact on aged-care providers. In a media statement released in 2012, Leading Age Services Australia, or LASA, stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Aged care providers face a revenue black hole of more than $750 million over the next two-and-a-half years …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also outlines research findings as follows: 89 per cent of aged-care facilities will face unrecoverable losses of revenue under the ACFI changes of 1 July; the average reduction of care funding for each affected resident each year is between $20,000 and $23,000; and the average loss per aged-care facility is more than $125,000 each year, with some facing revenue shortfalls of up to $560,000 and smaller and rural facilities potentially being the most affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also concerned that the Living Longer Living Better package will increase the regulatory burden rather than decrease it. These bills will establish the Aged Care Funding Authority, a new bureaucracy which will act outside the remit of parliamentary scrutiny and dictate prices, bonds and other measures. The justification for this super-regulator was once again predicated on some pretty spurious assertions—again, the claim of rorting through the issuance of superbonds of more than $2 million. Yet it is my understanding that only one person in Australia has a bond in excess of $2 million, and this is because highly specialised equipment was needed in that case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, most concerning to the coalition is the $1.2 billion workforce supplement, which will supplement the wages of some in the industry. To access this funding, providers with more than 50 beds will have to enter into EBAs and meet certain obligations in order to gain access to the government's supplement. The cuts to ACFI, followed by the introduction of this access measure, clearly indicate that the government only wants to reward those providers who have workers with union memberships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is quite wrong. It will not help our older Australians more broadly but will simply pander to special interest groups. This measure will force up the wage costs of all providers and, as I mentioned earlier, many are already operating at a significant loss. This particular concern was highlighted in a number of submissions made in reference to the package of bills. I read from some of those concerns that were expressed. Mr Ray Glickman on 29 April said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are four reasons why the workforce supplement should not go ahead. First of all, it is wrong in principle. To take away funds from ACFI, which essentially belong to our residents, and then transfer them to workers, is wrong in principle. And it is particularly wrong in an environment where consumer direction will be the future. Also it is futile, because robbing Peter to pay Paul does not generate more money in the system, sustainably, to pay higher wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure is secondly wrong because it industrialise what is essentially a funding issue. It centralises industrial arrangements and takes away the outcomes that one negotiates individually as an enterprise. It also seems designed to promote the interests of the union by driving clauses that have been rejected by many employers in their own enterprise bargaining arrangements. Many of the initiatives that had to be included are also costly and do not directly benefit residents, or clients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thirdly, it should be rejected because the proposition is not fully funded. So, in addition to recycling existing funds, so we have no more money, it does not cover on-costs. That includes numerous expensive expenditure items that will be part of the overall deal. Our calculation suggests that the cost will outweigh income by two to one. That seems extraordinary, but it is true once you add up all the elements. We have an example from the bush, where to gain $17,000 will cost $30,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fourth reason it should be rejected is that it is discriminatory. The majority of regional, remote and rural providers will not be able to comply with the requirements – and they are the organisations who are most in need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To summarise those points: this supplement is very poor piece of public policy. Let us not call it a compact, because it certainly has been agreed with provider organisations. It takes money from care to return to some employers who can strike a deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Marie-Louise MacDonald, a board director of Masonic Care Alliance, on 30 April said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The workforce subsidy … is a major concern. We as an organisation and all of our alliance have EBAs which pay above the awards. We all want to do well by our staff and in our own way we put in place a number of things around family friendly environments and rostering around those needs and such to retain our staff. We would love to give them more money as well. The problem is that subsidy is a shortfall for what we actually need. In WA an average worker would have six weeks annual leave – that is a carer. If they are a registered nurse or an enrolled nurse they can have seven weeks if they work a rotational shift, and if they were lucky enough to be moving from a state award into the federal they would get an extra week on top of that – so that is eight weeks. The accruals that relate to that workforce are substantial. Any subsidy that comes through has to recognise the flow on of the accrual cost that goes with that. For organisations like mine it can be millions of dollars that you have in accruals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this all so important? Why is it essential that we look after our senior Australians, those people who have raised our parents, who have in turn raised us? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that we get this right because we know our population is ageing. In fact, around nine per cent of the population is 70 years or older and this is expected to increase to 20 per cent by 2051. By the same year, 3.5 million Australians are expected to be using aged care, accounting for around three per cent of GDP. If we do not address this issue now it is going to be more difficult in the years ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A government that is so much in chaos—that perverts the proper course of government in a vain attempt to win the headline of the day and does not do its homework properly to address these real and critical issues facing our nation—is not a government that can be trusted. After six long years this government has still not realised the fundamental truth that good policy makes good government. If the government actually implements real change that improves the lives of people, not makes it more difficult, people will respect it. But this will not occur while it is simply chasing the media cycle and a headline and not doing the detailed policy work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the amendment before the House to defer these bills until proper scrutiny has been applied and we can see the full and complete report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. This issue is too important not to get right. It is too important not only to the senior Australians of today but for all of us who will become senior Australians in the future. We have a responsibility and we need to honour that responsibility.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Living Longer Living Better package of bills. It is fair that we would all like to live longer and better. Every single one of us desires to live a long healthy and prosperous life. As we age our needs change and it is important to be assured that we will be cared for and treated with dignity when we can no longer live on our own. The ageing of our population is one of the biggest social issues facing Australia. We are all living longer and have a rapidly ageing population as a consequence. Statistics show that approximately nine per cent of our population is aged 70 years or older and this is expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and to 20 per cent by 2051, which equates to 5.7 million people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this increase, there are a number of things we need to consider, including more complex health conditions and changing disease patterns resulting in increasing and changing aged-care needs. Almost 321,000 Australians are currently living with dementia, which is projected to increase to some 900,000 by 2050. Our culturally diverse population is growing. It is also worth considering the increase in dependency ratios. By 2047 we will be almost halved to 3.2 people of working age supporting every person aged over 67. As a consequence, there will be fewer people generating the tax revenue necessary to support our older Australians. Social structures will be eroded and things we have taken for granted will no longer be a given. As we head into a future with an increasingly ageing population, will our aged-care system be able to provide the care that all Australians expect?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, over one million older Australians receive aged-care services subsidised by the government. As I said earlier, by 2050 some 3.5 million Australians are expected to use aged-care services each year. It is fair to say that, for all Australians, quality aged care should be a priority. Even the Prime Minister herself, during the 2010 election, said that aged-care reform would be a second-term priority. But, despite this aspiration, we have seen very little evidence of real change on the ground. There are literally pages and pages of reviews and reports into the aged-care sector; some 20 reviews and three Productivity Commission reports. Despite all of this work, and all of the recommendations, no decisions were made to secure aged care into the future. After five years of Labor's neglect, the aged-care system urgently requires change to provide Australians with the certainty that their lives will actually be longer and better. This is an important issue for my constituents in the electorate of Forde. Australians, including the many aged-care providers, aged-care workers and residents, would like to see real action to get things done. Real action which, to this day, has been neglected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is worth just having a look at what this package of bills contains. The Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 is the main bill of the package. It includes changes relating to residential care, changes to establish a new type of care—home care—changes relating to governance and administration, and minor administrative and other consequential changes. We also have the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency Bill 2013, which establishes a new Australian Age Care Quality Agency as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act and replaces the existing Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency from 1 January 2014. We have the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, which replaces the existing Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency and allows for transfer of custody of records and documents and the transfer of office holders and staff. We have the Aged Care (Bond Security) Amendment Bill 2013, which amends the existing Aged Care (Bond Security) Act 2006 and changes its name. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills were referred to a Senate inquiry, and during this inquiry the Department of Health and Ageing disclosed that there were some 19 pieces of legislative instruments that will affect the operation of these five bills. Once again the government has failed to provide us with those instruments, making it extremely difficult to thoroughly assess before these bills are voted on. These bills are typical of the government's practice of enacting a framework legislation and leaving the bulk of the detail to delegated regulation, thereby expecting the parliament to vote on bills when the full impact is unknown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing to have to point out that, despite the government's promises of reform, many outstanding viability issues for providers still remain. Instead of releasing pressure on this sector, this government has cut $1.6 billion from the Aged Care Funding Instrument. In addition, within these bills, more uncertainly surrounds the establishment of the framework for the $1.2 billion workforce supplement. This could be quite costly for providers relying on cuts to ACFI, and looks suspiciously to be a political mechanism to unionise the sector. Stakeholders are also concerned about the establishment of the Aged Care Funding Authority. Furthermore, these five bills seek to add more pain and pressure to what is already a highly regulated industry, by adding even more red tape. Unsurprisingly, we see the government once again cherry picking only a few of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I speak to aged-care providers in the electorate of Forde, they tell me that red tape is one of their biggest issues, and we see this as a missed opportunity to reduce red tape in this industry. This is particularly relevant when I go and speak with organisations such as Seasons at Waterford West, The Lodge at Upper Coomera, Blue Care Wirunya Aged Care Facility and Connolly Court Hostel. These are some of the great aged-care service providers in our electorate. They all have that common story: red tape is strangling their ability to provide quality care for the residents in those facilities. As I mentioned in February this year when I spoke on this issue in the Federation Chamber, this is a sector that is absolutely buried beneath regulation and red tape. It is possibly one of the most regulated in our country. The coalition has been advised that aged care nurses spend on average a third of their time on paperwork. Under this package, that is only going to get worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition wants to see reform in partnership with the aged care sector. It does not believe that fundamental reform should be imposed from above. If successful at the next federal election, the coalition will immediately commence consultation with stakeholders in the aged care sector on a framework for the first ever four-year aged care provider agreement, including consideration of a broad range of the recommendations contained in the Productivity Commission report. We will honour our senior Australians by giving them the care that they need now and in the future, because of their valuable contribution to our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have support from the likes of the Campaign for Care of Older Australians, who said in response to our 2010 ageing policy: 'We commend the idea of a four-year industry agreement to focus on cutting red tape and addressing staff shortages as a plan to provide an effective and efficient system of care, and support older people's needs now and into the future.' We in the coalition will always support measures to assist the senior members of our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our agreement will deliver better and more affordable aged care by seeking to reduce red tape and enable nurses to get back to nursing and looking after residents, providing certainty for older Australians underpinned by a high-quality framework. It will deliver value for money through revised subsidy arrangements, ensuring certainty for the aged care workforce. It will establish a more flexible and viable aged care provider network to meet care needs now and into the future. It will ensure that the comfort and safety of older Australians are maximised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would like to see the agreement in place within a year of taking office. We will commence by establishing a high-level aged care provider agreement committee of key stakeholders to oversee the administration and implementation of the agreement and provide advice to the minister. We will also establish an aged care provider agreement working group, which will undertake the detailed design and project work required to give effect to the agreement, including taking account the recommendations of the Productivity Commission inquiry and other relevant reviews. Once again, it will be a coalition government that will seek to do more to reform the aged care sector in Australia, reduce regulation and red tape and provide a positive vision to ensure that older Australians in our community are properly cared for and looked after.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight on the Aged Care (Living Longer Living Better) Bill 2013 and cognate bills, which concern so many older Australians. I remember when these bills were foreshadowed in a number of reports some years ago. They were trumpeted loudly. So many in the industry, unfortunately, were prepared to stand with the government for the government's photo opportunity. Unfortunately, all were deceived, as what the reports of the past promised has not been delivered in these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, in 2010 the federal government engaged the Productivity Commission to look at the aged care system and their report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lder Australians</span>, was released on 8 August 2011 by the Prime Minister and Minister Butler. It was then around eight months later that the government responded with Living Longer, Living Better. As I understand it, there were 500 submissions to the Productivity Commission and another 500 in response to the draft. Despite this huge volume of submissions and responses, the government picked up fewer than 10 per cent of the recommendations. It really does say something, doesn't it, about the feeling or the concerns within the sector, that so many are prepared to make submissions regarding this important sector? It was, however, highly unfortunate, given that the Productivity Commission was well-supported by the sector—those who are involved in the day-to-day operations of the industry and know it best—that whilst the report was so well-received, so little of it came to fruition in this legislation before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To take up the realities of this government's failure in aged care, I begin by questioning the cut of $1.6 billion last year from the Aged Care Funding Instrument. As I understand it, that $1.6 billion was justified by the Gillard government on the grounds that there was widespread rorting by providers. There was a bit of media on that; the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> ran it. And despite allegations being made I have not actually heard of a single prosecution that has been made in the last five years. The ABC has, however, allowed the government to withdraw that money, yet amazingly the Workforce Compact was then introduced—funding to the tune of $1.2 billion supporting a union membership drive in aged care. So they take away from the sector and give it away to the advantage of the union movement. To me it looks more like shoring up support for the Prime Minister through the faceless men of the union leadership. Of course, Minister Butler also has links to one of the beneficiaries of the compact, that being United Voice. It is a win-win situation for the Prime Minister and the minister, because, as we know, those opposite are beholden to their pre-selectors—the union movement—and are increasingly paying back that support by using the tax dollars of every Australian to pay for that support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what has happened as a result of this so badly and falsely named Living Longer, Living Better Gillard government policy? The government should pat itself on the back for presiding over $3.5 billion in shelved aged care development projects! I am being facetious of course, because in August last year it was suggested by a peak aged-care body that over the following 2½ years the providers will face a black hole of $750 million and that only 40 per cent of providers are now even making a profit. The government should not congratulate itself for backing their union preselector mates and sending the industry into a crisis. It was on 5 March this year that the Workforce Compact was announced and required providers with 50 or more beds to enter into union agreements if they wanted access to a share of the $1.2 billion of the compact. Yet in reality many providers will be unable to pay these wage increases and ongoing costs such as administration and superannuation. Smaller providers in country and regional areas are the worst hit and are becoming even less viable due to this Labor government, yet it is also the case that providers operating in my electorate are struggling more and more. Given the low take-up of bed licences in Western Australia, you would have thought the government would acknowledge that there was actually a problem and at least try to put in place a solution to address that problem. But no: yet again, the Gillard government has made it worse by its 'we know better' attitude and response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should recall that back in 2007 Kevin Rudd campaigned on a new direction for frail and older Australians. However, just like the WA infrastructure fund, he failed to deliver it—just like this Gillard government has failed older Western Australians, preferring to back their union bosses at the cost of older people in Cowan and elsewhere. The providers in Cowan tell me that they are suffering and that their ability to provide services for the elderly is being reduced. Elderbloom, who operate in Wanneroo and in Kingsley, Bethanie in Warwick and Meath in Kingsley are all doing it tougher due to this government and its priority of their personal political careers over the interests of the aged and infirm in Cowan. It is of course not surprising that the Gillard government acts this way. As was leaked out of cabinet a few years ago, the now Prime Minister was against pension increases because 'older people never vote for us'. No wonder she redirects money out of the sector to the benefit of her union mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the efforts of one man in Ballajura, in the East of Cowan, who is trying to create an aged-care and independent living facility to meet the desperate needs of one of Perth's biggest suburbs. I speak of Councillor Mel Congerton of the City of Swan. A local in Ballajura, he has been working hard on meeting the needs of the people in the area. He has been working up plans, while the Labor councillors and the Labor MLA in the area periodically seek photo opportunities on the site without doing the real work that Mel does. As Mel tries to get this project up, the viability-sapping policies of increased costs and regulations—the Labor way—will make the challenge even harder. I wish Mel all the best and I will continue to back him strongly as we try to get Ballajura looked after, in spite of the obstacles Labor puts in the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, I will take this opportunity to speak about the challenges to the aged-care sector in Western Australia. I thank Steve Kobelke of Aged and Community Services WA, Ray Glickman of Amana Living and Beth Cameron of Leading Age Services WA for coming to see me about these bills. I also thank the local providers for letting me know their views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, from all these reports the best interests of my constituents are being undermined by this government. The industry has come to a standstill through the inaction of the Gillard government. I have been told of the stagnation in both development and provision of services. An example of the terrible situation is that there are now 3,500 bed licences that have not been taken up in Western Australia. The need remains strong, but the capacity of industry to take up the licences is just not there. They also tell me that this year, 2013, saw Western Australia allocated 80 in-home care packages out of 5,835 across Australia. Although the introduction of bonds for high care was appreciated, the sector is unhappy that so many of the Productivity Commission's recommendations were not taken up. The sector was hoping for a situation whereby consumers would have an entitlement to care, allowing providers to innovate to meet demand, all of which was to take place in a less regulated environment. I also understand that, currently, about a third of a nurse's shift in aged care is taken up with paperwork.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the matter of the workforce wages compact, the sector does not support taking money from care and channelling it into supplementing wages. This was never agreed to by the peak bodies, and those peak bodies know that no new funding was involved. It was just ripped out of care subsidies. The Western Australian providers tell me that 75 per cent of the increased wages still have to be paid by the providers, as well as putting in place new workplace conditions. They say that if they could they would pay more in wages, but this Labor government just imposed upon them a requirement to pay an additional 2.75 per cent in wage increases. I find it absolutely bizarre that this government can make it harder for providers and still expect them to pay higher wages. The only thing this government is good at is spending other people's money—but the light at the end of this tunnel is a fast-approaching train.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently read a letter sent by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs to the department of health about the inquiry into the aged care package of bills. I was staggered to discover that despite the recent Senate inquiry the committee has been unable to obtain adequate information regarding the 'content of regulations and other instruments to be made under the legislation'. However, despite this the committee has decided to present its report on the legislation on 31 May 2013, rather than the date originally set by the Senate, 17 June 2013. The coalition senators on this committee opposed this change of reporting date, because they identified that this would result in reduced time for consideration of the legislation and, importantly, because key regulatory instruments that will affect the operation of the reforms are not available for consideration. The coalition senators tried to stop this report being rushed through the system but, in their usual manner, Labor and the Greens linked up to prevent thorough examination and consideration of the facts and happenings of what they are investigating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I honestly cannot decide which is worse: the fact that the department is not able to provide the Senate inquiry with the information it needs to make informed decisions, or the fact that Labor and the Greens are effectively saying they do not need the information from the department, because they know what is required and what is best. Either way, it is a scary situation for all involved in the aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having talked about how the Gillard government has chosen to betray the aged-care sector and older Australians, I do want to speak about a better future, which I hope we will have the chance to deliver after the federal election. Before doing so I would like to thank my friend and colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her leadership in aged care. The senator has a depth of understanding built on years of involvement in the sector, well before entering the Senate, and that understanding and the years of involvement and experience are certainly acknowledged by the providers and the peak bodies in Western Australia. I can assure the House that our approach will be different from the Labor way. We will form a partnership with the aged-care sector. We will work with them to achieve reform. The industry can look forward to properly negotiated agreements rather than having inquiries and then an imposed decision from above. They can look forward to the first ever aged-care providers agreement framework. It will be about respect and acknowledging not political advantage but national responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this process the coalition is committed to establishing a high-level aged-care provider agreement steering committee of key stakeholders to oversee the administration and implementation of the agreement and to provide advice to the minister. We will also establish an aged-care provider agreement working group which will undertake the detailed design and project work required to give effect to the agreement. The coalition understands that there is no-one else who knows the daily workings of the sector better than the aged-care providers themselves. The agreement framework will create the opportunity for the minister, government and stakeholders to more closely and effectively consider ongoing issues regarding timely and appropriate access to aged care. Our approach will help meet care needs now, and in the future we will ensure that the comfort and safety of older Australians is not compromised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the future will be brighter for the industry and those older Australians that are affected, to deal with these bills I support the amendment of the opposition to defer debate until the Senate committee has reported and to then seek amendments based on the outcomes of the Senate inquiry. It is the job of committees to make sure, particularly in this case, that the information is there and that the impact of bills such as these can be properly assessed. It is not the case that there is some time frame within which the legislation has to be gotten through before the implications are known, because then the outcomes could also be entirely negative. And, as we have talked about already, so many speakers have said there are implications that are not negative and that the industry does not want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In any case, in the future it will fall to a coalition government to clean up this Labor legacy of waste, mismanagement and, unfortunately, nepotism that defines this terrible Gillard government. The reality is that the sector will continue to go backwards until there is a change of government. I just hope that the crossbenchers will put older Australians first rather than continue to side with the government. It is clear, however, due to their lack of interest in this bill, that they will not do so. I hope that the Australian people see that Labor, the Greens and the Independents are in lock step, having betrayed older Australians and the aged-care sector. I do not think that there is any doubt that they are all the same: a threat to the sector and to the increasing number of Australians in need of aged care across this whole country. It is important that, when the time comes, Australians look at what affects them and look at the results of this parliament to make sure that they know who was responsible for what happened, and I hope that they support the right team. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is easy, and understandable, that you should be pessimistic about this government, everyone should be optimistic about our country. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, with the right product, our manufacturing, too, is capable of competing with the best in the world, even with the high dollar—as demonstrated by Cochlear, Blackmores, Murray Goulburn and RM Williams, whose boots I'm wearing tonight.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my purpose tonight is to assure you that a coalition government will do what's needed to restore the hope, reward and opportunity that should be your birthright.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government has—with its carbon tax, broken promises, and skyrocketing debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families are paying for this government's mistakes yet all you ever hear from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are excuses and promises to do better next time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should the coalition win the election, there will be no nasty surprises and there will be no lame excuses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No surprises and no excuses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's plan has two objectives: first, to take the budget pressure off Australian households; and second, to strengthen our economy so that, over time, there is more to go around for everyone. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only by delivering a strong economy can government deliver a sustainable National Disability Insurance Scheme as well as better schools.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So tonight I announce a major initiative to ease the financial pressure on Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A coalition government will keep the current income tax thresholds and the current pension and benefit fortnightly rates while scrapping the carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The carbon tax will go but no-one's personal tax will go up and no-one's fortnightly pension or benefit will go down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So with a change of government, your weekly and fortnightly budgets will be under less pressure as electricity prices fall and gas prices fall and the carbon tax no longer cascades through our economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will strengthen our economy—because there will less tax hitting Australian businesses but not their overseas competitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it will help families—because you will have tax cuts funded by smaller government, not by taking money out of one pocket just to put it in the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan starts with recognition of economic reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government does not create wealth; people do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government does not spend its own money; it spends your money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's spending is either this year's taxes or it is this year's borrowing—and that is next year's taxes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government spending is not a free gift but something that everyone is paying for, now or in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why good governments are at least as careful spending the money they hold on trust from the people as you are when making decisions that affect your family's budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the Treasurer began his budget speech with this declaration, and I quote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the … success of our policies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, surpluses would have been a vindication.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is four years after the Treasurer and the Prime Minister said that the surplus had actually been delivered and spent tens of thousands of your dollars boasting about it in letters to their constituents.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If a public company made these sorts of claims, its directors would most likely face serious charges rather than asking to be re-elected.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWE" type="MemberSpeech1">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Mr SIMPKINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">09:43</span>):  On 15 April I attended the Barnardos Mother of the Year ceremony in WA. There were three finalists: three ladies with impressive stories and impressive characters. All have done great things for their families and embody in every way the very best of motherhood in our community. On this occasion I would like to speak of the runner-up, Tennille McConkey. Tennille is 37 years old, she is single and she has seven children. She is the mother of two and the foster parent of five. A couple of weeks ago I visited Tennille because I wanted to know more about her and why she is a foster parent. I learned a lot and she is without doubt an inspiration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tennille McConkey comes from a dysfunctional family. She has faced many problems since she left home at 16. She had her daughter around then, and she also left her church. She describes herself a bit of a wild child. At the age of 23 she decided that she wanted more children and decided that she would do foster parenting. In the last 14 years she has fostered more than 30 children. Often they have been Indigenous, and four of her five current children are Indigenous. She is now the legal guardian of almost all the children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we spoke about the issue of adoption, Tennille made an interesting comment. She said that she would like to adopt the children; however, the trouble with the Australian past history of forced adoptions is that 'this country now hates adoption'. Given the clear failure of so many actual parents to raise their children safely and positively, it is a shame that adoption of Australian children is now practically impossible. Many children would have a far better future, I am sure of it. As Tennille often says, too many children live in limbo because even now case officers seem to be trying to get children back to their parents despite there being clearly better options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true to say that financially Tennille struggles. One of Tennille's children has intellectual problems due to foetal alcohol syndrome. She has seven children aged between two and 16 and it is a big load. She is in a private rental as well. Yet the children are very polite and have been well cared for. It is a highly positive home and so therefore I pay tribute to Tennille McConkey for what she does. She has a great attitude and I would like to quote her again because this is something we should all do. She says, 'I do not allow my children to use their circumstances as an excuse for behaving badly.' Tennille does not just say that, she lives it as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the recent past she has had breast cancer and has lost one brother to a traffic accident and another to a heart attack in the last couple of years. In amongst all that she has been studying to become a midwife. When I think about what Tennille has achieved with her seven children and what she has overcome, I can only say that she is amazing. If everyone had an attitude like hers, this country would be an even better place to live.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation1">):</span>  On 6 April I met up with the New South Wales opposition leader, John Robertson, at Revesby Fire Station in the electorate of Banks. That day the fire station was closed. On 26 April I noticed that the fire station was also closed and posted a photo of the sign on my Facebook page. What is interesting is that the photo had the largest number of hits of any posted. This indicates to me that the decisions of the O'Farrell government in relation to staffing are of vital importance to many people. The New South Wales government is closing down fire stations and not replacing firefighters who are sick or on leave. In fact, Revesby joins Riverwood and Mortdale fire stations, also in my electorate, with other fire stations that have been closed arbitrarily. If a house is burning and the fire truck takes 30 minutes to arrive instead of 10 because the nearby station is shut, it may mean the difference between life and death. This is totally unacceptable to my community and to the broader community of New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts have also been made to the Rural Fire Service. In late 2012 it was revealed the O'Farrell government planned to slash $12 million from employee expenses at the RFS and cut 120 jobs. These cuts come on top of $64 million cut from the New South Wales Fire Brigade, forcing local fire stations to temporarily close their doors when firefighters call in sick. These cuts to firefighters come on top of 3,600 jobs to go from hospitals and ambulance stations 2,400 jobs cut from schools and TAFE colleges and almost 1,000 job cuts in community services. This is in addition to job cuts at Sydney Water, Roads and Maritime Services, Office of Environment and Heritage, Forests NSW, RailCorp and in many other government departments further job losses are anticipated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the O'Farrell government came to office in March 2011, there are 19,873 more unemployed people in New South Wales. This is what the future holds for the Australian people if an Abbott government is elected. This is in stark contrast to the record of the Labor federal government, which has created in excess of 950,000 jobs. These are 950,000 jobs created in spite of the Queensland government, the New South Wales government and the Victorian government shedding jobs. If you have got a job you can send your kids to school, you can pay a mortgage, you can pay your hospital fees. Jobs are more important than any other matter in the community. Without a job, you crush families' hopes. That is what an Abbott government will do if it is elected. People are insecure because of that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">09:49</span>):  This week is National Volunteer Week and today I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge some of the hardworking volunteers in my electorate. In the lead up to National Volunteer Week, I visited several community groups in Macarthur that rely on their hardworking volunteers to make a difference in our community. I have said many times in this place that volunteers are the backbone of many organisations in my electorate. Our local volunteers hold a very special place in so many of our community groups and organisations in Macarthur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week I was honoured to attend the Macarthur Diversity Services Initiative 2013 Volunteer of the Year awards in Campbelltown. MDSI is a community based charity organisation that provides a wide range of fantastic services for residents of Macarthur, particularly to those from different cultural backgrounds. MDSI has more than 100 volunteers who give their time tirelessly working on a variety of programs such as playgroups, youth groups and aged-care programs to help local families connect with the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year MDSI recognised its volunteers with a continuous commitment to support the great services that MDSI provides in Macarthur. One of these volunteers was Lynn Moore, a compassionate lady who has devoted 30 years of volunteering in Macarthur. During this time Lynn has had various roles assisting frail aged people. Thirty years of volunteering is an outstanding achievement and is something Lynn should be very, very proud of. Jacquelyn Perales was named the 2013 MDSI Volunteer of the Year. Jacquelyn has been a volunteer for MDSI since 2007 and was nominated by the staff for her compassion, understanding and commitment to volunteering for the organisation. She is a lovely young lady who is dedicated to helping others in the Macarthur community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I also attended the Campbelltown Jubilee Awards organised by Campbelltown Council and hosted by Mayor Sue Dobson. The jubilee awards recognise individuals who live in Campbelltown and who have contributed to the community for 50 years or more. The award also recognises members of Campbelltown's Indigenous community who have volunteered for more than 30 years. I felt very proud to see 23 recipients of the jubilee award this year—a mighty achievement by these outstanding people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week I also had the pleasure of attending another fantastic community organisation, Camden Community Connections, at its Bunnings fundraising barbecue. Camden Community Connections runs many services and activities in my electorate, including playgroups, youth drop-in services, seniors groups and young mothers' groups. In the lead-up to Volunteers Week a number of volunteers wrapped Mother's Day gifts at local shopping centres to raise money for Lifeline Macarthur. As a Lifeline ambassador, I am always impressed by the ongoing dedication of its amazing volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to commend the dedicated staff and volunteers from all of the charity groups across Macarthur. All of our volunteers have a special place in my community. The people of Macarthur appreciate our volunteers' generosity, dedication, compassion, reliability and tolerance when assisting those with special needs in our community. I look forward to recognising some of those wonderful volunteers in the 2013 Volunteer of the Year awards in December. To all our volunteers in Macarthur, thanks a million.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">09:55</span>):  Anzac Day has a significant place in the hearts and minds of all Australians. It is an opportunity to take the time to pause and remember those who have given their lives so that we can enjoy the freedoms today that we so often take for granted. Anzac Day is always a special time for the residents of Ryan, particularly for those who have friends and family based at the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera. Thousands of local residents attended dawn services, ceremonies and marches across the electorate on Anzac Day to pay tribute to the service men and women who have served overseas. As the daughter of a serviceman and the mother of a soldier who was serving overseas—he returned home early this morning—I was honoured to be invited to take part in and attend a number of local services. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many schools, veterans organisations, aged-care homes and especially the RSLs in the electorate who held such special ceremonies this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anzac Day is a particularly important day for so many Australians and our military history would not be complete without remembering the veterans of the Boer War. The Boer War was fought between 1899 and 1902 and ranks third behind the two world wars for the most Australian casualties. Sadly, to this day, there is still no national memorial to honour those who fought so courageously in this battle which marks the birth of the Australian Defence Force, which has served this country so well these past 110 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of parliament, I regularly receive petitions on a range of subjects. However, I must confess that last Tuesday, 14 May, was the first time that a petition was delivered to me on horseback. My colleague Senator Ronaldson, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, and I were the recipients of a petition with 10,200 signatures calling on the federal government to support a national Boer War Memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra to honour the 23,000 men and women of Australia who served our country in the Boer War, some 1,000 of whom gave their lives. I particularly want to pay tribute to the Vietnam veteran and Boer War veteran descendant, retired Lieutenant Colonel Miles Farmer OAM from Queensland and Captain Mike Fitzgerald, in Boer War mounted light horse uniform, and his horse, Boy, who came from Sydney especially to present the position. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many other families, I have a special interest as my great uncle, Major Edmund Righetti, volunteered as a private to join the Victorian first contingent to go to the Boer War in 1899. He was severely wounded, invalided home and after convalescence returned to South Africa and rose through the ranks. The men and women involved in this conflict deserve to be remembered with a lasting and fitting memorial, and I urge everyone to support this significant project.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">09:58</span>):  I rise today to speak about a great program funded by the Australian government, the Australian government Personal Helpers and Mentors program—PHaMs. Last month, I had the pleasure of catching up with John Bateup, the CEO of WISE Employment at the WISE Employment office in Cranbourne to announce that WISE Employment had received $1.4 million over three years under this program to assist people with mental illness lead fulfilling and complete lives. The most inspiring bit about this program was hearing about the positive impact it had on people's lives, in particular one participant, Megan Powell. Megan's story was quite powerful and she actually related it at this launch. I will give you an abridged version of it. In effect, her testimony is a testament to the effectiveness of the program. Her story starts on 16 January 2010 when her life with her partner, as she said, was a good one. Her partner would stay at home and look after the son who was going extremely well. She was allowed to work as a self-employed market research interviewer. For a little boy, what better life was there than staying home with dad or travelling around camping and fishing. Relaxing one evening, however, Megan had a knock at the door. It was a police officer. They had come to inform her that her partner had passed away while camping earlier that day. This news quite understandably shell-shocked Megan. She tried to move on but she could not. In the next 18 months, the thoughts and depression started to consume her and she basically began to struggle to do the simple things in life—not being able to get up to take her son to school, not being able to work. Megan was down on the world and angry, and she could not see any light at the end of the tunnel. She was now a single mum, unemployed and living in a housing commission home. For six months, Megan could see no point to life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in January 2012, Megan came across the PHaMS program after it was referred to her by a friend. She originally approached PHaMS for help to establish a routine, but that program became much more significant in her life, particularly an individual called Chris Browning, who brought her into the program, where she was able to discuss her concerns. One of the terrible things when tragedies of this nature happen is that you are not able to describe in a group what you are experiencing and what you are feeling. This program enabled Megan to do that and to seek the treatment and the help she needed. That gave her the confidence to change careers and she enrolled in a Certificate IV in Community Services Work. She has had her challenges, there is absolutely no doubt about that; but I think Megan's story, the way her life is moving forward and the way she has overcome her struggles, is a great testament to the program, to Chris Browning and to all those people at the Cranbourne WISE. I want to praise the program and the great help it gives to people in their lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">10:01</span>):  I rise today to talk about a visit to Kalgoorlie recently by the Australian Ausdrill Hockeyroos and Jillaroos side. They visited Kalgoorlie last Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I would like to congratulate the Eastern Goldfields Hockey Association, particularly Andrew Hoare as president of the association, for the outstanding job they did in getting the Hockeyroos to Kalgoorlie-Boulder and also for the great event they put on when the players were there. They also played a game against a Goldfields all-star team made up of men and women. My congratulation to Mel Woods, who was the goalie. Although the Hockeyroos won 8-0, as you would expect, our Goldfields side put up an outstanding fight against them. Mel Woods, our goalie, was adjudged best on field for the Goldfields side, which was no mean feat; considering the Hockeyroos kept firing shot after shot, it was an outstanding effort from her. Young Nicolas Lavery, an outstanding Goldfields player, was another prominent player for us. Congratulations to Holly Creedan, a 14-year-old girl who made the side, and also to Sarah Zapelli, who was the oldest member—and I will not declare Sarah's age in the chamber!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to sincerely thank Ausdrill for facilitating the trip. Peter Chisholm and Brad Loane from Ausdrill went all out in ensuring that it was a great visit. The Hockeyroos and Jillaroos held school clinics, umpiring clinics, hockey clinics, and clinics for general fitness and wellbeing. I had the pleasure of attending a civic reception put on by the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder on Thursday night where we got to meet all the girls and the support staff. It was a particular pleasure to meet a young lady called Tennille Attard, who has endured three knee reconstructions and is still an integral member of the Australian Hockeyroos side. It is testament not only to her resilience but to the resilience of the Hockeyroos. The Hockeyroos are arguably one of Australia's most outstanding sporting teams. They are a credit to Australia, they are a credit to their sport and they are a credit to women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Friday night of the game, over 1,000 people attended the Eastern Goldfields hockey stadium. Entry was by a gold coin donation to the Breast Cancer Foundation. I have got no idea what they raised but it was an outstanding evening. As I said, the score was 8-0 but our Goldfields side put in an outstanding effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I once again congratulate Andrew Hoare and his committee from the Eastern Goldfields Hockey Association for the outstanding event and the wonderful opportunity for the Goldfields people to see elite sport at its very best. I sincerely thank the Australian Ausdrill Hockeyroos.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Braddon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles1">Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">10:04</span>):  Good morning, colleagues. Lots of things have been happening in Tassie since we were here last, particularly in my region. First and foremost, the Tasmanian forests agreement has finally been signed. I congratulate all the signatories. It was three years of hard work to arrive at a consensus. We hope the forest industry will be able to continue in a very sustainable footing in Tassie and that we can protect those areas that we have pride in and that need protection. At the same time we can develop a future for that industry as well. So I congratulate all those signatories. The federal government stands ready, willing and able to assist that process, as we always have been. There is $300 million now to roll out to support those who are going to be affected by this serious structural change. Unfortunately it is change that is necessary. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the mainstream green movement for supporting this. But I would ask Bob Brown, Christine Milne, Peg Putt and the extreme green organisations and individuals to cease now their old green politics and to support consensus and compromise; to allow this to happen, to give it a future. Instead, what we have is their old policy of no compromise and all conflict. I ask them again to cease their deliberate confrontational actions both in our forests, our forest industries and in the Tarkine—and most especially in their attempts to destabilise the responsible economic development in the region of west and north-west of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister came to visit and wanted to congratulate Fonterra at Wynyard on their successful program from the Clean Technology Investments Program to install eight new cheese vats and reduce their heating. They carved emissions, saving up to $140,000 in their energy costs per year. They also receive $434,000 to boost their extension program to help farmers to reduce nitrous oxide emissions. Whilst the Prime Minister was visiting, she also announced $125,000 for the Darrel Baldock memorial project at Latrobe, and I am very grateful to her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the privilege of attending the trail bike project at Penguin, which we put $53,000 into with support from DEEWR and Equity Labour Services and with the work of Ian Faulkner, James McCormick and DEEWR officers. This is a 12-week program to support seven young local people to build a world-class trail bike project. That was one of many.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">10:07</span>):  I rise today to raise awareness, as some of my colleagues have, on Volunteer Week. Volunteer Week runs this week from 13 May to 19 May. This year's theme is to say 'Thanks a million'. If it wasn't for our volunteers, there would be organisations in our community that would not survive. National Volunteer Week has been going since 1986. About 36 per cent of Australian people, or just over six million people, volunteer every year in some way or another. They contribute about 713 million hours of unpaid work. It was interesting to find out that the typical age group of volunteers is around 35 to 44, and 65 to 74. But in my electorate, where the median age is about 33, we have a lot of young people who do volunteer work in our community and that is really pleasing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay tribute to all of the volunteers in Darwin and Palmerston for the outstanding work they do in our community. From me to them: thanks a million for the work that you do. We all know that volunteers are the backbone of many organisations and the community; we would not be able to carry out the work we do if it were not for our volunteers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers are people who coach kids' sports teams. They deliver Meals on Wheels and provide things like the Northern Territory Field and Game, which is a conservation organisation. They do community work. Sids and Kids, of which I am the patron, has many volunteers, particularly Fiona Peters, who has given up so much of her time. We had the Mother's Day Classic on the weekend where so many volunteers were involved in the event. They helped to organise the getting of about 2,000 people into Darwin, walking and raising awareness of breast cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge Carolyn Reynolds in our community, who is very active and who volunteers in so many different organisations. Bill Miller volunteers for the Palmerston Football Club. Penny Lasette is actively involved in a number of organisations. We have the Kiwanis Group and the Rotarians. Celina Hodge volunteers with Camp Quality and is in the middle of organising a big fundraising event. Elena Gomatos is very active in the Greek community. She was integral in organising Australia's Biggest Morning Tea. Thanks a million to all those many volunteers. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>)</span>

It is important that we recognise these veterans for the work that they have done overseas in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First was John Sharley. He served in Australia's commitment to the war in Vietnam in the sixties and early seventies as a leading aircraftman with the RAAF. He went to South Vietnam between 1970 and 1971. John worked on the Caribous and many other types of aircraft during the time he was in South Vietnam. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of our involvement in Vietnam is close to my heart. I have visited the country and seen where Australians have fought and died. I have also strongly supported the building of the Vietnam Veterans Commemorative Walk in Seymour and I look forward to a very positive announcement from Minister King, hopefully, later this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also Ted Daniell. Ted is a proud Darwin defender. He was only 13 when the war started but, as soon as he turned 18, he joined up and headed to Darwin as part of the RAAF. He spent the last years of the war protecting our important northern communications bases and seaports from enemy attack, especially from the air.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was Herbert O'Brien, who, according to Herbert's records, joined just days before the imperial Japanese launched their offensive, in December 1941, on Pearl Harbor. He joined the RAAF and served until several months after the end of the war, leaving his service as a leading aircraftman. His service saw him sent to New Guinea, Europe and the Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also Basil Penrose. Basil served in the Royal Australian Navy in both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. His service is listed on the World War II Nominal Roll, from January 1943 through to March 1946. His service included being a stoker on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Quiberon</span>, a Q-class British-built destroyer, where he served most of his time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Posthumously, we presented Jack Sheehan his certificate. Jack passed away just a couple of weeks before Anzac Day, at the age of 93. I had the pleasure of meeting Jack when he was selling poppies at Kilmore Coles last year and he kept me there for an hour as we talked about the stories that he had from the war. Jack joined up at the age of 18, in 1939, shortly after war was declared, at the Shepparton Drill Hall, being placed with one of the earliest formed battalions in the AIF from the Victorian 2/7th. With them, he went off in early 1940 by ship to the Middle East, North Africa and eventually to the ill-fated Greece and Crete campaigns in spring 1941.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jack's story is amazing. He was captured as a prisoner of war where he recalled the poor conditions of the camp. He described one as 'dirty, with plenty of lice and slit trenches for latrines,' and he described a camp in Greece that was made up of 'flea- and bug-ridden huts'. He further stated, 'Most of us had lost weight during the time through dysentery, with very little food.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He recalled how it was a harrowing experience. Jack was able to escape and, eventually, he walked from Germany all the way to England before coming back to Australia where he lived a fulfilling life.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">Debate resumed on the motion by <span style="font-weight:bold;">Mr Dreyfus</span>:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">That the House support the apology given by the Prime Minister to people affected by forced adoption and removal policies and practices in the following terms: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Today, this Parliament, on behalf of the Australian people, takes responsibility and apologises for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge the profound effects of these policies and practices on fathers. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">And we recognise the hurt these actions caused to brothers and sisters, grandparents, partners and extended family members. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We deplore the shameful practices that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children. You were not legally or socially acknowledged as their mothers. And you were yourselves deprived of care and support. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To you, the mothers who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice, we apologise. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We say sorry to you, the mothers who were denied knowledge of your rights, which meant you could not provide informed consent. You were given false assurances. You were forced to endure the coercion and brutality of practices that were unethical, dishonest and in many cases illegal. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We know you have suffered enduring effects from these practices forced upon you by others. For the loss, the grief, the disempowerment, the stigmatisation and the guilt, we say sorry. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To each of you who were adopted or removed, who were led to believe your mother had rejected you and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin and to connect with your culture, we say sorry. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We apologise to the sons and daughters who grew up not knowing how much you were wanted and loved. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge that many of you still experience a constant struggle with identity, uncertainty and loss, and feel a persistent tension between loyalty to one family and yearning for another. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To you, the fathers, who were excluded from the lives of your children and deprived of the dignity of recognition on your children's birth records, we say sorry. We acknowledge your loss and grief. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We recognise that the consequences of forced adoption practices continue to resonate through many, many lives. To you, the siblings, grandparents, partners and other family members who have shared in the pain and suffering of your loved ones or who were unable to share their lives, we say sorry. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many are still grieving. Some families will be lost to one another forever. To those of you who face the difficulties of reconnecting with family and establishing on-going relationships, we say sorry. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation's history. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To those who have fought for the truth to be heard, we hear you now. We acknowledge that many of you have suffered in silence for far too long. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are saddened that many others are no longer here to share this moment. In particular, we remember those affected by these practices who took their own lives. Our profound sympathies go to their families. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To redress the shameful mistakes of the past, we are committed to ensuring that all those affected get the help they need, including access to specialist counselling services and support, the ability to find the truth in freely available records and assistance in reconnecting with lost family. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We resolve, as a nation, to do all in our power to make sure these practices are never repeated. In facing future challenges, we will remember the lessons of family separation. Our focus will be on protecting the fundamental rights of children and on the importance of the child's right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech1">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">10:15</span>):  It was my honour to be asked by the previous Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, to be on the committee to draft the apology for forced adoption. It was a tough task. We were very ably led, but a number of people who had been the victims of forced adoption appeared before the committee. They were mainly the mothers forced to give up their babies for adoption, and even a father appeared before the committee. People like Paul Howes also appeared. It was quite an experience for me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should stress that the reason I appeared on the committee drafting the national apology for forced adoptions is that my sister had had a child adopted when she was 14. She has never classed it as a forced adoption, although my mum was a single parent at the time. My dad had left and there were nine kids in the house. My sister gave as much content as a pregnant 14-year-old child can give. However, that has been a fantastic story as far as adoptions go. My nephew Andrew Garvey was adopted by a wonderful family. He has had a magnificent relationship with the family who adopted him and my sister now has a great relationship with him. I remember meeting him at my sister's 50th birthday, which was like finding a new family member. He fits in wonderfully, and it is great to have a new nephew. I think Andrew is a constituent of the member for Solomon, although I hope he does not support her! I will have to check with him next time I catch up with him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, not every person involved with forced adoptions has had such a wonderful experience. Being on the committee that drafted the national apology for forced adoption, we heard incredibly sad tales. In the consultations around Australia—not that I was involved in all of those as I went only to the ones in Brisbane—we heard horrific tale after horrific tale. I urge people to read the report of the Senate committee, chaired by the Greens Senator Rachel Siewert, that set up the process that led to the Prime Minister delivering the national apology for forced adoption on Thursday, 21 March this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, democracy being what it is, that day was not a great day. It was also the day of the faux coup, and that took a lot of the attention of the nation from the forced adoption apology. However, those people who were in the Great Hall and heard the Prime Minister's apology were moved significantly, including the Leader of the Opposition since this was a bipartisan event. The apology from the Prime Minister was significant although it will not make up for past wrongs and it could never make up for the heartache of those who never got to see their mum or their families and who have never found out who their parents are. Not everyone has a magnificent story like Andrew Garvey, my nephew, not that that story does not have a heartache attached to it as well. However, the nation saying sorry was a significant gesture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My first day in parliament was the day the member for Griffith, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, delivered an apology to the stolen generation. That was the very first thing I did as a member of parliament in Canberra. There was a welcome to country first and then we had the apology. It was an incredibly moving moment. It was an apology that has been heard around the world and that gesture lifted the standing of this nation. Again, it was a bipartisan gesture from both sides of parliament. I remember Brendan Nelson, then Leader of the Opposition, delivering the apology on behalf of the opposition. These as well as the other national apology are significant gestures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As there is a Western Australian in the chamber, the deputy leader of the opposition, I particularly mention the contribution of the member for Swan, which was incredibly moving. He is surely one of the most significant gentlemen in this parliament. He is well liked on both sides of the chamber. The way he carried himself throughout his speech is a memory I will always have. I remember his first speech when he touched on some of these messages as well. It was incredibly moving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national apology for forced adoptions is something that we should be proud of as a parliament. These chambers can be quite adversarial sometimes, but I remind the Australian people that we can step up and do things in the national interest and be united. Thursday, 21 March, when the Prime Minister delivered the national apology for forced adoptions, is a day that should be remembered, and I am particularly proud of it. I commend the apology to the House.</span>
              </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">10:22</span>):  I rise on behalf of the coalition to lead some comments on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, which extends the interim measures applicable to the military justice system following the invalidation of the act establishing the Australian Military Court in 2009. This is the second time I will speak on an interim measures military justice bill—almost two years to the day that I spoke on the last interim justice bill. The interim measures are about the ability to actually pay the current judges who sit on the tribunals because we still do not have a military justice bill in the House to debate—staggering I know, unbelievable at best. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A little history is always good. The Australian Military Court was established in 2007 in a bipartisan series of legislation following a number of Senate committees and other reports. On 26 August 2009, the High Court handed down a decision in Lane v Morrison that found the Australian Military Court unconstitutional. The High Court found unanimously that the provisions of the DFDA 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because it purported to exercise judicial power over the Commonwealth but did not meet the requirements of chapter III of the Constitution. Therefore, the interim measures bill was put into the parliament in 2009 to deal with the issues at hand and provide interim measures so that judges and other judicial officers could be paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were told by Minister Faulkner at the time, in 2009, that this was about rectifying the military legal problems and that it would be afforded the government's highest priority. Yet by 22 June 2011 we still had no bill in the House to deal with Australian military justice. So the first interim measures came in, and here we are two years later—four years after the Minister for Defence said, 'this will be afforded the government's highest priority'—and we are still passing interim measures bills so that justices can be paid, because this government cannot get a bill together to put in place a military court that satisfies the constitutional requirements. It is simply and utterly staggering. But when you look at the litany of this government's highest priorities, even in Defence, it is staggering. I will read a paragraph from my speech on 22 June 2011:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Keeping military matters in mind, in 2007—I look at the member for Moreton—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and, surprise, surprise, here he is again—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">who came in in 2007—the government said in the election campaign that one of its highest priorities was to address the fairness of the indexation of defence pensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Member for Moreton, you came in on that platform, you came in spruiking the fairness of veterans' pensions. After six years, where are we? What have you done, sir, to ensure that military pensions for DFRDB are properly indexed? What has the member for Moreton done? The answer is: nothing. </span>
                </p>

                    </a>  No, I won't take a question, Member for Moreton, so sit yourself down and find a way to explain to your constituents why, in six years, you have done nothing for the veterans of our country. In 2009, it was 'the highest priority to address the issue of military justice.' It was the highest priority to index military pensions. Nothing was done in six years. Do you know what another highest priority was, Mr Deputy Speaker? Defence of the realm and national security were the highest priority. Prime Minister Rudd issued the first national security statement and promised that every single year he would update that. He never updated it, and the current Prime Minister has done one. We have had two in six years—and national security is the 'highest priority'. In fact, national security is of such a high priority that the current Prime Minister would not attend the National Security Committee of cabinet; she would send her bodyguard. That is how much 'high priority' the Prime Minister puts on national security.</span>

                    </a>  Goodness! Would that have been Kevin? Who would have thought! If national security is so important, why has this government cumulatively cut $25 billion from defence—statement of fact? Why, if it was such a high priority? I am sick and tired of this government's 'highest priorities' when it comes to defence.</span>

But when you read through it—their great announcement that there would be $2.9 billion for electronic attack warfare Growlers, how much extra money did the government give for Growler attack? Was it $200 million? $2.7 billion is absorbed.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am simply looking at what the last Minister for Defence said; we are onto our third in six years. He said it was the highest priority. To understand what the minister says when it comes to 'highest priority', a history lesson is also worthwhile.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude with another paragraph out of the last speech I gave on this bill—which was to provide interim measures—two years ago. I said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it takes two years to move to reaffirm the interim measures bill, which was the highest priority, frankly I am not holding my breath on the government's capacity, capability, courage and conviction to actually get a proper bill before the House. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what I said two years ago. I went on:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is 12 months since fundamental injustice day, 12 months since the government lost its way. The Prime Minister's three priorities are still nowhere. All we have learnt is that the Prime Minister's highest priorities simply do not get any priority and the Minister for Defence's highest priorities get zero priority. That is a fabulous analogy for this wretched government—moribund, rotten and incapable of actually setting an agenda or a vision for the nation; setting priorities it does not keep and setting agendas it has no hope of ever reaching.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech1">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">10:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, a piece of legislation that I know a lot about. I would have thought that the shadow Defence spokesperson would have looked at the legislation and made some contribution. Obviously he is not that familiar with military justice. However, perhaps he will make the time to look into it. Justice in the military is obviously a complicated issue. It is that classic intersection between the personal rights of a member of the ADF and the national interest. Historically, the justice meted out in the military has been quite severe. If you are a member of the ADF, something as simple as falling asleep at work—which could happen in this parliament and might involve ridicule—could result in a significant loss of life among your colleagues, and therefore the penalty for falling asleep on your watch is quite significant. So there are different standards of justice in the military, and appropriately so. Obviously, they have evolved over the years. Hopefully, we are at the last and most logical iteration and, in light of the High Court's decision, this additional bill will bring resolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should declare a slight interest in this because in my spare time—not that I have much—I am a legal officer, a flight lieutenant, in the RAAF. So it is an area of law that I am particularly interested in. And certainly the High Court challenge in the case of Lane and Morrison changed the approach to military justice. I would like to mention a couple of people from my electorate who are also legal officers in the RAAF—Uso Akari and Mike Nichols. They are two lawyers who give their time to go and work in the reserves. I mention them because they are from my electorate—I could mention many others. I should also mention our panel chair, David Montgomery, who does a great job. He has provided significant amounts of advice to me as to how this legislation should proceed—which I have done my best to pass on, I assure you, Monty. But getting it right does take a little bit of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of this legislation, as stated earlier by the member for Moncrieff, is that there has been a bipartisan approach. The Australian Military Court was established in 2006, comprising a chief military judge, two permanent military judges and a part-time reserve panel of judges—it is important to get that balance right. At the time, the Howard government hoped that the Australian Military Court would satisfy the principles of impartiality and judicial independence. I think there was advice about the implications under the Constitution and that it would actually have contravened chapter III of the Constitution, but people made the call at the time. I do not begrudge the Howard government, the defence minister of the time or the Attorney-General; it was a reasonable call to make. Obviously, in hindsight it was the wrong call. I do not fault the logic of the justices in the Lane and Morrison case. However, we do need to get it right and, despite all the bluff and bluster of the shadow spokesman for defence, we need to get it correct. Having a look at the type of people who will be able to step up is obviously one of the reasons there has been some delay in making sure that we get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This interim measure, hopefully, will not have effect for long but will be a precursor to a system of justice that will support the individual member of the ADF but also apply the military discipline that is so important in peacetime in places such as Amberley. But it has to be the same military justice system that is operating on the front line in Afghanistan. As we heard from the Minister for Defence this morning when he addressed the parliament, there can be incredible stress placed on our ADF personnel, whether they be on ships, in the air or at the front line. They have to make incredibly quick calls about the rules of engagement and how they will operate in certain circumstances—this is especially so in places like Afghanistan, where the Taliban are working alongside you, in secret, with the intent of doing you harm. So it is important to get the right legal advice and the right rules of engagement and to know how they will operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The modern soldier is a very skilled operator. The standards that we see in the ADF are incredibly high. I first encountered the ADF through the parliamentary participation program, when I spent a week out at Amberley. I was blown away at how professional our ADF personnel were, particularly those in the RAAF—I say that because all of my cousins are in the RAAF. In fact, my cousin is in the media at the moment. I was speaking to her on Monday night. It is amazing because of the phone links. They are just going about their business in 51 degree heat with full body armour, but with modern communications they can just phone home as well. The modern world has particular challenges but the modern military justice still has to go back to the core basics of maintaining discipline while being fair, and of entitling people to the appropriate representation. I commend the legislation to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="217266" type="MemberSpeech1">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">10:38</span>):  I rise to speak on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013. Today's bill will extend the interim regime established by the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 following the High Court's invalidation of the original legislation establishing the Australian Military Court in Lane v Morrison in 2009. The Labor government previously announced details of the Military Court of Australia Bill 2012 as legislation to conclude the interim measures; however, as I understand it, the government has not yet adequately worked through the many unresolved legal issues in that bill. Therefore, the coalition supports these interim measures as drafted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim regime provides for the appointment and remuneration of the Chief Judge Advocate and other statutory office holders on a fixed tenure of four years, which will expire in September 2013. The purpose of today's bill is to extend their tenure for an additional two years or such lesser period as the Minister for Defence specifies by legislative instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From my many engagements with the ADF I know that all Australian Defence Force members take their roles and the responsibility that comes with being in the ADF very seriously and act accordingly. It is true, however, that we have a criminal law system set up with courts to deal with transgressions against the law, and in the same way we have encoded in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 the transgressions against the law by servicemen and servicewomen which, in their conduct through the ADF, are not civilian in nature and should be dealt with by a specific military court, not just a federal magistrate. The concept of the Military Court of Australia is therefore a recognition that the role of Australia's military justice system is to support command in reinforcing discipline and enhancing operational effectiveness. In terms of serious service offences, it takes the adjudicatory role function away from the ADF chain of command, which I will touch on later, and may comprise judicial officers who have a genuine understanding of the nature of service in the ADF by reason of their experience or training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of an independent military court is not a new issue. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee conducted an inquiry into the effectiveness of the military justice system, and in that report it recommended that the Australian Military Court be established for serious service offences committed by ADF personnel. At the time, the committee recognised reforms that had been undertaken in other countries, including the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. It recognised that there is a lack of impartiality in courts martial and that there is a growing international trend towards independent military judicial officials in recognition of the fact that allowing service personnel access to independent and impartial tribunals makes for a more effective military justice system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Howard government implemented 32 of the 40 recommendations and established the Australian Military Court on 1 October 2007. However, in August 2009, as a result of the Lane v Morrison case, the High Court of Australia unanimously found that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and provisions which created the Military Court were constitutionally invalid, as Commonwealth judicial power could only be exercised under chapter III of the Constitution. The Australian Military Court was therefore suspended, and a bipartisan approach was taken with the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence to return serious service offences to the old approach—namely, the system of courts martial and Defence Force magistrate trials. During that process, given that all convictions recorded by the AMC between October 2007 and 26 August 2009 were consequentially invalid, legislation was passed to give effect to many of the punishments and orders made by the AMC, and punishment was reviewed for those convicted under the AMC practice. It has taken significant time to fully consider legislation that is in concordance with the use of Commonwealth judicial power under chapter III. The issue was sidelined, unfortunately, when the bill presented in June 2010 lapsed when parliament was dissolved on 19 July 2010, when the federal election was called.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to comment on those lingering legal issues around the establishment of the Military Court of Australia. In the submissions that have been made over the years about this issue, there are two main concerns about the structure and function of the court. First, the Military Court of Australia, by design, will not feature a jury process, normally afforded to all Australian citizens in section 80 of the Constitution, which states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the Returned and Services League, or RSL, is concerned that a court with only one military judge acting alone would be in contravention of the rights normally afforded to all Australian citizens, and that includes our servicemen and servicewomen. The original explanatory memorandum to the Military Court of Australia Bill 2012 claimed that a Military Court of Australia would be 'compatible with the human rights and freedoms recognised or declared in the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011' by engaging the following rights: the right to a fair trial, which means 'a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal'; freedom from arbitrary detention; the right to humane treatment in detention; and the right to privacy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of establishing a competent, independent and impartial tribunal, the court was to be set up such that people serving presently in the ADF would not be eligible to be a judge or federal magistrate under the court, and furthermore that the Military Court would be independent from the military chain of command. Importantly, in line with the practices of the Federal Court of Australia, the court would involve procedures for making appeals from the Appellate and Superior Division of the Military Court for decisions in the General Division of the MCA. Of course, following that process, appeals can be made to the High Court of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There would be offences contained in schedule 1 which delimit the types of classes and the circumstances under which someone alleged to have committed an act is to be tried. Those are class 1 offences, including offences relating to operations against an enemy and desertion, as well as offences including murder, manslaughter and serious sexual offences, which must be heard and determined by the Appellate and Superior Division of the Military Court of Australia. This is in line with serious criminal offences at the civilian level, which are heard by judges of a superior court—that is, the Supreme Court, rather than a magistrate's court. Other offences, as the explanatory memorandum notes, relate to service offences that go to the very core of maintaining discipline and morale in the ADF: abandoning or surrendering a post, harbouring enemies, failing to carry out orders, mutiny, desertion and dangerous conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in 2012 advised that it would not conduct a parallel inquiry into this issue given that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was also investigating the issue. I note that its report was published on 9 October 2012. During that process the coalition continued its deliberations and issued a dissenting report. The Liberal senators made three recommendations based on their concerns. They ultimately decided that all members of the ADF are entitled to the same rights and protections that other Australians receive in a chapter 3 court, and therefore recommended that the bill be amended to include the right to trial by jury for all offences which would customarily be listed on indictment in the civilian context. Therefore, the right to trial by jury should be afforded for service offences with a punishment of more than 12 months imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, they acknowledged the concerns of groups like the Australian Defence Association that permanent or active reservists would be ineligible for appointment to the Military Court, and as such recommended that, to the extent that chapter 3 of the Constitution would allow for permanent reservists and standby reservists to be appointed as judicial officers of the Military Court, as a consequence the available pool would be expanded to include people who have an understanding of military service and as such can make a meaningful contribution to the Military Court itself. I strongly agree that it is all very well for judicial officers to have an understanding of military service, but real experience of service and of battle provide an insight into the challenges of military decision making that a mere 'suitable understanding' cannot possibly achieve. The coalition senators noted that an important consequence of this recommendation would be to increase confidence in the court from both within the ADF and in the general public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted in my maiden speech my appreciation for the sacrifices that our troops make around the world. I also highlighted the fundamental importance of clear rules of engagement prior to entering any conflict. I said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">… if this nation fails to cloak our soldiers with the full protection of the law when they go into battle, we fail them all. The rules of engagement must be crystal clear and our support strong. If we put Australian troops into the heat of battle and expect them to take enormous risks on our behalf, we cannot expect them to be split-second lawyers as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ongoing consideration of the Military Court of Australia is an important part of that process of supporting and protecting our troops which, I have noted, is integral to the morale and wellbeing of ADF personnel. The coalition will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure that all issues are resolved appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More generally, and ultimately, it is up to the federal government to support its troops. This Labor government has cut more than $25 billion from Defence, which has crippled the Defence industry sector. In the last three years the industry has lost more than 5,000 jobs and will continue to shed jobs in light of this government's mismanagement of Defence. In 2009 the then Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, predicted that the local workforce would be as high as 34,000 by 2013. Today, however, that figure stands between 24,000 and 25,000 local jobs according to the Defence Materiel Organisation. Clearly, the Labor government's savage cuts to Defence are translating into a struggling Australian industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is unacceptable for what is a vital strategic sector of our economy. We should be supporting the growth of a home-grown Defence industry, not continuing to pull the rug out from underneath it. The Defence community has, since 2007, being represented by a Labor government that does not listen or support it, nor even action its own 2009 Defence white paper. More recently, the Minister for Defence released the 2013 Defence white paper, which was full of impressive photo opportunities but had no plan, no schedule and no money. In a document that talks boldly of new ships, new submarines and new aircraft there is no dollar figure listed for their construction.</span>

Please pass on our regards and thanks to him for that service, particularly having returned from the difficult environment of Afghanistan. I have had the opportunity to observe and understand the nature of that service.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This obviously has been an issue that has been fraught for some time. There have been many attempts to navigate some of the vagaries of the issues thrown up by military justice. In reply to some of the comments that were made about our commitment to defence spending, as you have seen in this budget, that spending has actually increased. In my quarter of a century of involvement in security policy in this country and in the Defence Force, I have never seen a more significant delivery of capability to the Defence Force in that time. It is a very exciting time for the Defence Force. We have carefully balanced the challenges of defence capability planning and are delivering capability that is going to set this country up very well for its security needs and for its ability to respond to disasters both nationally and within the region as well. I congratulate our service personnel, our service chiefs and all of those within the Defence Materiel Organisation who have helped us manage that difficult challenge of juggling the delivery of that capability with our revenue needs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summing up the debate on the Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013, I would like to thank all of those who have taken an interest in this issue and who have contributed to the debate. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the High Court on 26 August 2009 found unanimously that the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 establishing the Australian Military Court were invalid because they were not consistent with the requirements of chapter 3 of the Commonwealth Constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 was subsequently passed by this parliament to reinstate the pre-2007 military justice arrangements. This act ensured that military discipline arrangements, in particular the system of court martial and Defence Force magistrate trials, continued to operate effectively. The reinstatement of the pre-2007 military justice system was also required to allow time for the consideration and development of options for a new military justice system consistent with the requirements of chapter 3 of the Constitution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Act (No. 1) 2009 provided for a tenure of up to two years for the Chief Judge Advocate and the judge advocate's panel. The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2011 previously extended the appointment arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocate's panel for a two-year period. However, this tenure is due to expire in September.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Military Justice (Interim Measures) Amendment Bill 2013 will continue the appointment, remuneration and entitlement arrangements for the Chief Judge Advocate and judge advocate's panel for an additional two years or until the Minister for Defence declares by legislative instrument a specified day to be a termination day, whichever is sooner. The purpose of Australia's military discipline system is to support command in maintaining and enforcing service discipline in order to enhance operational effectiveness. A military discipline system that supports the authority and effectiveness of commanders is of vital importance in the operation of the Australian Defence Force. This bill is one contribution in support of an effective military discipline system.</span>

This is the second bill dealing with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, EFIC, that has come before parliament this year. As I noted in my speech regarding the previous bill, according to its official website, EFIC provides finance and insurance solutions to help Australian exporters overcome the financial barriers they face when growing their businesses overseas. It is the Australian government's export credit agency and assists export trade or overseas investments where the private market is unable to do so. Specifically, EFIC works directly with exporters or with their banks to provide loans, guarantees, bonds and insurance products not otherwise able to be provided by the private sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous bill sought to amend the financial arrangements of EFIC to provide for the payment of a special dividend of $200 million and any adjustments to EFIC's callable capital that may be necessary in future. The coalition did not oppose the bill at that time because we knew that this was just another aspect to Labor's failings when it comes to the management of its budget. It was part of the government's raid for every dollar of cash it could raise, and in fact it was surprising that EFIC had been untouched up until that time. This $200 million raid on EFIC came about because the government's finances are in a mess, and on Tuesday night we saw one of the most dishonest budgets presented since Federation. Labor's budget surplus promise is farcical, no-one believes it—I do not why they even bother to say it. The budget has plans for more and new taxes.</span>

                    </a>  I am explaining why EFIC is now $200 million shorter than it had been. And this budget exposes the budget crisis that has engulfed Labor and has caused them to make this call on EFIC's reserves.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this present bill, we will not oppose it. Like the previous bill, it follows recommendations and findings of the 2012 Productivity Commission inquiry report into Australia's export credit arrangements. It will principally permit the provision of increased services to small and medium-sized businesses and will permit more of EFIC's resources—reduced resources because of the $200 million raid on its callable reserves—to be directed to Australian small and medium-sized enterprises that face genuine barriers to accessing finance for export operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">EFIC will also be given a limited expansion of its guarantee powers so that it can better support Australian businesses and their integration into the global value chains. The bill also seeks to ensure that EFIC does not have a competitive advantage over other businesses in the private sector. In summary, the bill implements the Productivity Commission's recommendations that EFIC should be subjected to the government's competitive neutrality principles. Consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission and the 2003 Uhrig review, the bill will also remove the requirement to have a government member on EFIC's board of directors, and we welcome that, because this will increase the board's independence from government. It is expected that the market-failure test and the requirement to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises will reorient EFIC's operations on its commercial account towards supporting commercially viable—and I stress they must be commercially viable—export focused small and medium enterprises seeking to access export finance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government notes that the bill is required to ensure EFIC's support in domestic supply chains can only be provided when it involves a contract that is integral to final exports of capital and non-capital goods and services. The government also states that the bill is required to broaden EFIC's guarantee powers to enable EFIC to guarantee loans of foreign based subsidiaries of Australian based small and medium enterprises, where the purpose of the guarantee is to support 'Australian export trade' and where the SME certifies that the guarantee will not result in a net reduction in the number of its employees in Australia during the term of EFIC's guarantee. This will require a new definition of 'Australian export trade' in the bill to ensure that EFIC support is linked to benefits to Australia including through increased exports, access to new markets or increased dividend flows to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does not see any particular alarm bells ringing with these changes, and we will always support changes that will enhance EFIC's services to small and medium sized businesses. But I take the opportunity of noting that, like virtually everything this government does, there is always an alternative backstory. In the last EFIC bill, as I pointed out, Labor raided the coffers of EFIC, stripping $200 million out of the agency. Even with this raid the budget figures show that the government will breach the $300 billion debt ceiling limit it proposed by legislation during the forward estimates period. Small businesses have every reason to be disgusted with the way they have been abandoned by this government, as evidenced in Tuesday night's budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is at war with small business and it is obvious that Labor never seems to appreciate the fact that small business employs around half of all employees in Australia today. The Treasurer might talk about his budget being about jobs and growth, but he forecast a rise in unemployment and a fall in the rate of economic growth, and small business bears the brunt of that. It will take a change of government for small business to have a government on its side. However, the small changes in this bill may provide some support for small and medium-sized enterprises that are seeking to enter export markets. The coalition will not oppose the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">11:02</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (New Mandate and Other Measures) Bill 2013. EFIC is a very important part of our economy assisting small businesses in their efforts to export to the world market. I agree with the principles of this bill. However, I am concerned by some of the detail. I do not oppose the bill, but some of the detail will need to be looked at very closely in practice to see how it works and to ensure that it does benefit small business. I have experience in this area as I have worked with EFIC to look for export finance and insurance for overseas projects and overseas contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government in the explanatory memorandum sets out the purpose of this bill as giving 'new powers to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to better support Australian small and medium-sized businesses participating in global and regional value chains'. And don't small businesses need that assistance at the moment! The only way our small businesses can compete on the international playing field is if they have some type of competitive advantage. This government, with all its policies, seems to want to take away that competitive advantage. We have seen with the implementation of the carbon tax that the government is simply putting Australian exporters at a competitive disadvantage and making it harder for them to export to overseas markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard the government try and pretend that all other nations are having a carbon tax and that many other nations are putting on a carbon tax. The facts are that Australian exporters have to pay the world's highest carbon tax, which simply puts them at a competitive disadvantage. We are putting lead in our exporters' saddlebags, forcing them to compete on export markets overseas but placing them at a competitive disadvantage. That is the background. That is why anything we can do to assist our small and medium sized exporters is very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The specific concern I have about this bill is changing what is known as the market gap test to the market failure test. In the explanatory memorandum it notes that the government accepts that competitive neutrality principles should apply to EFIC to ensure that it does not have a net competitive advantage over other business or potential competitors. What that means for small business is that EFIC does not have a competitive advantage over our four major banks, because the reality is that when our small businesses want to seek finance to assist them with their exports, here in Australia they only have a choice of the four big banks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about market failure and failure in markets, one thing that is often thrown up about small business when they ask for improvements in competition laws or they suggest that competition is not working is that competition harms competitors. If that is true, how is it possible that all four of our big banks are at the moment substantially increasing their profits at the same time? It simply defies the logic that competition harms competitors. So what we see is the Reserve Bank interest rates, the decline we have seen in the Reserve Bank cash rate, simply not being passed on to the interest rates that small business is paying. Why is that? Why are small businesses in Australia being denied those interest rate decreases that the RBA has mandated? Why are they not being passed on to small business? Again that places Australian small business at a competitive disadvantage. If a small business in Australia is working on a tender in the Middle East, in America, in Europe or somewhere in Asia and they are competing against firms from those countries, those companies have access to finance from their banking systems at much lower rates than Australian exporters do from our banking system here. Why is that? I suggest there are three reasons. Firstly, under this government there has been such a blowout in the risk and such a deterioration in the conditions for small business that the banks are factoring that in and charging small business high rates. The alternative is that the banks are simply gouging small businesses with higher interest rates. The third explanation is a combination of the above. Therefore I have great concern over the wording of this bill when it talks about a market failure test for small businesses seeking finance, especially for their export activities. There is already a very strong case that market failure exists at the moment for a small business seeking finance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the principles of competitive neutrality, they are principles we should support, providing those markets are competitive. However, we have seen hypocrisy from the government in this respect, especially with what is known as the Community Energy Efficiency Program, because that program does not follow the principles of competitive neutrality. It is a program that is only available to local councils but it is not available to the small business community. One example of that is in the area of private swimming pools and swimming lessons. If a council owns a swimming pool at which it teaches kids to swim, it is entitled to seek to offset some of the higher electricity costs caused through the carbon tax by seeking a grant through the Community Energy Efficiency Program, but a small business competing against that locally run government institute cannot obtain that same grant. So here we have the government in this bill talking about the importance of competitive neutrality principles but doing the opposite in other directions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said previously, the coalition does not oppose this bill, but we must see how these changes affect it in principle. We must keep a very close eye on them because we do not want to see situations arise in this country where this government does a single thing more to place Australian small businesses at a greater competitive disadvantage than they already are with all the government's mistaken policies.</span>

                    </a>  In fact it is not a tax. It is a price on carbon and I am simply referring to the expression which you used, which is manifestly incorrect. In fact, the government has moved to link the carbon price with the carbon price being applied by close to 50 European countries. We will have exactly the same price as those 50 European countries, so it is simply absurd to run out the tired old chestnut that we are applying the world's highest carbon price.</span>

                    </a>  It is manifestly untrue.  Small- and medium-sized enterprises are indeed the engine room of job creation in this country and they will be the big winners following passage of this bill. In September 2011 the government commissioned the Productivity Commission to review Australia's export credit arrangements. Our response to the Productivity Commission's review, which was announced earlier this year, set out some adjustments to the mandate, the powers and the governance and financial arrangements of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. This bill implements those changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new mandate for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation will ensure that more of its resources are devoted to small- and medium-sized enterprises which face financial barriers to exporting. The bill also gives the EFIC new powers to enable it to better support Australian businesses participating in global and regional value change. Increasing participation in regional value change will result in increased specialisation and productivity as Australian companies move up the value chain focussing more on high value-added activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill forms part of a commitment in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the Asian Century</span> white paper to direct more of EFIC's resources to small- and medium-sized enterprises looking to expand into Asia and other emerging and frontier markets. EFIC already plays a valuable role in assisting exporters but these reforms will help it to keep pace with changes in the global economy, particularly through EFIC's improved ability to support Australian companies to integrate into regional value change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While EFIC's new focus will be on helping small- and medium-sized enterprises with their overseas endeavours, EFIC's mandate will not preclude it from supporting larger firms should they too face market failures, particularly when doing business in emerging and frontier markets. Through the introduction of a tax equivalent payment and debt neutrality charge or guarantee fee, the bill will also ensure that EFIC does not have a net competitive advantage over other businesses in the private sector. The bill will also remove the government member from EFIC's board. That will increase the board's independence from government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill will reorient EFIC's operations towards those small- and medium-sized exporters who face genuine market failures in accessing finance, particularly those businesses operating in frontier and emerging markets.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In getting around Australia in recent times I have been able to talk to a lot of small- and medium-sized enterprises who are doing well in terms of finding markets to which to export their products. They have been able to locate niche areas where quality counts for a great deal, where Australian branding counts for a great deal and is well received overseas, and they are doing well. You tend not to hear those stories. The stories that tend to make it onto the front pages of the media are about businesses closing their doors or laying off workers. Indeed, members of parliament often do not hear the good news stories because the businesses that are doing well do not have any cause to darken our doors, whereas those who are struggling may well seek to make contact with us. I can assure members here and people throughout the community more broadly that there are many Australian businesses that are doing extremely well with niche products, with high-end technology, with innovation and with good design, and they are taking advantage of Australia's reputation for quality and reliability.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Ms MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles1">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">11:17</span>):  The south-west of Western Australia produces some of the best food and wine in the nation. Members already know of the iconic Margaret River and Geographe wine regions, but they should also be aware of the fruit and vegetables, dairy products and beef and lamb which mark the south-west of Western Australia as one of Australia's finest and most efficient food producing regions. If you are not aware, perhaps you should come along to my South-West Sensations Showcase, to be held here at Parliament House on 18 June, where you will receive a taste of what the region has to offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To produce many of these products requires a workforce, and in many cases the workforce cannot be found locally. Agricultural areas in regional Australia might be areas of high production but they are not areas of high population. They often struggle to find workers in sufficient numbers. An obvious answer might seem to be to move Australians from areas of unemployment in our cities to the regions where the jobs are. But usually they will not go. So producers have for a generation had to source their workforce from overseas. There was no other choice. Many have sponsored workers on 457 visas in order to get their harvest done. Otherwise, you do not have a harvest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Backpackers have also contributed. They have filled fruit bins in Donnybrook, Manjimup, Busselton, Harvey and Margaret River for decades on their travels around Australia. However, backpackers alone are not the answer. Many arrive on farms unskilled and have to be taught the basics of picking. And then, having upskilled, they sometimes work for only a week or so before moving on. That is why a combination of short- and long-term workers is essential, and that is why access to 457 visa workers is vital to the rural industries. You only have to go out into my south-west to find out how vital they are. Talk to the growers. Ask them how they are able to actually get their crops. They will say to you it is only through a combination of backpackers and 457 visa holders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently there has been a surplus of backpacker workers in some areas, which, in conjunction with long-term staff, has assisted in taking some of the pressure off some producers. As soon as that happened, the Labor government jumped in—unfortunately—to make it harder again. Doubling the price of 457 visas from $450 to $900 is just another slap in the face for regional producers who feed the nation quality food. It is another example—as if we need it—of Labor's contempt, and I would say absolute contempt, for the farming, rural and regional communities. It is contempt. It is also another practical example—if we needed that—of budget mismanagement by the Gillard Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have the example of gross debt reaching $356 billion, requiring another blow-out in the nation's debt ceiling; and a net debt reaching $191 billion. We have a Labor Treasurer who promised a budget surplus this year but will deliver a $19 billion deficit. This Treasurer will never deliver a budget surplus. This was the Treasurer who promised that the budget last year would deliver a surplus this year on time, and surpluses the year after that, strengthening over time. The Treasurer also promised that the deficit years of the global recession were behind us and the surplus years were here. We are still waiting, Mr Treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at all this debt, deficit and broken promises and I think: was there some funding in all of that for the completion of the Bunbury Outer Ring Road? It is nearly two-thirds built. It is unfinished. The final stage was originally budgeted at $260 million. It is probably now over $300 million. That is an urgently needed piece of infrastructure that deserves state and federal funding support. This is a practical way the government could have assisted in my part of the world, right throughout this process; instead, we have seen nothing but waste and mismanagement, and debt and deficit, which will be the signature of this Labor government and its legacy to this nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83T" type="MemberSpeech1">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Mr RUDD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">11:22</span>):  I rise today to inform the parliament of the Liberal National Party's plans to privatise a number of school playing fields on Brisbane's south side. Unilaterally, the Liberal National Party government has announced that playing fields at Balmoral State High School and Whites Hill College will be sold off. There was not a word of consultation with local P&amp;Cs, who in previous decades have physically helped build these playing fields from nothing. There was not a word of consultation with the local community, whose local cricket teams and football teams use these fields regularly. There was not a word of consultation with the other local primary schools across Brisbane's south side, who also use these playing fields for their kids because in the inner southern suburbs there simply are not enough playing fields for the thousands of kids who use them and need to use them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only has there been no consultation but there is also no mandate from the people to flog off these playing fields at all. At no time prior to the last election did the Liberal National Party tell Brisbane south-side residents that they planned to privatise school playing fields. Not only is there no mandate, not only is there no consultation; there is no logic to this decision either. We all know when school populations go up and down. Local primary schools had small populations in my electorate 15 years ago. Now they are all bursting at the seams, without adequate playing fields. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is logical problem No. 1: school populations change. No. 2 is: once they are flogged off, no future government will ever be able to buy new playing fields in these inner-city suburbs because the real estate, nearly eight hectares in all, is just too expensive. Once they are gone, they are gone. No. 3 is: it is utter madness to be flogging off scarce green space on Brisbane's south side, given community demand and the rising local populations occurring through urban consolidation. These fields are part of the lungs of our city of Brisbane. No. 4 is: what about child obesity? All governments go on and on and on about child obesity, encouraging kids to play sports. We are doing that on the one hand and flogging off their playing fields on the other, which will encourage them to retreat to their dens and play on the computer instead. I do not think that is smart. In fact, I think it is downright dumb. This decision lacks logic on all four counts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far, more than 2,000 people have expressed their opposition to this heartless decision by signing my petition calling on the Liberal National Party government to reverse this short-sighted approach. Take Bruce, one of the petitioners, for example, who said: 'I teach in a local Catholic school, and on a number of occasions we have had the pleasure of using the Balmoral High School oval for our sports days. It is a great community asset used by many outside the school. For this reason, I believe it needs to be protected.' So a Brisbane south-side community is up in arms about this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been the response from the Liberal National Party? One local P&amp;C member wrote to the Liberal National Party member for Greenslopes. What was his response? 'Sorry, you have too much land.' That was it. What about the newly elected Liberal-National Party member for Bulimba? You would think he would be sympathetic. Don't bet on it! Mr Dillaway has told the Balmoral P&amp;C he fully supports the sale but, on top of that, tried to convince the P&amp;C that this decision had nothing to do with the government, it was an independent decision of the bureaucracy. Pigs might fly!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this to the Liberal National Party: local people are not easily fooled at all. This has been a running insult to our local community. Anyone with half a brain knows that when school playing fields are sold off the sale must get the tick-off of the minister concerned. In fact, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier-Mail</span> recently reported that the Liberal National Party member is one of many in the LNP party room who are staunch advocates of asset sales and think that the LNP government should go harder on asset sales. In fact, this local member does not think the LNP government has gone far enough. The Liberal National Party are treating Brisbane's south side with absolute contempt. They seem to think it is their land, not the community's land. Then there is the Liberal National Party candidate Mr Glasson. What is his position? The sounds of silence. Nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love my local community. I have lived there for 25 years. I love its schools; I know each and every one of them—all 63 of them—and the great work they do with our local kids. I am angered beyond description by this appallingly short-sighted decision by the Liberal National Party, state and federal, deeply wedded to their ideological agenda of privatising anything they can. I have news for the Liberal National Party; together with the local community we will fight these decisions with one objective: to get them overturned to keep these playing fields for future generations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">11:27</span>):  My comments today are slightly different from those of the member for Griffith, whom I follow, in that I am going to commend the federal government for one of its programs. I stand here today on the cusp of retirement after 23 years in federal parliament. I am grateful that one of the projects that will mark my final year in public life will be the facilitating of local commemorations for Australia's centenary of Anzac.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Fairfax, as in every other electorate across the nation, local communities are being assembled to provide authentic, grassroots input into a milestone of exceptional historical significance. This community involvement is a tried and tested blueprint that follows the admirable Australia Remembers 1945-1995 campaign model, which I also had the opportunity to contribute to. That was an initiative of a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from my own experiences in my electorate that there is an increasing willingness by communities to engage in events and activities that commemorate our Anzac past. I do not think Fairfax is unique in that regard. As the centenary of Anzac draws closer, this community momentum will build right across Australia as we collectively mark this milestone in our history. It is a milestone that is transcending its military origins. It is a milestone that also symbolises the attributes that define us as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Fairfax the centenary local grants committee brings together a dedicated group of community members who have willingly volunteered their time and energy. They have accepted their task with vigour and determination to ensure that sincere homage is paid to those who have served and sacrificed for our country and to those who continue to do so. I look forward to the outcomes of their efforts. Local resident the Reverend Ian Taylor, who is 86 years young with an exemplary military, missionary and chaplaincy record, is our committee chair. Time has not wearied his enthusiasm for community service. I have known Reverend Taylor for many years and have advocated for his selection in Gallipoli delegations, so far without success. But I am still hopeful for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been through my association with the reverend that another of my constituents, Marj Cheek, has sharpened my appreciation of Anzac privileges. Marj shares not only a year of birth with the Reverend Taylor but also an aspiration to visit the shores of Gallipoli. For Marj, the motivation is highly personal and emotional. Her father served there. Marge's father is in a painting hanging in the War Memorial which depicts a scene from the trenches of Gallipoli. I hope both Reverend Taylor and Marj Cheek realise their Gallipoli goals. I also hope that many other direct descendants like Marj have the opportunity to attend the 2015 ceremony on the sacred site.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Anzac legend was born from incredible human courage and sacrifice. I appreciate there has to be a process in place to best manage the Anzac Day centenary commemoration at Gallipoli. But, generations on, I hope that those most deserving of their ticket for this once-in-a-lifetime event do not become modern-day casualties of the ballot.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to raise an issue that was covered by the budget which disappoints me greatly—that is, the decision by the government to close the Australian embassy in Budapest in Hungary. People here know that I was born in Hungary. There are 100,000 Hungarians living in Australia. They have a very active embassy in Budapest. When the member for Griffith was running around the world trying to get countries to support him in his endeavours for a seat on the Security Council for Australia, Hungary was one of only three European countries which supported Australia in that successful endeavour. I ask Senator Bob Carr, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to reconsider that decision. Downsize the embassy by all means if we need to save money but do not abandon the embassy in Hungary and those Hungarian people in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">11:32</span>):  There can be no more important public discourse on human rights than that associated with the death penalty and the lives of our citizens. The right to life is a fundamental human right recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 as well as in the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights 1966. This year will be the 65th anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration, an occasion to acknowledge and recommit ourselves to the principles it stands for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time we should stand as a nation, particularly for the rights of Australian citizens Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, currently on death row in Bali, Indonesia. They have both been on death row for the last seven years and are just a stroke of a pen away from execution. Their situation was recently made worse with the Indonesian government's target of executing 10 condemned persons per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009 I was a part of setting up the cross-party working group on the death penalty, co-convened by my colleagues Senator Humphries and Senator Hanson-Young. The group was about promoting the abolitionist position in relation to capital punishment as well as specifically addressing matters involving Australian citizens on death row. I also undertook a study visit to Indonesia in 2011. I visited Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in Kerokoban prison along with Scott Rush, another young Australian who was at that stage on death row but who has fortunately had his sentence commuted since. While I was there, each of them spoke to me about their daily struggles and the prospect of being executed at any time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever one might feel about the crimes Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran committed, it is impossible not to feel for them as human beings and also feel for their families. I would like to make it very clear that we all condemn the menacing world of drug-related crime. I also note the difficult and commendable job that the Indonesian police do, along with their Australian counterparts, in doing everything they can to target not only drug crime but the effects that drugs have on our community. However, in a civil world the principle of punishment is that the punishment should fit the crime. After all, it is the heart of our judicial system and, as I understand it, it is also the central tenet of the Indonesian criminal justice system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My views against capital punishment became even stronger after a chance encounter with the parents of Scott Rush many years ago. As parents of three children, Bernadette and I really felt for Lee and Christine Rush in having not only a child on death row but the uncertainty of everything associated with that and simply relying on prayers and good conscience of all those who support their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak today not just in pursuit of what I regard as a genuine human rights issue but also as a parent who holds the strong view that, regardless of what our children might do, nothing extinguishes the love and care we have for our kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, I would like to leave you with words of former Chief Justice of the Constitution Court in South Africa, Ismail Mahomed, in speaking about the death penalty:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">… is the ultimate and the most incomparably extreme form of punishment … It is the last, the most devastating and the most irreversible recourse of the criminal law involving … the planned and calculated termination of life itself; the destruction of the greatest and most precious gift which is bestowed on all humankind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice Mahomed went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not necessarily only the dignity of the person being executed that is invaded. Very arguably, the dignity of all of us in a caring civilisation must be compromised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage all members to take an interest in the current position in Indonesia in respect of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran and whatever efforts members can make to make their intentions known about the death penalty would be appreciated.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles1">The Nationals Chief Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">11:37</span>):  I would like to raise two issues in the debate this morning. Firstly, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the situation that the Life Skills organisation in Mudgee find themselves in. Life Skills is a day care and respite centre for disabled people in the Mudgee mid-western area. At the moment they are operating from a house in Mudgee. A couple of weeks ago the mayor of the mid-western council, Des Kennedy, along with the state member for Orange, Andrew Gee, and my neighbour Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, visited the Life Skills organisation. They were absolutely appalled at the conditions that they were operating under.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only were the clients there working in very cramped and not very amenable conditions but the staff conditions were such that they were even using a portaloo in the backyard. In this day and age, caring for people with a disability in circumstances such as those is not acceptable. I will be working with my state colleague and, hopefully, with the assistance of the state minister Andrew Constance and the cooperation of the federal government, to try to reverse the situation that Life Skills Mudgee find themselves in. They have found another venue that they can move to—the ex-Harvey Norman premises in South Mudgee—which will be very suitable. I state now that I will be doing everything I can to make sure that they can make that move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to remind the House that this year marks 10 years since country legend Slim Dusty passed away. It was a move afoot to make 13 June as the official National Slim Dusty Day and I endorse that. Quite a few A-list celebrities, including Keith Urban, Nicole Kidman, Kasey Chambers, Lee Kernaghan, Shane Nicholson, Ray Hadley, Dick Smith, Beccy Cole and Adam Harvey are all behind this proposal. Indeed, Slim Dusty's wife, Joy McKean, also supports the idea. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be of great interest to the member opposite: on 13 June at the Rooty Hill RSL there will be a large concert to mark Slim's birthday and to start raising funds for the Slim Dusty museum at Kempsey. I raise the issue that Slim Dusty is an icon of legend in Australia, particularly for the people of the Parkes electorate. I represent one of the largest Aboriginal populations anywhere in Australia in this place. There is great affection in the Aboriginal community for Slim Dusty. Slim Dusty is one of the few top artists who took the time to travel to Aboriginal communities, to the regional areas, to deliver his brand of music to those people. I have been a Slim Dusty fan since I can remember. The very first record that our family owned when we bought a radiogram prior to TV—and that is dating me a little—was a Slim Dusty record. As my family know, I have requested that when I pass from this earth there is a particular Slim Dusty song that I want played at my funeral.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This might sound frivolous but it is not: Slim Dusty is by far the most prolific recording artist that this country has ever seen. I think he recorded something like 110 or so albums. He is without peer. More than anyone else, in his music he explained the psyche of the bush. He clearly understood what made people tick in Australia and his songs reflect that. Time prohibits me to go on to some of my favourite Slim Dusty songs, but I would encourage everyone to get behind the push to make 13 June national Slim Dusty Day and I would encourage my colleague opposite to attend the Rooty Hill RSL on 13 June to show his support for this wonderful cause.</span>

                  <a href="HVY" type="MemberSpeech1">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech1">Ms SAFFIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate1">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time1">11:42</span>):  Before I start on the contribution I am here to make, I want to give my absolute support to the honourable member for Parkes's proposal to make 13 June national Slim Dusty Day. I wish to put on the record a statement I have prepared on the state of the beef industry and specifically its representative bodies. I have called it 'Beef bodies fail farmers'. After a decade of stagnant farm gate prices, despite a billion dollars of farmers' and taxpayers' money being paid to industry bodies, beef producers are demanding a restructure of their industry to safeguard Australia's food security, secure better farm gate prices and to take advantage of growing demand from developing markets—and China is notably one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beef producers, processors and exporters pay $5 per head to the Meat and Livestock Australia, MLA, every time an animal changes hands—totalling $96 million in revenue from members' levies—and received $44.5 million in 2010 alone from the federal government for R&amp;D projects. That is more than $1 billion in compulsory levies paid in the last decade, yet producers feel the MLA and the Cattle Council of Australia, CCA, have failed to utilise the levies to their meaningful advantage. They highlight estimates that supermarkets increased retail beef prices by 50 per cent between 2000 and 2010, but cattle prices remained unchanged and margins eroded over the same time frame. Producers say MLA, the association that undertakes R&amp;D and marketing on their behalf, does not effectively represent members' interests, their interests, and it lacks transparency and accountability in the way it apportions members' levies and inadequately reports R&amp;D results. Producers also perceive that the Cattle Council of Australia, the peak council that is supposed to advise and in some way have some oversight of the MLA, is compromised because it relies in part on some MLA funding and lacks an effective executive board able to adequately advise on the strategic direction of R&amp;D marketing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that Australia has no adequate domestic meat-grading system in a climate of declining beef consumption suggests another obvious failure of the MLA and CCA to provide advantage to producers. According to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences, domestic consumption per capita declined from 41.3 kilograms in 1997 to under 33 kilograms in 2011. Industry sources estimate that 30 to 40 per cent of beef sold in Australian supermarkets comes from old cattle, and that consumer dissatisfaction with this poor-quality beef is a contributor to the decline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since cattle producers receive little difference in price for old cows or young steers, there is currently little reward for producing top-quality meats: so says Norman Hunt from the Australian Meat Producers Group. With Chinese imports of Australian beef up 250 per cent in 2012 on the previous year, and set to keep rising, producers also lack the assurance that the MLA has sufficiently anticipated issues that could adversely affect market share. They recognise the MLA's weakness in this regard after its failure to work effectively with countries that import live Australian cattle to develop humanitarian approaches to slaughtering, despite millions of levy payers' dollars spent developing these markets: $25 million were spent developing the South-East Asian beef market from 2005 to 2011, as reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> on 15 November 2011.</span>
