                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this motion is to enable the final consideration and passage this week of the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. As honourable senators are aware, that is the government bill that is currently being debated by the chamber, but it does appear from the state of the speakers list that, unless there were to be an accommodation and a variation, there is no practical possibility that the native title bill could be finally dealt with and disposed of this week. As we know, if the bill is not dealt with this week, then the soonest it can be finally dealt with and passed is in the week commencing on Tuesday, 13 June—that is, in more than a month's time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge that Senator Dodson, in his contribution on the second reading debate yesterday, made it clear that the Labor Party would support the bill and support the government amendments to the bill, and that has been confirmed as well by the shadow Attorney-General, who is the shadow minister responsible for the bill on behalf of the opposition, Mr Dreyfus. So we are not now discussing whether or not the bill should be passed. We are not dealing with the merits. We are dealing with whether or not the bill should be disposed of or finally dealt with this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We ask the opposition's support in relation to this, because the opposition has made it very clear, as recently as a letter sent to me by the shadow Attorney-General overnight, that its position was that it would facilitate the swift passage of the bill in this sittings. Those are Mr Dreyfus's words, repeated on several occasions—that the opposition will facilitate the swift passage of the bill in this sittings. As honourable senators know, there are only three sitting weeks in this sitting period, because the fortnight that would otherwise be a sitting fortnight is devoted to estimates. Of those three sitting weeks, two of them are short weeks—this week and the next sitting week, which does not begin until Tuesday 13 June. So the government's position is very simple: if the opposition is going to be faithful to its undertaking to the government to facilitate the swift passage of the bill in this sitting period, the swift passage of the bill means dealing with the bill as soon as practicably possible. The government listed this bill for debate yesterday, as government item of business No. 2. We have begun the debate, but because of the number of senators who wish to participate it will not be possible to dispose of the bill today unless there are additional hours. So the government is proposing that if—and only if—the bill is not finally dealt with today, the Senate sit tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the decision of the Federal Court in the McGlade case—which this bill seeks to deal with the consequences of—came down on 2 February this year, we have been urged, in particular by the Indigenous leadership of the country, to deal with this matter as a matter of urgency, and we have. We introduced a bill into the House of Representatives to deal with it only a fortnight after the McGlade decision came down, and it passed through the House of Representatives on the last sitting day of the previous sitting period. There has been extensive consultation during the Easter recess, including a very large stakeholder consultation meeting on 27 May attended by the opposition, including Senator Dodson. So we are discharging our commitment to native title holders to deal with the matter as a matter of urgency, as they have requested us to do; we ask the opposition to keep their promise to facilitate the swift passage of the bill.</span>

The opposition is not intending to support the suspension. Firstly, these matters of native title have a long history of important and sometimes difficult debate, in this chamber particularly—probably before most of us were here—and throughout the Australian community. We believe that native title needs to be dealt with with care, with consideration and with due consultation with Indigenous Australians, because this goes to their land rights, their property rights, their human rights and their personal rights. The opposition has been seeking to work constructively with the government on this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to give some history about this, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017 makes significant changes to the Native Title Act. We do not believe that it should be rushed through the Senate. I make the point that the government guillotined debate on 16 February this year. Debate on the bill only commenced in the Senate yesterday, and only three speakers have spoken to the bill. The opposition has made clear, time and time again, that we are willing to work with the government in relation to amendments and in order to ensure not only the passage but also the proper form of this legislation. The fact is, this bill was pushed through the House without debate. The government then only allowed a single day for a Senate committee to conduct hearings into the bill. This was despite 61 organisations and individuals making thoughtful and detailed submissions on the bill. That committee's work identified many deficiencies in the bill, and there have been multiple rounds of amendments with limited consultation on them. The last amendments were provided to the opposition on—I think—Monday night, and then there were amendments to those amendments, as I recall, on Tuesday night. If the Attorney is concerned about the delay on this, frankly, he should look at his own competence, because presenting multiple rounds of amendments, and amendments to amendments, on the days you are seeking to pass a bill is no way to conduct negotiations, or to conduct discussion and consultation on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the assertion as to what commitment was made, the correspondence from the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow assistant minister for Indigenous affairs and the shadow Attorney-General was very clear. We said, 'Subject to those amendments being drafted appropriately and proper consultation taking place, Labor stands ready to work with the government to enable the swift passage of this legislation in the next sitting of the parliament,' which is obviously the winter sitting, which commenced on Tuesday, 9 May and concludes on the 22nd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the government has frankly mishandled the consultation and amendment process—including some amendments being drafted in the Attorney's office itself, I am advised, which is an odd way to conduct these matters—it now wishes to upend the Senate and demand that we continue to sit tomorrow. This is after the government itself putting different legislation on first, as people might recall. The minister, Senator Cash, as she is entitled to, chose to engage in quite a lengthy debate on the PaTH legislation. Yesterday when Senator Ludlam moved a 74(5) motion, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Senator O'Sullivan, frankly, took the bait. That is fine. Senator Ludlam is entitled as a Green to move something, but they took the bait and had a long debate. Now they want us to fix it up by staying here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition have said we will cooperate. We will give up some general business time. We can finalise the actual content of the debate. It will mean that the final vote would have to be held in the June sittings—we accept that. But in terms of certainty we have made clear our agreement to the bill by a public statement—Senator Dodson's contribution to this chamber, as well as the shadow Attorney-General's contribution. So I think the certainty is clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to make this point—because I can see Senator Canavan preparing his notes and I am sure the Greens will speak. I really object to the way in which native title is being used as a proxy for the Adani debate. I really object to it—on both sides. Native title is too important to be used for those frankly base political purposes by both the Greens and the National Party.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  For me, that was a particularly unconvincing contribution about why we cannot deal with this urgent issue now, this week, and not delay it for another four weeks. It was unconvincing because Senator Wong got some simple facts wrong. We are not seeking in this motion to establish a guillotine or a gag on debate. We are seeking to have enough time to deal with this issue, which the National Native Title Council itself has said is a matter of urgency. We are responding to their needs, their wants and their issues, to make sure this is dealt with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree, Senator Wong—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—that this is a matter of sensitivity. This is a matter we should deal with properly, and that is why we are saying: let's have sufficient time to deal with it this week so we do not delay it another four weeks. This is a test for the Labor Party. It is a test of whether they support the interests of traditional owners and our First Australians. Do they support jobs for them and other Australians as well?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need this bill. The reason this bill is urgent is that hundreds of Indigenous land use agreements across Australia are contingent on the clarity and consistency of native title law. As the Attorney-General said in his contribution, that has been called into question because of a court case earlier this year. We agree that that is an issue. We all agree on the changes, in my understanding. We all agree, after the Senate committee inquiry, that it should go through. So what is stopping us hanging around for one more day for our First Australians, to say that they can have a future as well? The Labor Party's position here is: 'We can't change our flights. We can't have a night in Canberra for your interests and your views. We will have to wait another four weeks.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also object. This is not about the Adani project alone. This is about 123 Indigenous land use agreements that have been called into question. This is about the people of the East Kimberley who want the Ord expansion to occur, who want that land to be developed. That needs an Indigenous land use agreement that could potentially be called into question. We want Project Sea Dragon to occur in the Northern Territory, an aquaculture project that could create 1,500 jobs there, in an area of our country that is of low-socioeconomic disadvantage. We want the bauxite mining of the cape to expand as well. Some of the first Indigenous land use agreements were made by the Wik and Wik Way peoples there. They need to be set in stone. They need to be given certainty as well. Why can't we give them certainty?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this also is about the Adani Carmichael mine project. That is a project that could also deliver thousands of jobs to Indigenous Australians and other Australians. This is something that the traditional owners of the land there want, and that does not get said enough down here—that the Indigenous landowners met last year in Maryborough and voted 293 to one in favour of the Adani Carmichael coalmine. If we cannot spend another night in Canberra for them, we are insulting those 293 First Australians who want this project to go ahead, who just want the same opportunities and jobs that we in this place all enjoy. Why can't we extend that generosity to them as well? It does not stop there. This project also means jobs and benefits for all Australians. Last week we saw that Adani will use Australian steel and Australian steel only in their rail line. That will help protect jobs at the other end of the country, in Whyalla, South Australia, where they produce Australian steel. They will be one of the few mining companies in this country to use Australian steel in their project. In the Pilbara it does not happen, in Central Queensland it does not happen, but it will happen at the Carmichael mine. They will use Australian steel and protect Australian jobs in our manufacturing sector too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is stopping the Australian Labor Party from supporting those jobs, supporting traditional owners and having one more night in Canberra? What is stopping them doing that? What is stopping them spending a little bit more time here to get this done now and respond to those urgent needs? If they cannot do that and if they cannot support this, I do not want to hear any comments about jobs from the opposition leader, Mr Shorten, tonight in his budget reply. I do not want to hear him talk about jobs tonight, because it is clear here today that the opposition do not support jobs if they do not support this motion. We saw earlier this week what the Labor Party think about jobs in the ad that they put out. They think about jobs for some but not all Australians, and certainly not for Australians of colour. If they did support jobs for all Australians, they would support this motion. They will support hanging around for another day, for a little bit longer, to deal with a matter we actually all agree on. We actually agree on this. Let us just get together and make sure it happens for our First Australians.</span>

That is what this is about. They have finally come out and said really clearly, 'We want this rushed through so we can ram through the Adani mine.' That is what it is about. Senator Canavan has just said, 'Yes, we should be supporting the claimants,' when he knows very well there is a court case going on about this right now. So there are a whole lot of native title claimants that do not support that decision. That is what the court case is about. This government is trying to ram this bill through so it can support its mates in getting their dirty coalmine up and running. It is not about any native title claimants; it is about that mine. If the government were really concerned about native title, they would ensure there was enough time to debate this bill, to have a proper look at it so that all native title claimants around Australia could actually participate in this debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, we got delivered to us yet another amendment to this bill which actually raises very, very significant issues around some of the agreements on Cape York—very significant issues around those claims. That was just put on the table for us yesterday. What the government wants to do is rush this through without us being able to properly interrogate those very significant issues that are raised and without giving native title claimants the ability to participate. And it is not just current native title claimants that have a role in consultations here; every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person needs to be engaged in this discussion about the future of native title. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been very clear that we do not want to rush this bill through, because it has very significant ramifications for so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We have been very clear about that. We have been very clear—and I was clear yesterday in my second reading contribution on this—that we are aware of the significant issues that the McGlade case raises. There is absolutely no doubt about that. But the amendment that was brought in yesterday raises a whole heap of new issues. I thank the Attorney-General for ensuring that we got a briefing yesterday morning on this; I do acknowledge that. But, for me, it raises a whole lot of issues, and I have had an opportunity to again discuss some of these issues very quickly since that time with stakeholders. I met with some native title claimants and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who have a view on this, and they are very concerned that this bill may be rushed through this place. The government is not listening to that broader number of groups. We will. </span>

Native title claimants should have a longer opportunity to comment on the ramifications of the amendments that the government want to rush through this place—because that is what they want to do, without considering what those ramifications are.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are some concerns about the amendment that was raised yesterday, or about the issues that are raised by the amendment that was raised yesterday. We need time to be able to check that information, because at the moment all we have had is a briefing on this issue. But the government do not care about that. They do not care about addressing those issues that were raised, or about allowing people to address those issues that were raised by that amendment. They want to rush this through so Adani can go ahead with their dirty coalmine that will ruin the future of the reef. It does not provide the multiple thousands of jobs that the government say it will, and that has been knocked on the head so many times. But, like they do all the time, they go ahead with their alternative facts. Don't worry about what the future actually is or the fact that it will destroy so many tourism jobs on the Great Barrier Reef! They are absolutely blind to that. They want to help their big business mates ram this through. That is what these changes are about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government really cared about native title, they would have started addressing this issue when representative bodies brought it up a number of years ago—to absolute deafness from the government. They have done nothing. But all of a sudden Adani might be at risk, and now we have to rush it through here, trampling on people's ability to be consulted, not caring a jot about any other native title claimants. They care about only the mine, and they are using native title claimants to drive their argument. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:52</span>):  I want to read, for Senator Siewert's benefit, from a letter the National Native Title Council wrote to the Attorney on 5 May. In case Senator Siewert is not aware, I will quote from the second paragraph of the letter first, just to indicate who the Native Title Council are. The letter says: 'As you are aware, the National Native Title Council is the peak body and alliance of NTRBs and NTSPs from across the country. NTRBs and NTSPs themselves provide native title services to traditional owners, as set out in the Native Title Act. As such, NTRBs and NTSPs represent the overwhelming majority of the many traditional owners who are affected by the recent McGlade decision.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The letter goes on at some length, and I am sure Senator Siewert has seen this letter, but I just want to quote this one simple paragraph. Page 3 of the letter says, 'The NNTC urges the parliament to consider and pass this bill as soon as possible.' As well as that, I remind the Senate that the Attorney met with 15 different native title councils involved in this issue on 27 April, and every single one of them agreed and urged that this legislation be passed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the Labor Party, who are clearly playing games on this issue simply to try and solve the deep divide in the Labor Party between those who want Adani and those who do not. I speak particularly to the Queensland Labor senators: your Labor Party state government desperately wants this bill passed. Why? It means jobs for Indigenous people, it means Indigenous people will have their wishes respected and it means 10,000 jobs in Central and North Queensland, an area where unemployment is rife. Not often do I agree with the Queensland Labor government, and not often do I agree with Premier Palaszczuk, but in this instance she is absolutely correct. This is desperately needed for Queensland. It is essential for Queensland. I want the Queensland Labor senators here to stand up to the rest of their group, who want to delay this and hopefully join with the Greens in preventing Adani—that wonderful proposal which will mean real jobs for Indigenous people. That is why the local traditional owners in the Galilee Basin totally support this. They gave evidence before my committee, which had a very full one-day hearing on this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that, everybody who had an interest in this particular legislation came before that committee, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, and made their views known, and the committee made recommendations to support this. The support was unanimous, providing we addressed certain amendments which the Labor Party suggested and which were adopted by the government in a number of meetings. The committee has heard all the evidence and has read all the submissions. Sure, there are some that did not agree, mainly those that were sponsored by the Greens, who will do anything to stop any job in Australia. But this committee looked at the evidence very carefully, saw a couple of things that needed to be addressed and made recommendations accordingly, and the government took up those recommendations. I thank Senator Dodson and those in the Labor Party who have contributed to this. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this refusal to sit on a Friday, just because Labor Party people might have parties to go to somewhere tomorrow, is outrageous. I hope that the Queensland Labor Premier has someone listening to this, and I hope she gets on the telephone and says to the Labor Party Queensland senators, 'Get real; get this passed,' because it is so important to the Queensland government, currently led by the Labor Party in Annastacia Palaszczuk. Please, Premier Palaszczuk, get onto your Labor senators from Queensland and make them sit tomorrow. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  Let me make it very clear to this House that this debate on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017 is about native title rights, not mining rights. Calls by the senator on the other side about ILUAs are completely false. The government claim that this bill must be passed this week to avoid legal calamities for existing ILUAs is totally unsound. Registered ILUAs remain valid unless successfully challenged in court. While there may be potential for some registered ILUAs to be challenged because they do not comply with the requirements of the law established in the McGlade decision, no such challenge has been mounted in the over three months since that decision.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no rush for this debate. This must be debated in a respectful manner. It is 25 years next month since the late Eddie Mabo fought for land rights, for native title rights, in this country. There has been absolutely no respect in this current process for the traditional owners of this country, for the Noongar people of WA or for native title holders across the country. You on the other side say that you have spoken to Indigenous leaders, but you did not get there without Senator Patrick Dodson. It is Labor who has had to drag you every step of the way to consult, to discuss and to work with native title holders across the country, and you still have not done that adequately. So we will not rush this bill; we will talk about it in the manner appropriate for examination by this house, and we will do that when we need to do that. Another thing is amendment after amendment has been put through by the other side at last-minute intervals, giving no time for people to inspect this in the Senate. The Greens stand up, with every right, in the Senate to say that they have not seen the Cape York Land Council amendments. We have not heard from other senators—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. This is an important debate for the first nations people in this country. Please show greater respect. Senator Macdonald, in your commentary yesterday, you raised in this house that there were more amendments to be made to the Native Title Act. We have not even seen any of those discussions or had any discussions about that, so what are those amendments that you plan to bring on in the coming months? Why aren't we having this properly scrutinised? Why does it have to be done in secrecy? Why are you going back, bringing another amendment and then wanting us to say, 'Yes, yes, yes'? The people of Australia do not even know what you are doing, because you are not allowing the Senate the proper and adequate process of scrutinising this legislation. It is a disgrace. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at Parliament House last night at the National Indigenous Human Rights Awards with Bonita Mabo and Gail Mabo. How appropriate is it that their presence was right here in the building at the time of this debate?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not going to rush this. My colleagues on this side want this done in an appropriate manner for all stakeholders, all parties, who are involved in this. The role of the Senate is to scrutinise properly and effectively, and we need to do that. But you on the other side, as usual, are always rushing us. How many traditional owners have you on the other side gone out and spoken to? How many senators on the other side have spoken to first nations people and said, 'Have a look at this Cape York Land Council amendment'? How about: 'Have a look at this other amendment; do you know what that means'? How many of you on the other side have actually gone out there and done that? Of the 126 ILUAS that exist, name one. Can any of you on that side name any of them, because this Senate needs to know all about those ILUAs. You can't, can you? And here you are wanting to make a piece of legislation to amend a profound act—an important act—and making sure we all have our hands tied behind our backs so all we can say is, 'Yes.' Let me tell you: it is not going to happen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  The Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business better access to justice. Labor wants to empower small business private litigants to bring litigation under part 4 of the Competition and Consumer Act without the burden of prohibitive legal fees. This bill represents a policy that we took to the last election. Since its inception the Trade Practices Act 1974, now the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, has had section 46. This is a key component of Australia's competition laws. It is designed to prevent firms with substantial market power from deliberately using that power to eliminate or substantially damage a competitor, prevent the entry of a competitor or to deter or prevent competition. Businesses have the legal right to take action under section 46 if a competitor is engaged in anticompetitive conduct. However, at the moment this is hard for small and medium-size businesses to do, even when there is a clear breach of our competition laws. We all know that the larger players have the money, the lawyers and the capacity to fight these cases. In some instances they have an incentive to drag these cases out. Even where the small business has a strong case they worry that if they lose or if they have to fold they could face huge legal bills. This means that smaller players are discouraged from taking action to enforce Australia's competition laws and, through this, they are discouraged from accessing justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a concern that there is an uneven playing field between large and small businesses in Australia. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has taken action in this space, although it has been suggested that this is insufficient relative to the number of allegations. The issue is addressed by the Harper competition review, which found small business access to remedies to be wanting, stating:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From submissions and consultations with small business, the Panel is convinced that there are significant barriers to small business taking private action to enforce the competition laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will address the difficulties small businesses face in getting justice under Australia's competition law. It does this by two measures. First, it allows judges in the Federal Court to waive liability for costs to small business private litigants bringing these cases. We know that all too often small businesses do not take the big end of town to task, despite the fact that they may have a strong case. This is simply because they cannot afford to risk the costs of going to court, especially when their cash flow is already tight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the chamber want to make sure that small and medium businesses are on the same level playing field in our justice system as big business. This bill will do exactly that. It will be up to the judge whether a no adverse costs order is warranted. This empowers the small business owner with the knowledge that they will be able to argue their case without fear of a huge legal bill at the conclusion. If the application is not approved, they can then make a decision knowing that they are proceeding at their own risk. Either way, they will have greater up-front knowledge and certainty about the impact of proceeding with the competition case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second element of the bill is that small businesses will be able to go to the Ombudsman to get early assistance to find out whether they should consider going for these new no adverse costs order. The legislation would allow the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be granted. This is to assist in the process of a private litigant requesting a no adverse costs order. While this will not be legally binding, the ombudsman will assist small businesses to better understand their prospects of successful action under the Competition and Consumer Act. The small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell has commented on this bill. She has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding anti-competitive behaviour, the ASBFEO office remains committed to ensuring small businesses have every opportunity to compete on a level playing field. Labor's proposal regarding a 'no adverse costs order' has merit, and deserves serious consideration by all sides of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents a practical change for small businesses and is in the public interest. By allowing private litigants to better bring action under the Competition and Consumer Act, anticompetitive behaviour by powerful interests will be better mitigated, helping to support Australia's competition policy framework. This is a sensible proposal to provide some support for small businesses without damaging competition in the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike some other international jurisdictions, competition litigation in Australia is primarily by public in nature. In the United States, about 10 private cases are brought for each public case. In Australia, the ratio is about one private case for every three public cases. There are certainly a number of disincentives to bringing private litigation under the Competition and Consumer Act. The primary consideration is the potential liability of opposing costs, in the situation where an applicant loses a case. When the misuse of market power is considered, the opposing costs are likely to be large given the reliance on solicitors and barristers, as well as competition experts. Further, defendants in these types of cases tend to be both wealthy and powerful. This is distinct from litigants who, given the nature of their grievance, tend to be less powerful. We think this bill is an important step to improving competition, strengthening enforcement of our competition laws and giving small business greater access to justice. We think this is an area where enabling small and medium businesses to take action here would lead to a more competitive economy, more opportunities for small business and better outcomes for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some have linked an effects test to this bill. Labor is opposed to the effects test. However, we know that other parties in this chamber have a different position on it. This bill is separate from the effects test. It ensures that when action is taken under Australia's competition laws, the playing field is more even between small and large businesses. I want to make it clear that this is a measure that both those in favour of the effects test and those against the effects test can support. This bill simply allows better access to competition laws for small and medium businesses. Labor certainly support strong competition policy; however, we are opposed to an effects test because we have serious concerns about its impact on competition. 'Effects test' is shorthand for a test that looks at whether conduct engaged in by a firm with a substantial degree of market power has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. This is dangerous economic policy. In our view, the effects test creates a legal risk for a business every time it seeks to lower prices for its customers. We believe that consumers are the losers under the effects test. The effects test risks making businesses afraid to compete, which ultimately, in the long run, hurts consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many inquiries into Australia's competition laws. Since 1974 at least 10 inquiries have considered the proposal of an effects test and have rejected it. Apart from Professor Harper's review, only one other inquiry has ever recommended it. In submissions to the Harper review, the effects test has been described as 'legally unworkable', something that 'will chill competition' and something that 'will create uncertainty for business'. We believe that it will deter investment by adding new layers of red tape and will not help competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that this bill is a better approach to competition law, by making sure that small and medium businesses have greater access to justice, and are not discouraged from taking action under our competition laws where they have a good case. However, as I have said, the access to justice policy in this bill is distinct from the effects test. It can be supported by those in favour of the effects test—the government's position—and by those opposed to the effects test. It complements the competition laws in Australia by allowing greater access to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that small businesses make up 97 per cent of businesses in Australia and they are the engine room of the economy. They employ almost five million people and contribute in excess of $343 billion to the economy every year. This scale simply cannot be ignored. That is why we would have liked to have seen Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison put more of a focus on small and medium businesses in this budget instead of focusing on the big end of town. Small businesses are crucial to Australia's economy, and the budget that we have just seen confirms that the priority for this government is very much the big end of town over those working hard to grow their businesses and to create more jobs in their communities. When small businesses receive the support they need then they are able to grow, which in turn creates jobs and allows them to contribute more to the national economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, from our point of view, this budget is a missed opportunity. It has not addressed some of the most significant issues for small business. For example, it has not addressed issues including rising energy costs, delays in payments times and the delays in the rollout of the NBN. These are issues that are consistently and constantly raised with me by small businesses across Australia. We did welcome the decision to extend for one year the small business instant asset write-off. However, we are disappointed that the government has not acted to stimulate jobs or growth or to address the all-important issue of cash flow for businesses. Waiting for payments for supplies or services delivered is debilitating for small businesses right across Australia, and this budget, from my reading of it, has made no effort to address the 'payment terms' problem exposed in the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's recent report into the practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to compete in a global economy, small businesses need access to high-speed internet to grow their business and sell their products. But, again, this budget provides no solutions for Malcolm Turnbull's substandard National Broadband Network. This inaction simply makes it inevitable that Australian small businesses will continue to struggle with one of the slowest and most expensive internet services in the developed world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also leaves small businesses to fend for themselves on increasing energy prices. We have seen a complete absence of leadership from the top of this government on energy policy. This has a real impact on small businesses. In the last six months it has been mentioned to me at almost every meeting I have had with small business. As the contracts that they have to enter into for the next three years or so arrive, some businesses have raised with me the prospect that their annual energy bill is going from, say, $20,000 a year to $90,000 a year. I do not know how the government expects small businesses to absorb that kind of increase in a year. There is no response to this from the government. The lack of any consistent national policy, move to an emissions intensity scheme or investment certainty that is required around renewables is a policy void that is impacting on small businesses. They are raising it with me. They are extremely concerned and they want to see a response from the government, and it was absent in this year's budget. Wholesale power prices have doubled under this budget, and it looks like small businesses and households will continue to have to pay the price for this government's head-in-the-sand approach to delivering a national energy policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us today is all about levelling the playing field when it comes to access to justice for small business. We have consulted on this bill. It was a policy that we took to the last election. My predecessor in this position, Michelle Rowland, consulted heavily on this with a range of small-business stakeholders. Since taking up this portfolio, I too have met with not just industry associations but small and medium business owners themselves to talk through Labor's policy in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that, at the small business level, the effects test itself has not been raised with me as a top priority. On the issue of creating a level playing field—this perception, rightly, and wrongly at times perhaps, that small business does not get treated fairly is certainly one that is alive and thriving in the small business community, and I think there is a lot of merit to that argument. There is no doubt that small businesses want to see some improvements to the legislation around creating a level playing field, and the feedback that we have got from stakeholders of this bill supports it. Even those stakeholders who support the effects test also want to see this legislation get through; they see it as complementary too. And, for those that support an effects test, it is not necessarily an either/or scenario. We believe that this is the best way to go, and we do not support an effects test, which is why we have developed this legislation to deal with the issue of a level playing field and have that debate here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, small businesses think access to justice is a difficulty for them, as well as the affordability of access to justice, which is why this bill goes particularly to that point. Many have raised with me examples of where they would have considered pursuing legal action or just taking legal advice, but the costs of that and the risks to their business resulted in them deciding to just cop it, ignore it or move on. That is exactly what this bill tries to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been very concerning stories around small-business loans, for example, This has come up across my portfolio into financial services, and small-business loans are something that I think we need to do further work on. We note that there is an initiative in the budget around a streamlined complaints mechanism which will allow small-business complaints, particularly about their loan arrangements, to be considered. We are having a look at the detail of that over the next few days and we will have some questions about it at estimates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is no doubt that there have been some extremely concerning stories about small businesses doing all the right things, meeting their loan obligations, making all their repayments, and then quite unfairly losing their businesses because of the actions of particular banks. I have spent a fair bit of time with people who have gone from being extremely successful business owners with long histories in the business community, with good records as employers and as contributors to the community, to having the rug essentially pulled out from under them—through, seemingly, no fault of their own—and having to refinance their loans or having their loans called in, and it has absolutely crippled them. In some instances, it has bankrupted them. Not only has the bank taken their business; it has taken their house. It has taken their super. In some instances, the banks have taken everything and left them destitute. We saw another example of that on <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> on Sunday night, with the case of the Maloneys. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think as parliamentary leaders of the country we must look at every way we can make sure that small-business owners are not placed in that position, because there should be protections there, or, if they are, that there are protections provided to get a fair hearing, to be treated fairly at all times and to make sure that, if it gets to the point where there is a dispute, that dispute is heard quickly and, where able, there is compensation for harm that is caused. The Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has looked into this and made some comments on it. This is something that we need to pursue further. Of course, our position would be around a banking royal commission, but what I am saying in terms of running alongside this bill is that there are other ways that we need to look at making sure that small business is being given a fair go. We cannot take our eye off the ball. This does one thing, but there are many other ways that we need to support small businesses and make sure that they are treated fairly, treated with respect, and that their contribution to the community is acknowledged and they are not treated badly, particularly by the banks.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I am pleased that the Labor Party—at least their rhetoric—is about giving small business a fair go. I applaud that stated aim. I am pleased that Senator Gallagher, who has introduced this bill, has talked to small business in Canberra—one of the most privileged cities in Australia, I might add, and good luck to them—but I wonder how many small businesses Senator Gallagher has spoken to in Rockhampton, Mackay, Ayr—where I live—Townsville, Charters Towers, Clermont, the Bowen Basin towns, Dysart and Moranbah. I wonder how many small businesses she has spoken to there, because, if she had spoken to small business there, she would understand they are really struggling because of the downturn in the mining industry and the relentless campaign by the Greens to stop coalmining—a campaign which seems to be supported in this chamber by Labor senators and, I am disappointed to say, Labor senators from Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small business in the towns that I mentioned in my home state of Queensland are desperate to see the Adani mine go ahead, and the only thing holding it up at the moment is the uncertainty on the native title issue, which has been addressed by the government and by Indigenous leaders across Australia. Agreement has been reached to fix that issue, but it is essential that it be done urgently and immediately, which is what Indigenous leaders want and what the Queensland state Labor government wants. If the native title issue were made certain, Adani could go ahead with more confidence and small businesses in those northern towns would be delighted because it would be a lifeline thrown to many of them who are now looking at their life savings and their small business going down the drain. So, Senator Gallagher, I urge you, if you are serious about small business, to slip up to Central and North Queensland, talk to small businesses there and see how important Adani is to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has asked the Labor Party to sit tomorrow, on a Friday. I appreciate that is a holiday for most Labor senators. We just want them to give up one day of their holiday and sit tomorrow in this chamber so that we can fully debate the native title amendment and hopefully have it passed, because the Labor Party say they support it. Certainly, the Liberal and National parties support it. I understand One Nation supports it and I understand that the Liberal Democrats support it. So it should fly through the chamber if we have a whole day's debate on it tomorrow. Will the Labor Party sit and pass that legislation, which will help Adani, which will help small business, which Senator Gallagher has spent 20 minutes telling us she supports? Will they sit tomorrow? No—tomorrow is their day off. They have a long weekend. They do not want to work tomorrow. One can only ask why. Clearly, within the Labor Party there are deep divisions over the Adani issue and the Labor Party are doing everything in their power to delay this so that Adani will walk away and the mine will not go ahead. Could I ask Senator Gallagher again: what will that do for small business in Rockhampton, Gladstone, Clermont, Moranbah, Dysart, Ayr, Bowen, Home Hill, Townsville and Charters Towers? They are looking to Adani to save their businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not only the Labor government in Queensland that is very keen to see this happen; Labor mayors of Townsville, Rockhampton and Gladstone are also urging that this native title issue be made certain so that Adani can go ahead and small business will be able to look to a bright future. I hope Mayor Strelow, the Townsville mayor and Mr Burnett in Gladstone—Labor mayors—will be on the phone to Labor Queensland senators saying, 'Please give up a day of your long weekend and sit tomorrow so that we can pass this legislation, so that we can give certainty to the native title owners in that area, who desperately want to see this go ahead.' Why? Because it means jobs for their people. They understand this. That is why they have, by an overwhelming majority, already supported this. It is very important for Indigenous businessmen, and there are a number of very good Indigenous small-business people in North Queensland. They are looking to the Adani project to give their small businesses a boost. But what does the Labor Party do? It takes a day off tomorrow when we could be dealing with the native title legislation and having it passed through this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I plead with Premier Palaszczuk: 'If you are serious'—and I think you are because I know your government desperately needs the revenue from Adani—'please give your Queensland Labor senators'—and there are only four of them so it will not cost you a lot of money in phone calls—'a call and tell them Queensland is desperate for this.' Remember, the Senate is the states house. Labor senators from Queensland should be standing up for their state. This is not a Liberal-National Party person saying this; this is the Labor Premier of the state of Queensland desperately wanting this passed, and yet the Labor Party senators in this chamber want to ensure they have a long weekend by having tomorrow off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that the Labor Party are talking about helping small business, but the example I have just given clearly is like so much the Labor Party do: it is not what they say—talk is cheap; it is what they do. All those small businesses in my home state of Queensland are desperately awaiting this, and what do the Labor Party do? They turn their back on them. I appreciate that Labor has no senators outside the south-east corner of Queensland and their small business minister comes from Canberra, but I urge Queensland Labor senators to get out of the south-east corner and I urge the shadow minister to get out of Canberra and talk to small businesses in those areas and see what they say about Adani and the native title thing. If you were serious in your job, you would do something to make sure that that goes through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government on Tuesday night announced a budget that will set the growth in the years ahead in a positive way for Australians. In this budget the government has continued the very substantial concessions to small business in last year's budget. If the Labor Party want to help small business, they will do two things: (1) allow the Adani bill to pass through the parliament tomorrow, by sitting an extra day, and (2) support the budget legislation when it comes forward. As we all know, the Labor Party have not been very good at passing budget measures in the past, but we do ask them to support the extended instant asset write-off that was announced in the budget on Tuesday night. The budget extends the $20,000 instant asset write-off for a further 12 months to 30 June 2018. The turnover threshold will also be lifted to $10 million. This measure will substantially improve the cash flow for small business, helping them reinvest in their businesses, replace or upgrade their assets and employ more people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government has also committed budgeted money—budgeted money, as opposed to what you will hear from Mr Shorten tonight, who will throw around promises of money without paying for those promises; he will no doubt put it on the big credit card that Labor is very good at operating—to reduce red tape by providing up to $300 million to states and territories to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers. This builds upon the $5.8 billion of red tape reductions delivered by the coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am on this subject, I divert slightly to the low-value GST bill which is currently before the parliament and on which the committee has reported with some comments by the chair. It is a committee on which the government has a majority, but that does not stop us Liberal and National Party senators from criticising or making suggestions to government legislation where we think it appropriate. Senators may have read where the government majority committee unanimously has recommended that the starting date of that bill be delayed by one year to allow agencies and businesses to get ready for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also raised an issue in the context of small business and having the shippers actually collect the new tax on goods under $1,000 rather than the vendors, for many reasons which I will not go into here. But I think the government has a different view—although the committee is seeking clarification of this—in that, because the shippers already collect the money for goods over $1,000, why can't they do it under for goods under $1,000? That is a question that the committee has raised, and I look forward to the government explaining that. It seems to me that it would be better to continue in the same vein. I only mention this because I think any senators who go and talk to small businesses outside Canberra will understand that small businesses have been doing it tough in the face of competition from overseas suppliers of goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can understand why buying your goods online overseas is attractive to many Australians, because they do not have to pay the 10 per cent GST. They can get the same goods from the shop downtown, but they would have to pay the 10 per cent GST. Whether you like the GST or not, it is there and it is part of Australian life these days. But, if you buy overseas, your overseas competitor does not have to bother about that 10 per cent. So, for a start, the overseas competitor can sell the goods at 10 per cent less. The low-value GST bill is a way in which the coalition is trying to help small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I walk around many towns in Central and North Queensland and it is really distressing to see the number of closed shops and to think that many people have put their life savings into these small businesses and they have gone bust. There is a lifeline in Queensland, and that is called Adani. That must go ahead for many reasons but certainly small business in those areas would be delighted to see that happen. I just cannot understand why the Labor Party will not sit tomorrow so that we can debate the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill, which is the last real hurdle holding up Adani going ahead. If we could deal with that tomorrow—the Labor Party say they agree, One Nation agrees and the Liberal Democrats agree—we could get that bill through, Adani could have confidence to go ahead, and small business in central and north Queensland would be delighted. But we cannot get the Labor Party to sit tomorrow—I don't know, they might be used to three-day weekends! But please, why don't we sit tomorrow? You have paid for it, and we could deal with that bill, debate it fully, and hopefully get it passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If anyone happens to be listening to this debate and they happen to be from Queensland—and they will understand just how important this is to Queensland, particularly to Queensland's small businesses—then I would ask them to get on the phone and ring the four Queensland Labor senators. There are only four of them; it will not cost you much in telephone costs. But get on the phone to them. It might be a trunk-line call because they are all in Brisbane, and if you do not happen to live in Brisbane there might be a little bit of extra cost, but there are only four of them. Get on the phone to them and say: 'This is important for small business in Queensland, this is important for Indigenous small business in Queensland and this is important for Indigenous workers in Queensland.' It is important for all workers. It will mean 10,000 new jobs in an area which is currently struggling with substantial unemployment following the mining downturn a couple of years ago.</span>

                    </a>  I am sorry Senator Gallagher; perhaps they do not understand that what you are doing is encouraging more litigation. As a former lawyer, I tell you that if you start on litigation, the only people that will win are the lawyers. Yet this is what the Labor Party is doing; perhaps these days they have a lot of lawyers who are members of their party. That might be why they think it is a good idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has embarked on another course which we think will help small business. One of the provisions of this bill obliges the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide legal advice on the prospect of obtaining an order of no costs. That is not good public policy—we should not have government agencies giving legal advice of that nature. If a party took up litigation on the basis of such advice from the ombudsman, and if the courts did not grant this order in their favour, can the party withdraw from the litigation without cost penalty? It is also not clear what liability the ombudsman's office would have for providing legal advice which turned out not to be accepted by the court. So there are a lot of flaws in this bill; unfortunately, time does not allow me to go through all of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is trying to help small business by giving confidence to the Adani mine, which will really help small business. We are also bringing in tax cuts whereby 3.2 million small businesses will pay less tax as of this current financial year, and more small businesses will be able to access small business tax concessions as a result of the change to the definition of small business, raising the threshold from $2 million to $10 million. Those tax cuts were legislated for in May this year, and that will really help small business. We are reforming the competition policy, as suggested in the Harper review in section 46 on the misuse of market power; we are levelling the playing field for small business, to encourage competition and greater productivity; and we have extended the unfair contract term protections to small business entering standard form contracts—that provision commenced in November last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no good for Labor to bring forward these bills which they know will not be passed. It is no good for Mr Shorten to get up tonight and promise money he does not have. If they want to help small business, Labor need to support the government's proposals for small business in the back tax—and please, can I ask the Labor Party: if you are serious about small business, sit tomorrow! Curtail your long weekend, and do what you are paid to do: come into this chamber tomorrow and debate this, so that we can get this bill through. It not only benefits Adani, workers and Indigenous people, it also benefits the steel mill in Whyalla—I cannot understand why any South Australian senator would oppose that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor bill, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill, is about access to justice. My colleagues and I wholeheartedly support this bill. The intent of this bill is to do something about the chronic lack of access to justice in this country when it comes to dealing with disputes, particularly commercial disputes. As I have done before, I disclose that I am the proprietor of a very, very small law firm with 2.6 lawyers working in it, where we do principally personal injuries work and a bit of commercial work. From my time as a practising lawyer—and I still have a practising certificate, so that I can do my pro bono work in gambling cases and the like—I know that the justice system in this country is broken when it comes to access to justice. There are so many people in this country who have a genuine dispute and who are told by their lawyers: 'You have a 70 or 80 per cent chance of winning.' But they still will not go ahead with that case because of the risk of adverse cost orders which could cause them to lose their home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it goes beyond that. There is an independent supermarket proprietor—I will not name that person—who is very successful; he has a significant turnover and employs many, many people in more than one state. He tells me that if Coles and Woolies do something, whether it is predatory pricing or some other conduct, which his lawyers say could lead to a successful action for abuse of market power—under our current laws—his lawyers tell him: 'You have a really good chance of winning. But, by the way, it is going to cost you $3 or $4 million to run it, and you could be up for adverse cost orders of millions of dollars more.' That is not a justice system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what the Productivity Commission said back in September 2014 when they looked at access to justice arrangements. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are widespread concerns that Australia's civil justice system is too slow, too expensive and too adversarial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That goes to the nub of the problem that this bill seeks to address. We know what has happened in other countries, including in the UK. My understanding is that this bill picks up on elements of best practice, so that we can have a system where there are filters and safeguards in place before an action is brought, to deal with frivolous and vexatious actions; a system where you need to show that you have a prima facie case where you have a matter that has got real merit in it but that is subject to dispute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting rid of adverse cost orders will not mean that it is going to be a pushover to deal with these cases, but it will mean that at least parties will know what they are up for in terms of their own costs. It will mean that they will not be subject to being 'deep-pocketed' by a much larger corporation that can drive the litigant, the plaintiff, into the ground. This bill attempts to address that. The bill, in terms of the specific provisions, may need some fine-tuning, may need some extra work done to it, but the principle of the bill that has been introduced here by Senator Gallagher is a very good one. That is why we support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also say, on behalf of my colleagues, that we also support, with some amendments, the 'effects test' that the government is putting up, in the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2016. It is something that the Nationals have been outspoken on and something that I have worked on for many years with people like former Senator Joyce, now the Deputy Prime Minister. We think that will make a real difference for those small and medium businesses in disputes involving large corporations which abuse their market power. But we think that that bill will be so much more effective, will do what it is meant to do, if it incorporates the elements of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To Senator Gallagher, I say, 'Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.' We are going to flatter you by moving a whole range of amendments based on this bill to the government's effects test bill, because we think that is the right thing to do in order to make that piece of legislation work much more effectively. It is no good having a rolled-gold piece of legislation on an effects test. The effects test needs to be modified. It has been constrained in its current form in terms of the government's bill. If we have these amendments in substance, it will mean that the bill will have genuine teeth, because people will be able to have their day in court without the fear of being bankrupted by taking a meritorious claim to court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, as a team, we support this legislation. It is a worthy piece of legislation. It is long overdue. I congratulate Senator Gallagher for moving this legislation. This is the way forward. If you want to have effective competition and consumer laws in this country, you must have an effective system of access to justice, and this bill goes some considerable way to achieving it. That is why we so wholeheartedly support it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I want to speak to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, but I feel it is important to address some of the comments that have been made by some of the previous senators in this debate. I will start by echoing some words from Senator Xenophon that he said towards Senator Macdonald—that he is very fond of the senator. Senator Xenophon, I am one of the many senators who are very fond of you, but even I at times have to question your judgement when it comes to friends! Senator Macdonald appeared to spend a large proportion of his time speaking on the bill. I will be speaking a little bit more broadly about other issues. I will take the precedent that we are able to have a wide-ranging debate on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note the incredible work of Senator Gallagher from the Australian Capital Territory. I do not quite understand why this became a point of attack. Yes, Senator Gallagher is from the ACT. While at times—especially when we have to sit over long winters—we all question the ACT for many different reasons, I do not understand the idea that, because she is a senator from the territory that she represents, speaks to people from the territory that she represents and was the Chief Minister of the territory that she represents, it somehow means that she cannot possibly have had conversations with people outside of the ACT and cannot possibly have had conversations with people in Queensland or other places. I note that Senator Gallagher has actually spent more time in Queensland than the Treasurer of Australia. The Treasurer has not even visited Queensland this year, let alone the Northern Territory, which he has not visited, it appears, since becoming Treasurer. I cannot speak to Western Australia and other states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend Senator Gallagher and her predecessor from the other place, the honourable member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland, for the work they have done on this bill. Senator Xenophon touched on this quite well: fundamentally, we in this country have a legal system that is not fair in practice, even when at times it may be fair in theory. There is a huge disconnect between what is the law and what is access to the law. What this bill attempts is to do what it can to close that gap in the legal system—it is not going to be perfect, because there is no perfect solution. We pass bills constantly in this place, and they all seem fantastic and great and they are equitable and fair and we have these great principles of 'everybody is equal before the law', as we should have those principles. At the same time we have a legal system where access to justice makes a big difference. In this particular case, access to justice relates to the power of large corporations, as opposed to the power of small businesses, when it comes to being able to access those legal remedies. That is the real problem, the real challenge, that we have to face and that this legislation attempts to face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is the reality. I come from a family of small-business people. My parents had a small cake store in Castle Hill in the north-west of Sydney when I was growing up. They now own a small business in the Queen Victoria Building—a King of Knives kind of retail outlet. When you deal with small—</span>

                    </a>  I will take that interjection. Senator Fierravanti-Wells wants to know whether the fact that my parents own a knife store is what has made me so effective in the New South Wales Labor Party. I remind the senator that the art of using a knife is knowing when not to use one, not knowing when to use one.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two separate debates that we are going to have. There is going to be the debate around the effects test. I think the Labor Party position on that has been quite clear. We do not believe the evidence is there and we do not believe that it is the right approach, but there are others who support the view. I have heard a lot of arguments about the effects test. I think it is an important debate to have. It is not mutually exclusive from this bill and it is not mutually exclusive from the debate we are having. They are two separate pieces of legislation. I believe access to justice in fact is a far more important principle than what we are looking at. Frankly, the idea that larger businesses are able to use the threat of the costs that may be incurred from legal action to prevent people from using their rights under the law is a highly concerning one. Let us not kid ourselves: it is a tactic that has been used, not just in business cases. Those of us involved in politics have seen these kinds of intimidatory tactics used, especially around defamation and other areas. But a tactic of big businesses with big pockets is to tie up and make the legal process so difficult and expensive for a smaller business as to prevent them from being able to get the legal remedy that they may seek, to prevent them from being able to get the outcome they may want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you as a smaller business are dealing with larger institutions that have their own army of lawyers, that have the sunk cost of in-house counsel—let us deal with a hypothetical: the type of situation where there may be a dispute over a brand or a site or a location of a business. The idea that some small business with a handful of staff is really going to be able to compete at a legal level with the enormity of the legal representation that is presented by some of these companies creates an unfair playing field. While the legislation itself, and how it is written, may not be the problem—the legislation itself presents everyone as being equal before the law—we all know and have seen used time and time again the tactic of having lawyers and access to justice as the vehicle for preventing equity and preventing justice from being carried out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill looks at restoring that balance. It will never be perfect. We are never going to have a system that will perfectly give equal opportunity before the law, but this bill looks at how much of that gap can be closed. It is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business a level of access to justice that they do not have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses have the legal right to take action if a competitor is engaging in anticompetitive conduct. However, it is so hard for businesses to do that even when there is a breach of competition laws, as the justice level between them is so stretched. I think the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC—who we will have before our estimates in the next few weeks and we will have an opportunity to go further into the conversation we have with them—have highlighted their concern at the idea that the access to justice is not really there. This bill will address the difficulties small business face in getting that justice, because it does two really important things.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it allows the Federal Court to waive liability for costs to smaller business private litigants bringing these cases. Senator Xenophon presented a figure from his life experiences as being those who have a strong case and a good case, but you are never sure before the law, nor should you be—there is always a risk involved when there is a lawyer. A good lawyer may advise that they have an 80 to 90 per cent chance, but that 10 per cent chance of having costs awarded against them may be so significant that they are unable to pursue that action. Secondly, businesses will be able to go to the ombudsman to get early assistance to find out whether they should consider going for these new non-adverse cost orders. In fact, there will be an independent procedure for them to be able to get the information that they need to determine whether they should or should not pursue this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important equity measure, an important step to be taken for equity. Senator Macdonald spent the whole of his 20-minute speech talking at length about the small business contribution and the small business relationship between the Adani coalmine in northern Queensland—sorry, I will be fair, the proposed Adani mine in northern Queensland—and its impact on small business. The point he was making was about the flow-on effects that a project like that will present to small businesses. I believe that if we are talking about small businesses and we are talking about equity and fairness, then the big issue of fairness that we need to address—and this bill goes in part to start doing that—is the inequity between larger corporations and how they pay their tax and how small businesses, which do not have those legal structures, do not have those opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Macdonald went on at length about Adani and about their supposed record of being great corporate citizens. I feel that it would be only fair to make a contrast with a company like Chevron, that we have had the opportunity to hear from recently. At the end of April the new managing director of Chevron Australia, Nigel Hearne, fronted a Senate inquiry about corporate tax avoidance held in Perth in Western Australia. This whole notion of inequity between small business and big business was really brought to light for me by seeing a situation where you have a company the size, nature and structure of Chevron that has paid no corporate tax last year, will pay no corporate tax this year, paid no PRRT—petroleum resource rent tax—last year, paid no PRRT this year and will likely not be paying it for many, many years into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about justice and equity for small business we have to ask ourselves: where is the justice and equity when the small businesses of Australia are paying their taxes, paying their fair share, and the larger corporations are able to structure themselves in ways that allow them not to do so? My issue with the structures of companies like Chevron is not that what they are doing is illegal, as I do not believe what they are doing is illegal. My concern is that in many, many cases what they have done has been legal; what they have done has been allowed under our laws. Sure, there have been some shark tactics—there are matters before the Federal Court at the moment. There are issues that are being challenged by the tax office, and I give the tax office credit for doing that. But these are the real issues—these are the equity issues that have to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, the oil price is $50 a barrel. At today's price, Chevron and other multinational corporations will not pay PRRT, petroleum resource rent tax, for the whole life of the projects. We are giving away this entire resource without getting back the tax that is meant to be there for us to be able to recoup something. How is that fair for small businesses, when they do not have those opportunities? How is that equitable?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the CEO of Chevron himself, Mr Nigel Hearne. He was previously the CEO of Chevron Appalachia, and under his watch there was an explosion at a Chevron-owned oil well in Pennsylvania that killed a 27-year-old contractor who was working on the site. It also forced nearby residents to be evacuated. Five days after the explosion, when the fire was still smouldering, Chevron sent letters to local residents who might have been impacted and offered them a voucher for a large pizza and a two-litre soft drink. After this incident, the state of Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection issued Chevron with one of the largest fines it has ever levied. The parents of the killed worker reached a $5 million settlement with the company after the state confirmed the site was not properly supervised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before that role, from 2011 to 2013 Mr Hearne was the general manager of Chevron's refinery in Richmond, California. This is one of Chevron's largest refineries, and, under Mr Hearne's watch, a fire at the refinery nearly killed 19 workers and caused 15,000 people to seek hospital treatment. According to a report by the US Chemical Safety Board, a federal government agency, a pipe rupture released flammable high-temperature light gas oil, which then partially vaporised into a large opaque vapour cloud that engulfed 19 Chevron employees. The cloud ignited, and the explosion caused a large plume of vapour, particulates and black smoke, which travelled across the surrounding area. There was an emergency warning for three nearby cities in the following weeks, and approximately 15,000 people sought medical treatment at nearby medical facilities, for ailments including breathing problems, chest pains, shortness of breath, sore throat and headaches. California's Attorney-General and the local District Attorney brought criminal charges against Chevron for the incident. Chevron pleaded no contest to six charges, agreeing to increase oversight by state agencies and pay $2 million in fines and remediation costs. Separately, the state's occupational safety and health regulator fined Chevron $782,000 and issued six 'serious' and nine 'wilful' violations for the incident. Less than three weeks after the incident, health and safety inspectors were back at the refinery and issued five 'serious' and two new 'wilful' violations, with fines of over $173,000. This is the track record of the CEO of Chevron in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are debating here how it is that there is one set of rules for larger corporations, one set of standards for the big multinationals, and yet, when it comes to small business wanting access to justice, access to decency, access to fairness, that is not present. There is a huge gulf between the ways in which different groups of people, different groups of businesses, are treated in our society. Especially when it comes to justice—and I believe justice relates to tax justice as well as legal justice—we should be asking ourselves: why is it not fair; why do these gulfs exist; why is there this gap?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we have before us is not going to fix all these problems. The bill that we have before us is not going to fix the huge inequity between small and big business in Australia. No one piece of legislation will. But it goes a step in the right direction towards providing justice. It goes a step in the right direction towards creating a fair, more equitable, more even playing field insofar as it relates to being able to get court access and court justice. This is a bill that represents a commitment that the Labor Party took to the last election. It was developed by wide consultation with a lot of businesses, many of whom said that, at a practical level, the theoretical structure of the law, as important as that is—and everyone believes that is important—it is the practical reality of how it is implemented on the ground that really affects the day-to-day lives of different businesses and that really affects the day-to-day lives of business operators. Where we need to be looking at is not just having the perfect laws in theory passed through our parliaments but making sure that everyone has equal access to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equity in business does not just stop here. There is a huge equity issue. I note that Senator Scullion from the Northern Territory is here and he can talk at length about the challenges of inequity when it comes to, particularly, Indigenous Australians and others. I think we in this parliament do a very good job in many instances in framing laws that we believe are fair and equitable, and that are fair and equitable. But the challenge always is at a delivery level when we leave a chamber like this or a place like parliament. Let us not kid ourselves; we are all very privileged to be here and we are privileged people. Having that same kind of access on the ground on a day-to-day basis and having that same kind of representation before the law—that is always a really big challenge that we struggle with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion—and I note I have used up my time—this is a bill that is about making sure competition laws are better by giving a little bit of a leg up to small businesses in the unfair fights that they have to face. Businesses who have a right to access and go laws often do not do so because of the fear of the costs that are associated with it. Even when small businesses have a strong case, they have to be very careful about the fact that larger players have a lot of money and a far greater capacity to fight these cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a worry that if they lose their case they could face large bills and be driven out of business. They do not have the same kind of risk profile that larger businesses, especially those that have huge in-house legal teams that are already sunk costs, are able to deal with. I note that the ACCC has been very strong on this issue. I note that other consumer groups have been very strong on this issue. I note that the small business lobby has been very strong on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill. I believe it is a bill that should be supported by the Australian Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Before addressing myself to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, I propose to spend some moments on the importance of the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. Also, I foreshadow that I will be responding to what I believe to have been a highly inaccurate and cowardly statement by Senator Dastyari about Chevron and its now managing director, Mr Hearne. I think it is a disgrace that a person under parliamentary privilege would come in and make the statements that he has made. But I will get onto that in a few moments, because he is wrong. This chamber and those listening need to know just how wrong and how dastardly Senator Dastyari has been in that attack on Chevron.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go, if I may, because it is directly relevant to the opportunities in small business access, to that associated with the native title amendment bill that is before us. I have to urge everybody in this chamber that, before we rise and return to our home states and territories, we have to address this anomaly. It comes about as a result of the fact of a decision of a justice in McGlade in the Federal Court in Perth recently in which he overturned what had been the decision of a justice in Bygrave previously in relation to native title claims, particularly the percentage of native title claimants associated with them. In Bygrave, the justice had the view that so long as there was greater than 51 per cent of native title claimants then it was possible to proceed with what is known as an Indigenous Land Use Agreement. Where the McGlade case has caused the change and has caused the ruction, is McGlade has effectively required 100 per cent of claimants to be in agreement before anything can proceed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, it has something to do with Adani mine. But, by Jove, that is one of the very few. I learned from my very good colleague Senator Scullion that there are some 126 agreements around Australia associated with native title that are affected by this decision. They are going to affect the benefits to native title claimants associated with those Indigenous Land Use Agreements. These land use agreements are themselves, of course, voluntary. They are providing an opportunity for native title groups to use those rights in beneficial ways, particularly in relation to economic development to provide certainty for all parties doing business on native title land. And if Senator Dastyari and his colleagues, and indeed everyone in this chamber, is genuinely interested in ensuring the continued benefit to native title recipients under those ILUAs then it will be in their greatest interests to make sure we do not rise from this place until we deal with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a bill before the chamber. It will address the concerns that McGlade has raised, and it is incumbent on all of us. If we fail to, each one of us must go back to those native title groups, including those in the Indigenous areas as well as the companies with whom they deal, and explain to them why there is now no certainty. I know on a personal basis a colleague who, only this week and next week, is associated with some negotiations on native title. This particular person is in the eastern states this week representing the interests of Aboriginal people, and next week in the North of Australia he will be representing the interests of a mining company. He is an absolutely eminent man of great integrity, but I know that this negotiation is now on hold whilst we deal with this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that a grant that is made under an invalid Indigenous Land Use Agreement will itself be invalid against native title—that is in my state with the Noongar people for whom this particular judgment was made in the Federal Court by Justice McGlade. It will have application right around Australia and, I dare say, the islands adjacent to us. This is of critical importance and, if people really want to do something in the small business space to continue to encourage Aboriginal people under these ILUAs, to continue to encourage other companies to deal with, to participate in and to work for the improvement of people in those communities, it is essential that we deal with this native title amendment Indigenous land act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the fact that Senator Dastyari has remained in the chamber—I thank you for that. Senator Dastyari made the comment a few moments ago—and, if <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> proves I am wrong, I am willing to be corrected—through you, Acting Deputy President, that Chevron had paid no corporate tax in the last couple of years. I can tell you that—perhaps wrongly—I used a mobile phone in the chamber to check only in the last few minutes with the senior executive of Chevron of Australia, who assured me that in the last four to five years that company has paid no less than $4 billion of tax. If you listen to Senator Dastyari, you would be invited to draw the conclusion that company had paid no tax. Those were the words that were used: no corporate tax paid. They were your words—through you, Acting Deputy President. Senator Dastyari should know about the petroleum resource rent tax. It is a super profits tax after you have met and have reimbursed certain costs. He is making the comment that, in the projects with which Chevron is associated, they have paid no PRRT. For heavens' sake, the project at Gorgon on Barrow Island has only got two of three new LNG trains up and running. The project at Wheatstone has not yet commissioned its first one. How in heavens' name would a person who pretends to have the economic knowledge that Senator Dastyari pretends to understand and believe and stand up in this place and draw the inference that this company has paid no PRRT when indeed they have not yet got to the stage of making a profit? What Senator Dastyari failed to say was that this company, Chevron, which he is so keen to run down, has invested no less than—</span>

                    </a>  I assure you, Senator Dastyari, no offence was taken. I do want to place on the record the fact that this company, in two major projects—at Gorgon and Wheatstone—are investing US$130 billion. To put it into perspective, in today's dollars, that is a project 15 times the size of the Snowy Mountains Scheme—US$130 billion. They will employ 19,000 people in construction. Over the 40-year life of those two projects they will contribute trillions of dollars to the Australian economy, over 100,000 jobs, billions of dollars in taxes and royalties, and, yes, a petroleum resource rent tax. They have invested billions of dollars with local small businesses in Western Australia, around Dampier, Onslow and the other ports. They have effectively developed the town of Onslow. Whilst comments were made by Senator Dastyari—about a person who cannot defend himself and on projects outside of Australia—I can relate to this chamber, as I have done in the past, the very fine occupational health, safety and welfare record of that company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in passing, before I go back to addressing the subject of this discussion today, I should say to those who have any concerns about Chevron in the environmental space that Chevron's Gorgon project on Barrow Island is, in fact, in an A-class reserve. It is by far and away, as a result directly of Chevron's investment and care for the natural environment of Barrow Island, the best managed A-class reserve anywhere, not only on mainland Australia but around the Australian coastline. I reject, totally and thoroughly, the assertions made by Senator Dastyari.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn, if I may, to the bill that is before us. I say very proudly that the coalition government always has and always will back small business. We will back it like a Melbourne Cup winner: up the straight, all the way, past the finishing line and through to the parade area. I will tell you why—because it is the engine room of the Australian economy. It employs nearly five million Australians in rural regions, in remote areas of Australia and in suburbs. It employs people at the lower end of the skills level as well as through to highly skilled people. It is the most versatile of all of the employment groups in this country. I am very proud to say that, in the budget of only the last couple of days, we announced a further tax cut for small business and, of course, we will see the company tax rate reduced to some 25 per cent. For those who quite rightly say that an enormous number of small businesses are not companies, it is important to record that there is also a five per cent tax discount for unincorporated companies, for sole operators and partnerships. These are the real issues that help small businesses and encourage further employment of young people and older people in our economy. There is the tax deduction of being able to write off in the one year $20,000 for assets purchased, and multiples of them—not just one. As a restaurant and cafe owner said to me when we first introduced this, 'I can now bring forward by four months the start of my new business because I can purchase different equipment to make that operation run—each one up to $20,000—and I can write it off fully in the first year.' That restaurant is up and running with 14 or 15 staff already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to say what the coalition government is doing and will continue to do. Having run small and medium sized businesses and still assisting constituents where I am able to, in terms of their obligations under the BAS, PAYG, superannuation et cetera, I can say it is the small-business person who really does the work for the Tax Commissioner. They fill out the BAS at the end of every quarter, make sure that the superannuation commitments are met and paid and ensure, of course, that workers compensation insurance and public liability insurance are paid. It is no wonder it is so difficult to make a quid in small business. But this government has cut red tape by $4½ billion, simplifying those processes that I was just speaking about, and removing many small businesses—up to half a million of them—from the PAYG system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A scheme which I am very minded towards and I think needs enormous support from the parliament is the employee share scheme. If we can get employees to actually own shares in the business in which they are employed, then of course they have that greater incentive, because they themselves are part of the ownership. I, for one, will be watching that aspect of it very, very closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen in recent times the opening up of the China-Australia, the Korea-Australia and the Japan-Australia free trade agreements. The best example of all, of course, is the cherry producer in Tasmania who has taken his cherry exports from a very small proportion to being a very significant exporter of that horticultural product into the Chinese market with significant improvement in employment, as I understand it—perhaps Senator McKim would be more familiar than I am and might know—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the initiatives being taken by this coalition government in the services sector and the commodities sector to encourage small business even more. An ombudsman being appointed—and reference is made to the ombudsman in the bill being proposed by the Labor Party, and I will speak some more about the ombudsman's position. It is proposed in the bill to enable the ombudsman to provide assistance, as I understand it, with advising a private litigant on the arguments that might be made and the evidence needed to satisfy a court to grant a no adverse costs order. That of itself sounds all right. The only problem is: to what extent might it compromise an ombudsman who afterwards may have been seen to have given advice to an applicant or to a private litigant only to find out that that advice is now the subject of a challenge? We cannot really have a circumstance in which the ombudsman could themselves be the subject of a court action as a result of incorrect or inadequate advice given to a litigant. So there are, I think, difficulties associated with that particular element.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the Labor Party for putting this bill before the chamber. It recognises that they do have an understanding of some of the challenges associated with the issues of small business in Australia—expanding small business.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of us who have been in business all our lives, we actually do not like the term 'small business' all that much. It suggests that you want to remain small. Of course you do not want to remain small; the whole objective of business is to grow that business and move, perhaps, towards medium business and, in so doing, to employ more people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to the employee share scheme: imagine the scenario as long-trusted employees are part of an opportunity to expand a business and then indeed the next step—not always the best step for a business in my own experience—to move into export markets and be able to develop both your services and/or commodities along those lines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mention is made in this legislation—and I come to the decision of the coalition government in accepting the recommendations of the Harper review on the repeal of section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act and replacing it with a provision that prevents firms with substantial market power from engaging in conduct that has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. I join with Senator Dastyari in the concept of the capacity of a larger company to be able to use its market power, market strength, to be able to dominate a small business. I have no difficulty with that argument; he just chose the wrong example in my humble opinion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you an example of some of the big retailers who will proudly announce to the retail market that they are going to undertake a huge discount of some product, only then to go back to the farmer, the supplier or the horticulturalist and say, 'Oh, by the way, we're undertaking a big discount on milk'—or a big discount on chicken or a big discount on some other product, be it almonds or whatever—'and, by the way, we're going to pay for most of it by reducing the payment to you in that scenario.' That is abuse of market power. It places the small business in a situation where they cannot negotiate their way out of that, as they are locked into supply and of course they have no alternative. So there are definitely circumstances where we have to ensure that big business does not have that unfair competitive advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislation that we have introduced in this space, the Fair Work Amendment (Small Business—Penalty Rates Exemption) Bill—which we introduced into this parliament in 2015—is directed at protecting the interests of small business and indeed protecting the interests of employees in small business. We have also of course seen the involvement of the ACCC. In November of last year they released their report going to the whole concept of unfair trading relationships between large and small business, particularly where small businesses are, in a sense, forced to sign contracts or are at least influenced to sign contracts. Under the provisions of the ACCC, which the government accepted, we now know that a small business can challenge a term in a standard form contract, which is also a small business contract, on the basis that it is unfair. Big business were not happy with us, and they lobbied very, very hard against us. But the decision was taken to ensure the protection of small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, most small business people are their own accountant, their own person associated with marketing and they are their own person associated with sales. As I said earlier, at the end of every quarter they are the person sitting down trying to work out the BAS, trying to work out revenue and expenditure and trying to make sure they get superannuation liabilities paid et cetera. They are not the sorts of organisations that have huge teams of lawyers, accountants and others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will continue to support small business by way of entrepreneurship, by way of innovation and by way of start-up and particularly by protecting small business when it comes to competition with big business and indeed with big unions. Whilst the Labor Party's bill is there to be debated, it does miss most of the elements important to small business.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise to speak to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017. In commencing my comments I want to commend the work of Senator Gallagher in putting together this bill, which I think is very much targeted at the heart of the problem regarding competition between large and small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go to my more substantive comments on the bill, I feel compelled to make some comments in respect of the contribution made by Senator Macdonald earlier in the debate. Senator Macdonald, in the course of his contribution, found ways of talking about Adani and the native title bill and then went on to discuss the low-value GST report which the Senate Economics Committee has handed down and had a good discussion about some of those points. In their own right, there were some interesting and perhaps constructive comments made throughout parts of Senator Macdonald's contribution, but they certainly lacked any connection with the very worthwhile bill that is before the chamber for consideration today, which is unfortunate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome Senator Xenophon's support for this bill. I note that he said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and that there would be comparable amendments coming forward from his party in relation to government legislation to address this area. I think that illustrates the fact that this bill does go to the heart of many of the problems that are affecting small business—they are fighting in the marketplace, trying to do the right thing and conduct their business, but they are rubbing up against the interests of big business, who have a substantial advantage over them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this is an issue. Senator Dastyari, in his contribution, talked about that issue—where businesses have deep pockets, they are able to, essentially, deny others the right to access justice. This is a huge concern. It has been identified by the Productivity Commission, which made some recommendations in respect of protective cost orders in 2014. We know that this is a very important issue. Unfortunately, we do not see a great deal of wholehearted support for this proposition on the other side. Instead, we see the government going down the track of the proposal to amend the effects test, which we have some concerns with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the right pathway to improve competition in our economy. On our side of the chamber we understand small businesses and the struggles they face against the much bigger, well-funded and well-advised corporations. We know that small businesses face many barriers when it comes to taking action against anticompetitive behaviour by the big end of town. Rather than implementing the Deputy Prime Minister's latest thought bubble, which was the effects test, this bill delivers real change for small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An effects test is shorthand for a test that looks at whether conduct engaged in by a firm with a substantial degree of market power has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. This is dangerous economic policy. It is not just Labor that is saying this. I note that, in relation to the inquiry into the government legislation, the Waste Buying Group—a waste and recycling services business in the commercial industrial marketplace—made a submission which was quite informative. This business indicated that it was operating in an industry dominated by huge multinational firms who practise a range of tactics designed to hold a client bound to service contracts. They say the consequence is that it leads to poor competition in the marketplace and results in high prices and poor service outcomes for the client base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One would think that this is one of those types of businesses that would wholeheartedly embrace the effects test and any purported effort to even up the position of large and small businesses. However, that is not the case. This business indicates that small business and clients will simply not be able to afford the costs of expensive trials in relation to this matter. Based on their experience, they believe that the ACCC will be overwhelmed with work, under resourced or just not interested. They believe that the ACCC—this is their own view, not my own view—is not an authority they can rely upon to advocate for the industry. In their submission, they recommended the introduction of an affordable tribunal to adjudicate abuse or market-power competition issues, so that small businesses or their clients could access it. That is a good illustration of the fact that this is not a Labor thought bubble; this is something that does have support out there amongst small businesses who understand that the government's approach is flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effects test risks making business afraid to compete, which ultimately hurts consumers. This will create a legal risk every time a business seeks to lower prices for their customers, and what obviously will happen in that situation is that consumers will be the losers. This is at a time when we are all faced with cost-of-living pressures. We know that we have wage growth at record lows. We know we have increasing unemployment and below trend economic growth. In this environment, we need all of the resources of the market to bring prices down so that consumers can benefit from that, so that families can make ends meet. This is a hugely important consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are not the only group of people warning of a lawyers' picnic if the government's legislation on the effects test were to pass. The small business lobby group COSBOA themselves have stated that they are concerned that the wording will create a lawyers' picnic, as predicted by the opponents of the effects test. When even the original proponents of the policy are saying that it is dangerous, you know that the government has made a complete mess of competition policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor do welcome strong competition policy, but it must be informed and enforced, and the government package is neither. What we are seeing are dangerous legislative proposals without addressing either the resources of the ACCC, which was commented on by the Waste Buying Group submission, or making it easier for small businesses to litigate in their own private capacity. In the words of former Treasurer Peter Costello, 'a so-called effects test will protect competitors, especially less efficient ones, from competition'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1974—and I think this point has been made previously—there have been at least 10 inquiries into Australia's competition laws which have considered a proposed effects test and rejected it. Apart from Professor Harper's review, only one other inquiry has ever recommended it. So there is a reason why 10 out of 12 inquiries have recommended against an effects test. The reason for that is it is bad law. It is going to have a detrimental impact on the consumer. In the submissions to the Harper review, the effects test has been described as legally unworkable, something that will chill competition and something that will create uncertainty for business. These changes will deter job-creating investment in Australia by adding to the new layers of red tape and barriers to investment which have already been imposed by the coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is little wonder that the government's own former Minister for Trade and Investment, Mr Robb, is opposed to this latest anti-investment measure. The Turnbull government's proposed effects test is a move to satisfy internal politics. This is not about policy. A level-headed analysis of the effects test shows that the Prime Minister is using competition policy as a political prop. We know that the Prime Minister himself has said previously that he would be deeply concerned about the introduction of an effects test, and we have seen other people such as Mr Samuel, the former ACCC chairman, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Harper amendment, businesses would curb their competitive behaviour because of the legal risk. This would have drowned the commercial activity of big business in a sea of uncertainty. Lawyers and economists would need to sit at the right hand of business CEOs to guide them on the legality of every significant transaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite clear that it is Mr Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister, who has become the government's chief economic spokesperson, and this is detrimental to the Australian consumers and the broader economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understand that cost orders from courts represent an insurmountable barrier for many small businesses. We have the Competition and Consumer Act, but if it is too expensive for small businesses to take action then clearly that is a problem; our society is the worse for it, with some anticompetitive conduct not made public and not properly addressed. It should not be acceptable today for big businesses with deep pockets and armies of lawyers to overwhelm small businesses. The legal fees are a significant obstacle for small businesses across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To generate this public good of a fair, competitive economy, it is important that small businesses be given the ability to raise court actions without the threat of long, expensive and protracted court cases. It is important that a well-funded and well-advised large firm is not able to wear small businesses down. The Turnbull government has refused to address this inequity despite, as I said earlier, the Productivity Commission and the government's own competition review saying that small businesses are disadvantaged in the court process. Labor's Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 will restore the balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in the court case. Allowing small businesses to seek relief from adverse costs orders at an early stage of the judicial process will provide financial certainty to the private litigant. A judge would hear this application and decide on the merits. This would require amendments to the Federal Court Rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sensible change, a pro-small-business move that empowers them to make full use of the laws that we have on the books. It is also in line with international trends. Other countries are trying to find ways to encourage private litigation so the public interest can be served. In the United States there is a view that public interest in private litigation occurring is so great that positive measures should be taken to actively encourage it. Consequently, a private party which successfully proves an antitrust claim is entitled to treble damages—three times the proven loss caused by the conduct. No such policy currently exists under Australian law. In the European Union the commission has called on all jurisdictions in which costs follow the event, as in Australia, to carefully review the appropriateness of this approach in competition cases as, again, there is considered to be a significant benefit to the public when private matters are pursued through the courts. In the United Kingdom the Competition Appeals Tribunal has been established and has been granted discretion to make any order it sees fit in relation to costs, as opposed to the usual rule. So there is international interest in the approach that has been taken by Labor on this matter. It shows that we are at the forefront of seeking to address one of the key concerns that small businesses have today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the issue of mitigating risk, Labor's legislation will enable the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be successful. There are risks when opposing no adverse costs order. Where legal action has no or little cost, the risk of frivolous or vexatious litigation increases. In fact, if legal action is of sufficiently low cost, the threat of vexatious legal action could be used when negotiating with a larger firm. However, these risks can be mitigated and do not outweigh the potential benefit of increasing private litigation under the Competition and Consumer Act. It is proposed that the small business ombudsman be funded to vet applications, preventing adverse costs orders under part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act. This process is designed to provide advice to the potential litigant and will not mandate a no adverse costs order in any court case. This will help small businesses to better understand their prospects of obtaining a no adverse costs order and will act to reduce the risk of frivolous litigation where the ombudsman does not see merit in the litigation. This will not constitute legal advice under this bill, and the ombudsman cannot provide advice and support to private litigants. The ombudsman will be restricted to assessing whether there is the possibility of a no adverse costs order. Where the ombudsman positively vets an application from a potential private litigant, a letter of support will be provided to the applicant. This nonbinding letter of support would indicate to the applicant that there is a good case for a no-costs order to be approved by a judge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a pragmatic approach and it is the sort of approach that gives small business the confidence to use the legal system. Unfortunately, there is a widespread view amongst not only small businesses but also other members of the community that, when they are taking on a large adversary in the court system, they might as well not even try, because the odds are stacked against them. This very pragmatic approach breaks down those barriers to access to justice. It assists small businesses and private litigants, as opposed to the introduction of the effects test, and confers a useful and practical power on the new ombudsman. A three-person section in the small business ombudsman has been costed at $500,000 per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small business is crucial to Australia's economy. The budget that we have just seen confirms that Mr Turnbull is a Prime Minister for the big end of town over those working hard to grow their businesses and create jobs. Small businesses make up 97 per cent of businesses in Australia and are the engine room of the economy. We all use that terminology, but it is true. They employ more than 4.7 million people and contribute in excess of $343 billion to the economy every year. This scale simply cannot be ignored. That is why we would like to have seen Mr Turnbull and the Treasurer put more of a focus on small and medium businesses in the budget instead of focusing on the big end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business access to justice. Businesses have the legal right to take action if a competitor is engaging in anticompetitive conduct. However, at the moment it is very hard for small businesses to do this, even where there is a clear breach of our competition laws. Even where a small business has a strong case, they have to think very carefully about the fact that larger players have money and a far greater capacity to fight these cases. Of course, there is the worry that, if they lose, they will face huge legal bills. We know that small-business people have gone into business often leveraging their homes, taking on financial burdens and employing people. This means, in effect, that small players are discouraged from taking action to enforce Australia's competition laws. This is contrary to the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will address the difficulties small businesses face in getting access to justice under Australian competition laws. Small businesses are too often discouraged from pursuing strong cases. This bill empowers small business to go forward to enforce our laws to ensure that the legal system is fairer for everyone and to ensure that true competition applies. Consumers are the winners in that situation. This is a win-win bill. I encourage those opposite to support this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  I am pleased to follow Senator Ketter to speak in support of the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, which has been lodged and introduced by Labor. It is another sign that, despite the government's rhetoric to the contrary—and I will come to that a little bit later—Labor does have a very good understanding of the real needs of small business and is prepared to take action via introducing legislation like this to back in small business and ensure that they do get a fair deal and a level playing field.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has dealt with small business or has run a small business understands that small businesses do face many barriers to taking action, especially against anticompetitive behaviour by the big end of town. One of the reasons for that is that big businesses do invariably have deep pockets and armies full of my former profession, lawyers. The risk of small businesses being overwhelmed and having to pay big business's legal fees is a significant obstacle when they are considering standing up for their rights. Unfortunately, even though this inequity has been recognised for a very long time, the Turnbull government has, nevertheless, refused to address this inequity. That is despite the government's own Productivity Commission and competition review saying that small businesses are disadvantaged in the court process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, I am very pleased to speak in support of this private member's bill introduced by Labor. As its name suggests, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 will help deliver some level of access to justice to small business. It will restore the balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in a court case. For those who have not been involved in litigation before, first of all I say: well done! It is something that is very well worth avoiding if you ever get the opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the strengths of our system of litigation, particularly compared to the American system, is that, generally speaking, if a party brings legal action against another, particularly for a civil claim, they do have to think twice about whether that legal action has good prospects of success and whether it is frivolous because, at the end of the litigation, Australian courts do typically award costs to whichever party succeeds in a case. So, if you bring legal action against someone and make a claim against them, you need to think about the prospect that, if you lose, you may be facing quite a hefty order to pay at least a portion of the successful side's legal costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, I think that is actually a good thing in our legal system. We do, from time to time, see what seem to be absurd examples of litigation in the US, and I think everyone would acknowledge that the US's legal system is pretty out of control compared to Australia's. We hear terms like 'litigation frenzy'. It is a much more litigious society than our own, and I think that one of the reasons for that is that, generally speaking, American courts do not order costs against an unsuccessful party in litigation, so there is not a tendency to issue adverse costs orders, and that means that people in the US can, pretty much without any repercussions, initiate legal action even though it may actually not have very much prospect of succeeding. We do not have that system in Australia. We have a system where unsuccessful parties in litigation run the risk of having to pay the successful party's legal fees, or at least a significant proportion of them, so that does give people pause for thought before they charge into a lawyer's office threatening to start legal action. Of course, the downside of that is that, if you are a smaller player, whether a small business or an individual, the fact that you may, at the end of a litigation, need to pay the other side's costs, again can be a bit of a deterrent from taking legal action which might actually be warranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a lawyer, I have had many occasions where I have advised small businesses and other smaller parties, whether individuals or families, who have come to me with what, on its face, seems to be a reasonable claim—a claim that, though you never have a 100 per cent guarantee when you start legal action, on its face looks like it might have a reasonable prospect of succeeding—but, as the person's lawyer, you are obviously duty-bound to inform them that if all goes wrong and they do lose then there is a possibility that they could be up for the other side's legal costs. I have certainly personally advised more than one potential client about that, only to see them say, 'It's just not worth the risk,' even though they may have had a reasonably strong chance of succeeding in their legal action. The kind of work that I did—acting, usually, for plaintiffs—meant that they did not have the same level of resources as companies that they would take on, and very often they would weigh up the risks and decide that it just was not worth the risk of getting an adverse costs order. So that is a deterrent to litigation and sometimes does tilt the scales a bit too much towards big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So our bill, Labor's bill, seeks to restore that balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in a court case. As I say, we do not want that used frivolously. We do not want that to open the floodgates to litigation. So one of the other things that this bill provides for is: when a small business seeks a no adverse costs order early in a court case, a judge would have the ability to decide that, if the case has merit, the small business will not have to pay a big business's legal costs. So there is a check and balance in there. An application would need to be made to a court, and a judge would still need to weigh up the evidence. It would not be a full hearing of the case, because that in itself would run up massive legal costs. But this bill seeks to get that balance right, giving small businesses the opportunity to present their case, or a portion of their case, and have a judge determine whether the case has some merit and then have the ability to issue a no adverse costs order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also enable the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be successful. Again, we do not want people just trotting off to court and starting up legal action that has no prospect of success and that inevitably will result in an adverse costs order. This bill provides a capacity for small businesses to get some advice, prior to taking legal action, about whether a no adverse costs order is likely to be successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Working as a lawyer for over 10 years, I have had many instances where I have advised small businesses and other clients about their chances of succeeding in litigation, and they have weighed up the costs and the benefits. Most recently, before I entered the Senate, I practised in the area of class actions, which is a relatively new area of law in Australia. It has been going a lot longer in the US. I had the privilege of acting for individuals and small businesses in a couple of fairly large class actions. One was on behalf of shareholders in the National Australia Bank, and that was an action essentially about misleading the share market to do with the subprime crisis in America. Another class action that I was privileged to be involved in was on behalf of hundreds of horse breeders and horse owners and other people in the horse industry, who brought a class action against the Commonwealth in relation to a massive quarantine failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention this because many of the clients that we were acting for in those two class actions—and the firm I worked at obviously runs many more than just those two—were small businesses. If you spoke to them, there was no way that an individual shareholding small business or an individual horse industry small business could possibly have had the resources to take on either the National Australia Bank, in the first case, the shareholder case, or the Commonwealth of Australia, in the case concerning quarantine failures. These people had absolutely suffered some sort of financial loss through the wrongdoing of either the Commonwealth or the National Australia Bank. There was always going to be the matter of having to prove that it was the fault of the defendant, but there was no doubt these people had suffered financial losses, some in the thousands of dollars, some in the tens of thousands and some in the millions. But, no matter what size of loss they had suffered, there was absolutely no way they had the resources to fight a prolonged legal battle against some of the biggest defendants in the country, who would roll out their armies of lawyers and paralegals to review every single document. They would incur millions and millions of dollars in legal costs and invariably drag out a court case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Class actions tend to run for three or four years. They are long, complex pieces of litigation. But there is no way that the ordinary small business out there can undertake that kind of legal action on an affordable basis. And that is one of the reasons we have seen a growth of litigation funding in Australia, where class actions can be run by plaintiff law firms, who have the security of getting their fees covered as the case rolls on. But the clients, the small businesses who take this legal action, only end up having to pay back those legal costs if they have a successful outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that our class actions system in Australia, with litigation funding, has evolved to an extent that it does provide access to justice for many small businesses, who can band together, rather than each taking individual action against a large defendant for a similar wrong. They can band together with dozens or hundreds of other businesses or individuals who have suffered similar losses as a result of the same wrongdoing. They can come together and have someone else pay their legal fees and take the risk of an adverse costs order if the action is unsuccessful. That way, they are able to get access to justice which they would not be able to get on an individual basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, while it is true that our class actions system and litigation funding system in Australia has evolved to an extent that it can provide access to justice to people, there are nevertheless some cases which are too small to be run as a class action and be viable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that, as I say, they are long, complex cases where legal fees are expensive. If you are talking about a loss that has been suffered by people of, say, $10 million to $20 million all up, at one level that is a large amount of money, but, once you get legal costs taken out of that, there would not actually be a lot of money left over. That is the kind of instance that this bill will support. It will give opportunity to small businesses whose losses are not so great that they can afford to take the risk of incurring lots of legal costs and incurring adverse costs if they are unsuccessful in their action. We want to make sure that small businesses that have suffered relatively smaller but significant losses can still have their day in court. That is a pretty basic right in the Australian legal system, and this bill will enable that by giving some level of protection for small businesses that they will not face an adverse costs order if they bring a case that does have some merit but, at the end of the hearing, fails. All in all, this bill will give small and medium businesses greater power to enforce their rights under Australia's competition law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I wanted to touch on in my contribution to this debate is an incredible misconception which has been perpetuated by conservative parties and some of their supporters in the business community over many years—that is, only those in the conservative side of politics are friends of small business. It is one of those mantras that we hear from conservative parties—and I can see my friend Senator Smith over there agreeing with that mantra. Well, he is wrong, and not for the first time. I know it is an article of faith in conservative parties that they are the defenders of small business and that Labor is anti-small business. If you have a look at the facts, you will see that nothing could be further from the truth. I will be honest—there are some issues that, from time to time, Labor takes a different position to—</span>

                    </a>  I will come to that, Senator Hume. There are times when Labor takes a different position on issues to some parts of small business. Penalty rates is an example of that. We have heard some small businesses be vocal about their desire to see penalty rates being cut. But equally—and this does not get quite as much attention—there are many small businesses out there that are quite happy to pay penalty rates to their employees. And they remain so despite the decision of the Fair Work Commission, backed in by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in the duty electorates that I represent in Queensland there have been high-profile examples where small businesses have come out publicly and said that they want to stand by their employees. They understand that, if they pay their employees properly, and if all other small businesses do so as well, that will ensure there is a flow of money coming through a particular town that can be spent in other small businesses. It does not help small businesses to impose a massive wage cut on employees of those businesses, because all they are going to do is keep their money in their pocket and not spend it in the neighbouring small business down the street. I can think of a butcher's store near Yeppoon in Central Queensland which has come out publicly and said that they are going to continue paying penalty rates to their workers on Sundays—and good on them. Lush, who are a retail chain that sells bath products that my wife likes to go and spend lots of money on all the time, have said that they are going to maintain penalty rates for their employees. Again, good on them! They are taking a broader view than the penny-pinching view that some businesses take, which is a very short-term attitude that sees them cut back on their wages bill without understanding that what they are actually doing is cutting their own throats by reducing the amount of money that is available for their own customers to spend in their own business and in the businesses down the street.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with an example like penalty rates in which conservative governments and conservative parties hold up as something that all small businesses hate, it is actually not the case. There are many who understand that supporting their workers with decent wages actually enables the entire society and entire communities to prosper, which in turn creates more jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reflecting on my very brief time as a state member of parliament in Queensland, and I well remember some of the conversations that I had with small businesses in my old electorate, particularly in the suburb of Albany Creek. There was a jeweller that I used to run into from time to time. He ran a jewellery store that was, basically, a family business. His biggest complaint was never things like penalty rates or tax issues, or the things that conservative governments trot out; his biggest complaint was that he could not get any fair treatment by the shopping centre owner, who kept on lifting his rent and lifting the payments he had to make to the shopping centre owner for utilities, whether it be electricity or water or other things. There was nothing he could do as an individual small-business owner to take on the shopping centre owner. There was no way that he would have the resources to wander into court and take up what seems to be quite a legitimate claim and quite an abuse of the law by a shopping centre. There was no way he had the resources to do that and in addition face the risk that, if he lost any legal action, he would potentially have to pay the costs of the shopping centre owner in that litigation. This bill will help people like Wayne Goddard, who ran that jewellery store, and will help many other small-business people right around the country. It will give them the ability to take up legitimate legal action against big business without the fear of having to pay a massive legal bill at the end of a case if it does turn out to be unsuccessful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the other things that small businesses raise with me as impediments to their business: I was in Rockhampton last week meeting with small businesses there, and one of the biggest complaints that they had was the difficulty they have dealing with big business and having no certainty about orders placed for their products by big business. That was what was stopping them putting people on to work for them. They did not know from month to month whether their major big business customers were actually going to keep ordering from them. We heard that from farmers. We heard that from manufacturing firms who were supplying to some of the biggest multinationals in the mining industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are the kinds of things that are stopping small business from growing. We do not hear anything whatsoever from this government about how they are actually going to support them and how they are going to overcome those problems. Instead, this government, like conservative parties before it, just keeps on pulling out the old bottom drawer, pulling out the tax stuff, pulling out the penalty rate stuff and ignoring the fact that there are many small businesses who are quite comfortable with arrangements as they currently stand and actually have real problems, different problems, that this government is ignoring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you speak to any small business in the country, whether it is someone who is operating from their home or from a small shop, the first thing they are probably going to hit you up with is the NBN and the failure of this government to provide a decent telecommunications network which will allow them to operate quickly and efficiently, and communicate with their suppliers and their clients and people overseas. This government has had a gross failure in the provision of decent telecommunications infrastructure in this country, particularly through the NBN. I am sure someone must have done some kind of analysis of the impact that that has had on economic growth. They are the real difficulties that small business is facing in this country and they are the things that this government should be concentrating on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular in this bill, this is another attempt by Labor to even the playing field between big and small business. It will give small businesses their day in court for the very first time, and I would hope that the alleged supporters of small business sitting opposite might rethink this and support the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  What incredible hypocrisy. I have never heard anything like it: an attempt by Labor to level the playing field between big and small businesses. That is extraordinary. I know you have heard those words, Senator Watt, come from this side of the chamber, but I have to put my hand on my heart and say it is the first time I have ever heard it come from your side of the chamber. The Labor opposition have constantly opposed good quality, sensible, pragmatic policies that this side of politics, that this side of the chamber, have put forward to look after small business—those 3.2 million businesses that currently employ more than six million workers. Indeed, they are the engine room of the economy. Senator Ketter was right in saying that. They are the small businesses that we go to every day. They are the small manufacturers, the fish and chip shop down the road, the bakery, the small grocery on the corner—these are the people that keep our economy going, that keep our economy alive. Only a coalition government genuinely looks after small business. Labor looks after big business. It looks after its big business, big union mates, but it never comes to the rescue of small business, not with any genuine credibility. This bill is no different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am rising today to speak about the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017. This proposed bill from Labor, if enacted, would see private litigants given a power to request a no adverse costs order at any stage of a competition case. That is a part IV action under the Competition and Consumer Act. That is any stage of a competition case that they have brought before a court under proposed subsections 82(3) to 82(4). If a court grants such an order, the legal fees of the defendant would be prevented from being transferred to the litigant. In order to make a no adverse costs order, a judge must be satisfied that the action has a reasonable prospect of success and it raises an issue that may be significant for persons or groups other than the applicant, and that the disparity between their respective financial positions of the applicant and respondent is such that the respondent could use the possibility of a costs order against the applicant as a means to deter the applicant from pursuing the action. That is in proposed subsection 82(5).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed bill would enable the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide assistance with advising private litigants on the arguments that might be made and the evidence that is needed to satisfy a court to grant that no adverse costs order, and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman would provide assistance preparing those arguments under this bill's proposed section 15(c) and 74B of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Act 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will come as no surprise to have heard previous speakers in this chamber say that the government does not support Labor's bill. The main reason it does not support this bill is that the bill overpromises and yet will fail to deliver its objectives. There is no point in Labor promising access to justice for small businesses when the current law, section 46, is broken. If Labor is genuine about supporting small businesses, then they should support the government's changes to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of the chamber, it is probably worth giving section 46 some context. On 24 March 2014, the government commissioned an independent competition policy review, known colloquially as the Harper review, of Australia's competition framework. The key focus of the Harper review was to identify impediments across the economy that restrict competition and reduce productivity. It was described as the first root-and-branch review of Australia's competition laws for 20 years. The review panel, chaired by Professor Ian Harper, undertook extensive consultation with businesses, consumers and other industry stakeholders. The misuse of market power was one of the top issues raised in submissions to that review, with stakeholder opinions divided as to the efficacy of section 46 in deterring anticompetitive conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 March 2015, the Harper review released its final report. The report made 56 separate recommendations on Australia's competition framework. Those covered most sectors of the economy, with implications for almost all levels of government. In examining the misuse of market power provisions, the review panel considered section 46 to be deficient in its current form. On 16 March 2016, the government announced its final position on the Harper review recommendations and agreed to adopt in full the review's recommended changes to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer emphasised the government's commitment to strengthening Australia's competition policy. They commented:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">... the amendment of section 46 to deal with the unilateral and anti-competitive conduct is an important step to ensure Australia has the best possible competition framework to support innovation and boost economic growth and jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer MP, explained how those proposed amendments would support and promote pro-competitive conduct in business for the ultimate benefit of Australian consumers. I quote the minister. She said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments will make markets work better for the benefit of all Australians and help to lift our long-term productivity growth. They will ensure that all business can compete on a level playing field—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 46 is what is broken. This bill is entirely unnecessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to section 46 that the government has proposed will genuinely level the playing field for small businesses to ensure that they compete on merit against those businesses that have substantial market power. The changes to section 46 balance the small business to big business market relationship and will do far more to assist small businesses than the proposed bill under discussion today. These changes are necessary and they are championed by the small business sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of proposed legislation is expensive and time consuming. Labor's policy encourages small businesses to engage in litigation—it actually actively encourages it—and potentially that could be vexatious legislation. It does not, however, assist in the resolution of disputes at the earliest available opportunity or at the least cost to parties and to the courts. Labor's policy will, in fact, do the very opposite: it will encourage businesses to commence litigation. The applicant and proceedings will still have very high legal costs and a high evidentiary burden in challenging legal thresholds to establish a breach of the current section 46. The seeking of the order itself carries with it a legal cost in satisfying the court that the order satisfies the hurdle tests—a cost which would be borne by the small business applicant. And, if the court grants a no adverse costs order, the applicant must still fund its own case, and the case is likely to be complicated by the legal argument about the facts and addressing the expert advice brought by the respondent. The costs to the applicant for its own legal representatives are still very likely to be high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, most importantly, is the role of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The functions given to the ASBFEO would require the ombudsman to provide legal advice on the prospects of obtaining an order, and that is not at all appropriate for a public statutory office of this nature. It is not clear how a party who took up litigation on the basis of such assessment and subsequently did not obtain an order in their favour could then withdraw from litigation without a cost penalty. It is also not clear what liability the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman would have should the party not be successful in obtaining an order in their favour. A party in receipt of a no adverse costs order would be incentivised to take up belligerent litigation tactics, which are very unhelpful for the presiding judicial officer and for the other party who is acting in good faith. As it stands, this bill would allow a party to request a no adverse costs order when it becomes aware that it does not have a reasonable prospect of success, rather than withdrawing the case, which is what should happen in these circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would also fundamentally change the role of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman from advocacy and assistance. In particular, the addition of this function would severely limit the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's ability to advocate on issues. Advocating and assisting are what it does. They are its two key functions. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman advocates under a number of different activities, including conducting inquiries and research, working with other realms of government, contributing to other inquiries and promoting good business practice, and it assists because it understands the challenges that face small business owners. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman provides dispute resolution services for those who may be involved in a disagreement so that they can try to provide a solution to the problem without having to resort to costly litigation. The provisions of this bill fall outside the current remit of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and would create an undue burden on that office. Additionally, Treasury does not consider that the Labor Party's estimates of the cost of $1 million reflects the full cost of this policy. Small business is indeed the engine room of the economy, but the Labor Party is no friend of small business.</span>

The schools package is a large and complex arrangement which covers all schools in Australia. The funding agreements the Commonwealth has released are only for the Commonwealth. States will be required to have to look at the arrangements and make their own commitments. At this stage, state governments have not been provided detail about funding in this complicated package.</span>

The only information available to stakeholders and parents is a website which outlines funding arrangements based on the government's new policy. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There needs to be sufficient time to assess the impact of these measures across the system. Committee meetings across the winter break will ensure that all parents, teachers and stakeholders can have their say. It will also ensure that states and territories are not blindsided by a rushed legislative package from the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The higher education bill contains the government's latest higher education reform package, which represents a wholesale cut to universities and an impost on students. The nature of this package is also complex. There are $3.8 billion in cuts. Students have to pay more and faster, and a significant amount of analysis needs to be done. This includes measuring the impact of how repayment changes for HELP impact young Australians, especially at a time when they are entering the workforce, trying to save for a house and start a family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package also flags around $500 million a year, or 7.5 per cent of the Commonwealth grants to universities, being pulled for performance funding. It is unclear how this will work. Universities are concerned about the implementation of this with its potential to be a 7.5 per cent cut. Further, the impact of the efficiency dividend and changes to postgraduate courses will have a significant impact on Australia's nearly 900,000 domestic university students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe greater scrutiny is required, and this is required through a considered committee inquiry. The government has had a year to devise this package. We believe the sector should have more than four weeks to allow the Senate to analyse it. So, in terms of our amendments, we would seek that both of those bills were referred to the education and employment legislation committee for a reporting date of 9 August to allow those proper consultations and scrutiny to occur.</span>

I think it is a good compromise. A 9 August reporting date for both of these bills does give a substantial amount of time to look at the consequences. I want to be clear: I do know that there are some people and voices out there wanting certainty about what their funding models and funding packages will look like. And we have heard that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I rise to talk to the Disability Services Amendment (Linking Upper Age Limits for Disability Employment Services to Pension Age) Bill 2017. This bill amendments the Disability Services Act 1986 to link the upper age limit of the Disability Employment Services Disability Management Services program, referred to as DMS, to the age pension eligibility age under the Social Security Act 1991. The key change to the bill involves the removal of the reference to '65 years of age' and replaces it with the term 'pension age' as defined under the relevant subsections of the Social Security Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill. Labor has a proud record of supporting vulnerable groups in our society. Labor is proud of the track record of support for people living with a disability and very supportive of the Disability Employment Service Disability Management Services that have enabled disability clients across the country to access a range of services that assist them. A gap in service provision would be created without the amendment to this bill. Labor also notes that the financial impact of this recommendation is a modest one, estimated to be $4.6 million over the forward estimates. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I rise to speak to the Crimes Amendment (Penalty Unit) Bill 2017 on behalf of the opposition. At the outset, I indicate that the opposition will be supporting this bill. This bill implements a Labor policy from the 2016 federal election to increase the value of a penalty unit. Penalty units are the metric that we use to set the maximum fines that can be imposed for Commonwealth offences, such as fraud, firearms offences, drug offences, white-collar crime and workplace crime. By increasing the value of a penalty unit, this bill will increase the pecuniary penalty for all Commonwealth offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Keating Labor government that first introduced the penalty unit in 1992. When it was first introduced, the value of a penalty unit was set at $100. Since then, successive governments have updated the value of the penalty unit. It increased to $110 in 1997, $170 in 2012 and $180 in 2015. This bill will increase the value of a penalty unit from $180 to $210, which will be indexed every three years to CPI. This higher value will apply to offences committed after these amendments come into force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong penalties are an important way we deter crime. This is why this increase to the value of a penalty unit was one of our election policies. Labor believes it is important that our penalties are not weakened as the cost of living increases. But strong penalties are meaningless if crimes are not detected, investigated and prosecuted. This week we found that the government has cut over $184 million from the Australian Federal Police over the next four years. Because of these enormous cuts, the AFP will lose over 150 personnel next year, with many more cuts to come as they struggle to make up for the funding shortfall. This government likes to talk a tough game on law and order, but it is Labor that proposes smart policies and it is Labor that resources our law enforcement agencies. Labor is committed to keeping Australians safe. The Labor policy that this bill implements reflects this commitment, so I reaffirm that the opposition will be supporting this bill.</span>

Today, the major parties are waiving through the Senate increases in fines that will rake in an extra $90 billion of your money over the next three years. Fines will be increased by 17 per cent, far in excess of inflation, since the last increase in fines two years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's increase in fines overrides existing indexation arrangements, which adjust fines every three years in line with inflation. The next adjustment is not due until 2018. It is an ad hoc increase that undermines our legal integrity. When the parliament has introduced fines into the law, it has done so with the view that the fine matches the offence and that the punishment fits the crime, but, with the passage of this bill, fines will be harsher than the parliament intended. I encourage the courts to take this into account when they next impose a fine. I oppose this bill.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this Parliament's recent passage of a bill to establish the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (IPEA), I am pleased to introduce the Parliamentary Business Resources Bill 2017. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill is the next step in the biggest reforms to the management of parliamentarians' expenses in more than a generation. It is the new foundation on which we will build the instruments that prescribe all future parliamentary work expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will see the implementation of a number of key recommendations of the review chaired by John Conde and David Tune into the parliamentary entitlements system, by streamlining the legislative and administrative framework for parliamentarians' work expenses into one single head of legislative authority—this was one of this Review's key recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of other recommendations of this Review will also be progressed through this Bill, including: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Changing the outdated terminology of "entitlements" and "benefits" for parliamentarians to "work expenses";</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Introducing the principle of value for money travel to ensure that we spend taxpayer's money carefully and responsibly;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Imposing a 25 per cent penalty loading on work expenses which are claimed incorrectly; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Providing a clear definition of "parliamentary business" so parliamentarians can be more confident about whether their individual's use of taxpayer funds, particularly when it comes to travel, is within the rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through the introduction of an independent authority which can make rulings, a clear definition of 'parliamentary business' along with increased transparency, the Government is moving to restore public confidence in parliamentarians' expenditure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As this government has previously said, the current parliamentary expenses framework is complex and challenging for both parliamentarians and the public to navigate and understand. It comprises multiple pieces of legislation, regulations, determinations, procedural rules, guidelines, conventions and decisions of executive government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is time for a simpler, more transparent framework that governs our use of public resources to conduct our parliamentary business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are many benefits in establishing a simpler parliamentary work expenses framework. A simpler, clearly defined framework will not only better guide and support parliamentarians in making confident, responsible decisions, but it will enable increased public awareness of the expenses and allowances that can be claimed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This, in addition to the monitoring, auditing and reporting functions of the soon to be established IPEA—including the more regular disclosure of parliamentarians' expenses—will facilitate a greater degree of transparency, accountability and integrity in our use of taxpayers' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A simpler framework will also reduce the administrative load on parliamentarians and their employees, allowing us to spend more time doing what we are elected to do—serving our constituents and community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">New rules and obligations will be placed on parliamentarians to ensure that we spend taxpayers' money carefully, and only for purposes that relate to the duties we undertake as their parliamentary representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under a new <span style="font-style:italic;">dominant purpose test</span>, parliamentarians will be prevented from accessing public resources under the new framework, unless it is for the dominant purpose of conducting parliamentary business. This test will be the standard that we must meet in order to claim work expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In keeping with the recommendations of the review, the bill will specify that parliamentary business means parliamentary duties, electorate duties, party political duties, and for office holders—official duties. The bill will authorise the Minister to make a legislative instrument that specifies activities under each of these four duty streams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will also require us to ensure that our use of public resources achieves value for money—that public resources are used efficiently, effectively and economically. This is consistent with the obligations on Commonwealth public servants for the proper use of taxpayers' money. It is appropriate that it also applies to our use of public resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Parliamentarians will be personally accountable and responsible for assessing what represents value for money, and must be prepared to justify publicly their use of taxpayers' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Parliamentarians that claim expenses for a dominant purpose other than conducting parliamentary business or who breach conditions relating to claimable work expenses, will be personally financially liable for the costs associated with the work expenses, and subject to additional financial penalties under the penalty loading scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The penalty loading scheme will impose a 25 per cent penalty loading on top of the cost of an expense or allowance that does not comply with the rules, and which is not repaid within 28 days from the date the claim was made. The penalty scheme will not apply where there was an administrative error by the Commonwealth. Nor will it apply where a travel expense or allowance was outside the rules, but in incurring or claiming that expense or allowance the parliamentarian reasonably relied on advice from IPEA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this, it must be acknowledged that it is imperative that parliamentarians and their staff are able to receive guidance and support to ensure that we access work expenses within the rules and abide by our obligations. This is particularly important in relation to the travel we undertake to fulfil our representative duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will provide IPEA with the power to make written rulings relating to travel expenses and allowances. IPEA may provide a ruling on its own initiative or at the request of an individual parliamentarian. Rulings will conclude whether a travel expense or allowance was within the rules, including whether it was for the dominant purpose of conducting parliamentary business, or represented value for money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A ruling is conclusive evidence of the matters it deals with. Where a ruling finds that a parliamentarian has incurred or claimed a travel expense or allowance beyond the rules, the amount claimed or incurred will be a debt to the Commonwealth and a penalty loading will apply if not repaid within 28 days of the claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, as I have already mentioned, a debt will not exist where a parliamentarian claimed or incurred the travel expense or allowance in reliance on personal advice given by the IPEA. This ensures that parliamentarians can receive personal advice which provides them with certainty of what travel expenses and allowances they are able to claim. The Department of Finance will continue to provide advice on work expenses other than travel, but such advice or expenses will not be the subject of a ruling by the IPEA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the Prime Minister has previously identified, as parliamentarians we have a duty to ensure that our use of public resources meets the expectations of all Australians. Following the establishment of IPEA, this bill is the next step in a robust response to the obvious shortcomings of the existing system. The bill will provide greater clarity to parliamentarians in their use of taxpayers' money while further increasing transparency and accountability on such expenditure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My hope is that this bill will also go some way to restoring the public's confidence in the parliamentary expenses framework which has arguably degraded the public's view of parliamentarians over recent decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I look forward to working with the opposition and other members and senators to ensure that this very important next step to timely reforms to parliamentary work expenses is delivered as soon as possible.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill makes consequential amendments to relevant legislation, including the repeal of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952</span>, to facilitate a new simplified 'principles-based' parliamentary work expenses framework.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill also provides for provisions to assist with the transition from the old work expense framework, to the new work expenses framework.

This is another piece of long-awaited reform. As I have stated on previous pieces of legislation before this house, ever since the former member for Mackellar decided that a helicopter was an appropriate form of travel we have needed these reforms. The independent review undertaken by eminent Australians, including David Tune and John Conde, into the parliamentary expenses framework recommended a series of changes and improvements to the current system. Together with the recent statements of the Remuneration Tribunal, we are pleased to see these changes now being brought forward. The changes before the chamber seek to refine the definitions of 'parliamentary business', define the principles on which we base our expenses decisions and begin implementing the reforms so strongly recommended by the review. I note that the opposition knows the majority of the parliamentarians just want to abide by the rules and get on with the job, which is why the opposition gave a guarantee of speedy progression of this legislation to reform the system to restore public faith and to get on with the job.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  The Greens strongly support the Parliamentary Business Resources Bill 2017 and the Parliamentary Business Resources (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017. The issues of transparency and accountability with regard to how politicians use public money to undertake our work is something that we do feel strongly about. It is an issue that we have taken up regularly over many years. I will come to it later, but right up front I wanted to pay tribute to the work that former leader Christine Milne undertook in this area. She spoke in this House many times on this important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard from the government that the foundation of these bills is that they will build instruments that prescribe all future parliamentary work expenses. Understandably—it is the government—they want to present what they are introducing in a very positive way. They present with great fanfare that this is a new beginning. As I have said, we support it, but to get that new beginning we have to ensure that the misuse of resources does not occur and that the transparency and the accountability is real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems with these bills is the lack of penalties. People do do the wrong things. In the future, people who may be here in these chambers already or who may yet be elected will do the wrong thing. There is less chance of that happening if there are penalties in place and much clearer compliance measures. What we know from reading these bills is that the measures do not include clear compliance and penalty provisions. That is needed for the reasons I have just given: to really put it out there so it is much clearer and people are less likely to do the wrong thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also need the penalties to help restore public confidence in us as politicians and in the very institution of parliament. I am sure one thing we would all be aware of is the deep cynicism among the public about who politicians are and what we do. I was told—and I have not got the source of it—that a poll recently found that 74 per cent of politicians are in this work for themselves. I find that really disappointing. Although I have strong disagreements with my colleagues, particularly on the coalition side and also on the Labor side—we all have our differences—I still believe by far the majority of people, within their own set of values, are here working for what they believe is the common good, irrespective of what we might think of this. But the public do not think that. The public are so deeply cynical. What becomes so damaging when the public end up in that space is that they are less likely to engage with the democratic process. So this bill is really important, but it needs more teeth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is all very well for the minister to say that the Turnbull government is committed to comprehensive reforms—and I have heard him say that a number of times and I do acknowledge the work he has put into this—but, again, without those clear penalties and a willingness to enforce them—a willingness to follow through on the penalties also has to be part of this—government reforms in this area will not carry the cultural change that is needed. It is not just the words we get into this bill; it is how the place is operated and how it is seen to operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see that there is a need for a compliance officer position to oversee MPs' use of their allowances. There should be offences for the misuse of allowances or disregarding reporting requirements. The compliance officer should make regular reports to parliament on the status of the investigations of any misuse of allowances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest round of tidying up how allowances are managed by politicians started with a helicopter ride. Unfortunately, you find that so many of the reforms in this area start because there are scandals. I have to say that I am not convinced that what we have here is going to plug the hole on those scandals. We had the former member for Mackellar's helicopter ride to a fundraiser. The former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, did actually order the inquiry. That inquiry, chaired by John Conde and David Tune, came forward with a whole set of recommendations. One recommendation was for the body that we are now considering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to revisit that because it has taken so long for this recommendation to be put in place. The former Prime Minister set up the inquiry, the inquiry brought down its recommendations and we got a new Prime Minister, the member for Wentworth. Yes, there are a number of recommendations, but not too many to consider—I think there are just over 20. It took them more than a year to announce that they will bring forward this recommendation for the establishment of the body we are now considering. That is a good step, but the time lag is again not a healthy look. It just sends the message to the public that they are not really serious about it. Why didn't they really get on with it when the problem became so clear?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many aspects dealt with here. I mentioned earlier the work of my former colleague in this place Christine Milne. She and I pay tribute also to the Nick Xenophon Team, who have also done work in this area. Former senator Christine Milne was very passionate about this issue. She spoke in the parliament many times. It was on her initiative that we developed the Greens bill for a national integrity commission. Part of the national integrity commission was the office of an independent parliamentary adviser. That is something that was needed long ago. Maybe it would have prevented the crazy helicopter trip that brought such embarrassment not just to one MP but, I would argue, to the whole institution of the Australian parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we had such an adviser, they would be there to advise MPs and ministers and we could get clarity on what is sometimes a bit of a grey area in terms of some of the work that we might undertake—'Is it something that parliamentary resources should be spent on?' So we could get that clarity. Also, they would be able to assist in the ethical running of our offices and generally assist in what the standards are that the public expects regarding the right way to operate. I believe that such a position would help address that issue I spoke about earlier regarding the need for cultural change—the advancing problem that we have—which this bill only takes forward in a very small way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to remember why we are here. We have different approaches to our job, but we are here to serve the Australian public. We need to ensure that, when we are using public money, it is done in a way that is accountable and transparent. We need to ensure that the money is being used in a way that advances the interests of the Australian public and is not for self-interest or being abused in any way. We need to ensure that, every time we claim an expense of the many resources and allowances that we are provided with, we and the public can be confident that these resources and allowances are being used in the right way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support many of the aspects that are set out here in terms of value for money and being very clear about what is parliamentary business. But the issue around the penalties is something that really needs to be revisited in detail. It is a major weakness, and we are not seeing movement from the government in this area. I acknowledge that one aspect of the bill provides that, if an MP refuses to pay back money that they owe within 28 days, there is a 25 per cent loading on their repayment. I would argue that that is not enough. It is too low, and I cannot see that it would operate as a discouragement or disincentive to MPs. These aspects need to be completely tightened up to ensure not only that the rules and procedures are followed absolutely but also that the public can be clear that the right thing is being done and that we are not going to have another morning where, when we wake up, the front page of the newspaper is about the abuse of travel allowances or the misuse of any of the other allowances that we are afforded with to undertake our work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole issue of allowances is an area that needs work. I would argue that the Parliamentary Business Resources Bill 2017 is only one small step in the work that needs to be undertaken. The Greens are ready to support it, but we hope that there will be in-depth consideration of those hard issues—for example, how we can put penalties in place that will make a difference, will be enforced and will act as a disincentive to MPs who might consider doing the wrong thing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0Q" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cabinet</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  This being my bill, I will take a moment to respond to some of the comments made in the debate on the Parliamentary Business Resources Bill 2017. Firstly, I would like to thank the chamber and members of the committee who worked on this for their cooperation in allowing this bill to be brought forward today and for their cooperation and discussions that have led to its development and passage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been in this job since August last year, and I think anyone who has been around politics will know that the occasional scandal or negative story about expenses, entitlements and travel has been something that predates more than just the last 18 months, two years or indeed three years. This bill is a significant bill because it brings together a lot of legacy legislation, different regulations and different acts of parliament—things that I will not describe as hodgepodge but rather as things that developed over time to deal with the new needs of members of parliament and also, occasionally, the need to act in response to a misuse or a mistake. It is a significant piece of work, because one of the pieces of legislation that is being amended is older than me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will agree with one sentiment expressed by Senator Rhiannon—if it does not do her too much damage for me to agree with her on something!—and that is that this has been an issue developing over a long period of time. This has been an issue that has damaged the institution of parliament over a long period of time. But it is an issue that I and the government have seized upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So far this year, with the consent of this place, we have finally abolished the Life Gold Pass—which was promised for nearly three years; abolition was immediate, so that people who had it lost it—because it did not meet community standards. We have actually established, for the first time—and it is now an executive agency and, from 1 July, will be a statutory independent agency—the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority. I will say to Senator Rhiannon, as to a number of the requests that you have made: the ability to receive advice and to oversee, and the power of audit, are vested in that parliamentary expenses authority that this parliament brought in within a month of the Prime Minister's announcement. That does reflect the cooperation of other people in this parliament, but it also reflects that the can was not kicked down the road by this government—not by me; not by the Prime Minister. We said we were acting and we were committed to action, and this is the third tranche of legislation dealing with these problems this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the Conde report, it did take some time, Senator Rhiannon. I was not in the portfolio until August last year. However, it did take a substantial period of time to draw together all the different legislation and regulations, as it will when we have to bring out the update to the parliamentary expense regulations that will be a consequence of this, because we do not want any inadvertent consequences; we do not want inadvertent loopholes; we do not want inadvertent restrictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say, however, that I do not agree that fines are the best way to discipline members of parliament. In this place, we vote on gravely serious matters, whether that be national security policy or taxation policy. We need to give members of parliament the flexibility to do their jobs. When people say to me: 'Why don't you just have a travel budget? Why don't you have stricter rules?' I say: 'How does that work for someone from Melbourne versus someone from north-western Australia—for Senator Dodson, or someone like you, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, from Western Australia?' And I do not think that, if we are going to be voting on such issues of national import, we cannot be trusted to make a judgement on how we use these business expenses to go about our jobs, to meet with stakeholders and to go to committee meetings et cetera.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best discipline is the regular reporting that we are bringing in, because, as people have rightly noted, it is the six-monthly reporting that has actually drawn public attention to this in the past. That is going quarterly, immediately, and, as we update the information technology, which is more than a decade old in some cases, that will become monthly. That regular reporting and the ability of the public to access that online will be the best forms of discipline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also need to be careful. Not everything that is written up in the newspapers is a misuse. Sometimes there can be an innocent mistake. Sometimes there can be a slip of judgement. Not everything is a conspiracy. And that is why, in the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority that goes with this, we have actually provided the power to provide advice and to provide binding rulings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How it plays publicly and how it is going to be received by the public is a judgement we should all be capable of making—after all, we are all elected officials. But I hasten to say that part of the issue around the standing of members of parliament is the bidding war that happens as members of parliament seek to convict people in a court of public opinion before all the facts are known.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has to deal with the queries we get, I will say: some of the stories I have seen, particularly, I might say, about members from regional Australia and the travel costs they incur, I think paint them in an unfair light and do not fairly represent the travel burden on them, nor their correct use of entitlements, nor the fact that—to ensure that people living long distances from Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney can actually see a member of parliament—there are going to be substantial travel costs involved, and I am more than happy to defend those. So I think we have just got to be careful to ensure that one error of judgement is not a career-ending moment, or that, if there is one genuine mistake in applying the rules—which tends to happen more often than conspiracy does, I think—we do not leap to a conclusion about the motives of that person. That is why we have put in place an independent authority with the capacity to provide advice confidentially and to provide rulings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I genuinely thank those who have facilitated the passage of this bill, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  The legislation before us today in the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Polar Code) Bill 2017 is the latest step in the process of international cooperation to protect not just Antarctica but also the northern Arctic region. Antarctica is the last great wilderness and we need to keep it that way. Decades of international cooperation has protected the icy continent from much of the environmental degradation we see in other parts of the world and, while much of this is partly to do with isolation and the extreme weather conditions, it is nonetheless a wonderful thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation amends the existing Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to incorporate Australia's obligations under the new International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters, which is also known as the Polar Code. The Polar Code was developed by the International Maritime Organization, which is the United Nations agency responsible for improving maritime safety and preventing pollution. It came into operation on 1 January this year. While we realise the code is not perfect—indeed, moves are already in train to strengthen it—the opposition will support this bill, as we see it as an important positive step forward. Protection of the environment is a responsibility that we all share. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Polar Code sets out minimum mandatory requirements for the design, construction, operation and manning of vessels that operate in Arctic and Antarctic waters. Its creation amended the safety-related provisions in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the environmental protections in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the changes in this bill, all large vessels operating in polar waters will need to hold a polar ship certificate. To be certified, a vessel will need to undergo a survey to check it meets the requirements of the code. Certification will be conducted by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and will cover a vessel's structure, fittings, machinery, electronics, communications and navigation equipment, as well as its fire safety and lifesaving capacity. The code also toughens rules on the discharge in polar waters of oil, noxious liquid substances, sewage and garbage. In particular, it provides for fines of up to $360,000 for the discharge of sewage within three nautical miles of an ice shelf or fast ice. In addition to the bill before us, the government also proposes to amend the Marine Orders of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to ensure the code is properly implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In practical terms, these changes will affect very few Australian vessels. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Aurora Australis</span>, which is the government's Antarctic research and resupply ship, will definitely to comply, as will the vessel that replaces it in 2020. However, it is expected that growing international trade will increase the number of vessels passing through polar areas. For example, it is expected that by 2020 about 15 per cent of China's trade, worth about $500 billion, will pass through the Arctic. As trade increases around the globe, it is critical that the international community stays ahead of the regulatory game. Just one major accident could have dire consequences for the environment. Very serious damage can be caused by maritime accidents, particularly those involving the release of oil. One of the greatest risks of accidents in polar areas is isolation. In the event of an accident in these areas, it can take a long time to get clean-up crews in place. That makes clean-up operations costly and difficult. That is why we need tougher standards for polar areas. We need to do everything possible to reduce the likelihood of accidents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there is broad support for the new code internationally, there is also an acceptance that more needs to be done to protect our polar regions. Indeed, a select committee of the British parliament has called for another wave of reform to toughen even the measures we are putting in place today. The committee's 2015 report points out that black carbon, heavy fuel oils and discharged ballast water all pose threats to the Arctic environment and that these issues need to be addressed as the code evolves. Some of the issues that the next wave of reform should examine include further toughening of the minimum structural requirement for ships and the fact that the code applies only to ships with a gross tonnage of more than 500 tonnes—meaning that it excludes fishing boats. As well, while the code covers the management of ballast water and antifouling paint, complying with these provisions is voluntary. It also allows for food to be thrown overboard as little as 12 nautical miles from the ice, which, for example, is not allowed in the Mediterranean Sea. These are the types of issues that are already on our forward agenda. The New Zealand government has produced a proposal for phase 2 of the code, and it would be a great place to start the next wave of reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has an excellent record when it comes to protecting the Antarctic. We were one of the founding signatories to the Antarctic treaty in 1959, which placed restrictions on activities in the southern continent other than scientific research. Since then, the Hawke Labor government played a leading role in the development of the 1991 Madrid protocol, which imposed a 50-year ban on mining, prospecting and exploration in Antarctica. So Labor comes to this issue with strong credentials and a demonstrated willingness to take a reformist role. That is as it should be. This parliament has a responsibility to further generations to continue to play a central role in the protection of Antarctica. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  I rise to speak to the Personal Property Securities Amendment (PPS Leases) Bill 2017 on behalf of the opposition. At the outset I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the bill. Labor introduced the Personal Property Securities Act in 2009. This historic reform provides a uniform functional approach to personal property security law governing all transactions that, in effect, create a security interest. This includes the national uniform Personal Property Securities Register in which security interests may be registered and searched. The Personal Property Securities Act 2009 harmonised over 70 Commonwealth, state and territory laws as well as the common law and rules of equity that govern security interests in personal property. The laws varied in their application according to the form of the transaction, the nature of the debtor or the jurisdiction in which the property was located, which had the potential to significantly add to transaction costs. Other countries, notably New Zealand, Canada and the United States, had all implemented reforms in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PPS reforms were intended to have a significant impact on business and consumers, enhancing Australia's position as a financial centre by enabling banks and financiers to gain greater access to international finance, which would in turn assist growth and employment in Australia. The reforms were the subject of extensive consultation and received significant support and input from stakeholders, including industry, financiers, business and the legal industry. Labor are proud of these reforms. The PPS reforms constitute real regulatory reform that cuts red tape, lowers costs for businesses and improves productivity. This stands in stark contrast to the Liberal government's imagined commitment to so-called red tape removal that involved amending legislation with minor, unnecessary changes like deleting commas and correcting typos. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to extend the minimum duration of a PPS lease from more than one year to more than two years. The amendments will operate so that a lease of an indefinite term will not be a PPS lease unless and until it has run for more than two years. The effect of these amendments is that a PPS lease of more than two years is a security interest that should be registered on the PPS Register. The provisions of the act relating to PPS leases operate to prevent the owner's loss of property that can occur in security arrangements where the goods are in the possession of the borrower. If a borrower uses property as security for subsequent borrowing, sometimes the second lender is not made aware of the owner's existing security interest. The register of personal property securities ensures that lenders are able to identify security interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, Labor introduced the act with bipartisan support to establish a register of personal property securities to streamline the more than 23 different state, territory and Commonwealth regimes for registers of interest in personal property and over 70 pieces of supporting legislation. The aim of the PPS reform was to improve the ability of individuals and businesses, particularly small- to medium-size businesses, to use more of their property to secure lending. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent Supreme Court decisions in New South Wales and Western Australia have interpreted the operation of the act in relation to PPS leases. If owners of property do not register their interest on the PPS Register and a hirer uses the property as security for borrowing without the knowledge of the owner and the hirer becomes insolvent, the liquidator has an enforceable right to the possession of the property. This has raised concerns for small businesses, particularly for the hire and rental industry, whereby owners of the property have lost the right to their property because their interest was not registered. Property owned by hire companies can be lost when a customer defaults or becomes insolvent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is required to review the operation of the act. The Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, launched the review in April 2014 and it was led by Mr Bruce Whittaker—the Whittaker review. The final report was tabled on 18 March 2015. In response to problems identified by small business in relation to PPS leases during the Whittaker review, the government enacted the Personal Property Securities Amendment (Deregulatory Measures) Act 2015, with Labor's support, so that certain categories of leases do not need to be put on the PPS Register. The Whittaker review highlights the concerns of small business, which are partially addressed by this bill: low levels of awareness about the act leading to a failure to engage with the registration process and adverse consequences or loss of property, the need for professional advice about the operation of the act due to its complexity and the cost of that advice, the financial and administrative burden of the registration and search process, and the cost of resolving disputes relating to the operation of the act. In particular, some in the hire and rental industry have struggled with the operation of the act due to the imposition of significant administrative burden and substantial compliance cost as well as the desire to remain flexible in lending equipment to the construction and mining sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small and family businesses that do not have the resources to meet the financial burden of the act are vulnerable to loss of property. The bill responds to the concerns of small business, particularly the rental and hiring industry, which commonly lease goods out for short-term or indefinite arrangements to a large number of customers by limiting the type of lease that is captured by the act. However, I note that the final report of the Whittaker review stated that the concept of the PPS lease was the subject of far more comments and criticisms in submissions than any other topic, particularly from the short-term hiring industry, which were especially vehement in their criticism of the fact that their hiring activities are subject to the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note the Whittaker review did not recommend the changes in this bill which amend the one-year test to a two-year test. The review explicitly recommended that the one-year test not be changed. This was due to a concern that ownership interests would be less visible if they were not covered by the act, as well as the concern that it is often very difficult to say whether a particular lease is a security interest under the act. The one-year test adds clarity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the Whittaker review also did not recommend the changes in this bill which provide that a lease of an indefinite term will not be a PPS lease unless and until it runs for two years. It was recommended that the definition of PPS lease be amended to capture a lease of goods for an agreed term of more than one year, taking into account renewal options, or for a period of initially less than one year once the lease has in fact continued for more than one year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Whittaker review also recommended that the definition of a PPS lease be amended to remove all references to bailments. A reference to a bailment means that many normal commercial arrangements, which should not be regarded as leases, are caught by the act. This results in a lack of confidence and certain business activity falls within one of the exclusions in the act. That issue is not addressed by this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the opposition believe some aspects of this bill could have been improved, particularly to address concerns of small business, on balance, we support the bill. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I wish to contribute to this debate on the Personal Property Securities Amendment (PPS Leases) Bill 2017 by saying that, in 2015, I had a meeting with James Oxenham from the Hire and Rental Industry Association and their legal representatives Oliver Shtein and John Elmgreen. They explained to me that the hire and rental industry was suffering badly from an unintended consequence in the PPSA and that companies were losing their property when the lessee went broke. This is because they had not properly lodged security over the equipment by not completing the required paperwork and online registration or completing it incorrectly, or not completing it in the correct time frame. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A classic case is a matter of Alleasing Pty Ltd, which lease plant equipment worth $23 million to OneSteel manufacturing. Alleasing registered an interest in the equipment on the register but included OneSteel's ABN, not their ACN. The administrators ruled that this made the registration defective and invalid and, even though Alleasing lodged a fresh registration and then went to court, it lost the case and its $23 million worth of plant and equipment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are not immune either—this is a matter happening as I speak. Three farmers leased dairy cattle to a fourth farmer and, unfortunately, his operations failed and the liquidators moved in. Because the farmers either were not aware of the necessity to register under the PPSA or completed the paperwork outside the required time frame, they have been embattled with the bank and the liquidators as they try to get back at least some of their cattle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a long road to get here. I raised this 18 months ago in the joint party room when these people came to me. The current exemption period is one year, and the industry want that extended to three years. A big part of this was the banks, because they are the ones who appoint receivers. But, even if they do not appoint, any assets lost to the insolvent company under the PPSA usually end up in the hands of the bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Forge Group liquidation, ANZ successfully claimed turbines owned by another company worth more than $50 million. So I got the two parties together—the hire companies and the banks—and a period of lease, which can be maintained free of PPSA risk regardless of paperwork, was agreed on for the two-year period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will amend the act's definition of a PPS lease to ensure that it captures only leases which are long enough to necessitate registration on the PPS Register to meet the act's objectives. Leases with an indefinite term will require registration only once they have exceeded two years, and the length of a fixed-term lease will require registration only if it is for a term of more than two years. This will fix what I call 'legalised theft'. This is a good outcome for the hire and rental industry, which has an annual turnover of $6.6 billion and employs more than 18,000 people. It is a win for common sense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, for bringing this legislation forward and also his adviser Jules Moxon, who is sitting here in the chamber—good on you, Jules. He worked with the department to develop the changes needed. I think Jules would refer to me as 'Three Horses' because, every time I went over to see him, I was simply: nag, nag, nag. We have got there, and I thank you very much, Jules. I commend the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Labor welcomes the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Bill 2017. This bill has been a long time coming—three years in fact. While the government has been delaying progress, Labor has been pressing for change to ensure that copyright material is accessible for people with a disability. In 2013, when Labor was in government, we took the lead in negotiating the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. The Marrakesh treaty allows people with a disability access to printed copyright materials, such as books, without requiring them to get express permission from the rights holder. This treaty is essential to ensuring that printed materials remain accessible to those with a vision or print disability and to removing uncertainty over who is breaching copyright in creating those more accessible formats. This bill will import the principles of the Marrakesh treaty into enforceable Australian copyright law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might surprise you to hear just how limited access to books and other literature currently is in Australia for those that cannot access the printed version. With current copyright restrictions in place, only five per cent of books that are published will ever go through this accessibility conversion. Without the Marrakesh treaty, serious limitations prevent access to literature. The principles of the Marrakesh treaty change the prospects of learning and reading for those who are unable to access printed materials. I cannot exaggerate just how beneficial this treaty and the copyright law amendments that will be made in honour of this treaty will be to people all over the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been lagging in this area. The United States branch of a website named Bookshare has almost 500,000 book titles available in formats alternative to print. The Australian branch of this website currently stands at less than 25,000 available works, all because of the current limitations within our copyright law. With this bill, Australia's existing copyright law will be amended to expand the number of titles available in alternative formats. Vision Australia, a leader in this area, will be able to carry on with their work in increasing accessibility to printed materials, unburdened by the fear of offending irrelevant and unnecessary copyright laws. In September last year, at the implementation of the Marrakesh treaty, Vision Australia's General Manager for Accessible Information Solutions, Mr Michael Simpson, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Having access to quality information allows people to make decisions and choices in life. The lack of information in accessible formats puts people with print disability at a huge disadvantage with their sighted peers. With more available content the playing field for this community can start to be levelled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot put myself in the shoes of someone who has lost their sight. With the copyright legislation as it stands, loss of sight equates to a loss of access to the knowledge and delight that is offered by books and other literature. This bill offers a solution that will increase access to the written word for those with a print disability. I am very proud to be part of the Labor-driven movement that has ensured that this reform will happen. It is worth noting my disappointment in the length of time that it has taken this government to make this clearly necessary change. These amendments only ensure compliance with the already signed Marrakesh treaty. This is not the first time that we have seen delay by the government to reform in this area. It took enormous pressure from Labor to convince the government to actually sign the Marrakesh treaty back on 24 June 2014. After signing, it was not until December 2015 that the government saw fit to ratify the treaty. The treaty finally entered into force on 30 September 2016. Here we stand, nearly six months after the ratification of the treaty, still waiting for the necessary legislation to implement the spirit of the treaty into Australian law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in this bill we have reform that might give more certainty to those in the disability sector on what is and is not a breach of copyright law. It is good to see that the government is taking it upon itself to take this treaty seriously. We also appreciate that the government has pushed these changes off from the earlier controversial exposure draft bill. It is only appropriate that changes to access to literature for people with disability be removed from some of the more politically delicate areas of copyright law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disability access to printed materials is not the only agenda of this bill. Other important copyright changes are covered. Included in this bill are the preservation of copyright material by libraries, archives and other institutions; use of copyright material by educational institutions; and harmonisation of copyright terms for published and unpublished works. Overall, this bill will simplify exceptions to the copyright law as they currently stand, allowing libraries and archives to make necessary preservation projects and by making necessary copies. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I would like to add a couple of comments on behalf of the Australian Greens in which I substantially agree with Senator Brown's comments on the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Bill 2017. I want to acknowledge the former Labor government, both for initiating Australia signing the Marrakesh treaty and also for bumping a reference, back in 2012, I think, off to the Australian Law Reform Commission that actually set the wheels in motion for some of the very welcome changes that we see today. On that note, I would also like to acknowledge Senator Fifield's office and Senator Fifield himself for bringing this bill to us today. I will make a couple of comments towards the end of my contribution on the irony, I guess—maybe from a slightly different perspective to that of Senator Brown—of the fact that we are having to deal with this in 'non-contro', but let us start with what the bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Copyright, I suppose, is always going to be a balance between, on the one hand, the protection of the rights of people who create works of art or literature, or other intellectual property, to be fairly paid and to be fairly acknowledged for their work and, on the other hand, some commonsense public interest limits to those rights. Nobody is suggesting that that balance is easy, but these are the sorts of issues that we are grappling with here and that the government has brought to us in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues have obviously been brought into very sharp relief in the digital age, where it is not just that the volume of creation of work has exploded but also that the speed of distribution has basically completely overrun the rather brittle system of checks and balances, some of which date back to more than 100 years ago. In this case, we are amending a bill that was written in 1968. Back in 1968, the internet was confined to a few hundred devices in the hands of US research institutions and military agencies. Rolling the tape forward, it is very apparent that thousands and thousands of hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube every hour, and the tools of creation and editing and recombination have now been substantially democratised. It used to be that you needed to own a printing press or a video editing studio to be to create content. Now, of course, you carry around a printing press, a recording studio, a global research library and a distribution platform that can reach an audience of up to three billion people every time you pick up your mobile phone. That is what has substantially overrun the old distribution bottlenecks that present copyright laws were designed to protect. The distribution bottlenecks of the 19th and 20th centuries are not simply being eroded; they are being obliterated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst this free-for-all, we in the Australian Greens are absolutely and emphatically not in the business of saying that artists now have to work for nothing just because it is so easy to copy stuff. The costs of copying have fallen, effectively, to zero now that not everybody but many people are carrying these devices around. I have an arts background and I push back very strongly against the argument that, just because your output cannot be measured in tonnes, you should therefore be happy to see your creative output ripped off and shared without your consent. The point of balance here, obviously, is that we are also profoundly sick of the copyright-industrial complex and their desperate calls on governments to maintain these 20th century distribution bottlenecks, and their incumbency, through occasionally recommending breathtakingly punitive acts of parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give one example, if you are a big Hollywood studio, the idea that you can phase a cinematic release through different markets months and months apart, then string it out through release on DVD and then wring a few more bucks out of the property on scheduled television, those days are done. You simply cannot do that anymore. There is this thing called the internet that makes that kind of marketing rollout distribution strategy completely obsolete. The internet interprets these obsolete strategies as points of failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones</span>, obviously, is the example that is used ad nauseam. I do not know if this is correct or not, but it is frequently argued that Australia is the world's biggest illegal downloader of that particular media property. <span style="font-style:italic;">Game of Thrones</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>costs millions of dollars to create. It employs thousands of people around the world, and they have a legitimate right to get paid—the same as anybody else undertaking creative output. Of course, there is a significant, central, single reason why Australians were torrenting that series at such phenomenal rates: you had to get a really expensive Foxtel subscription and take on thousands of channels of trash, or however many there are these days, that you are not interested in watching just to watch the one thing at the same time as other people. And, as distribution is democratising and brought into the 21st century, people are happy to pay. They are happy to pay, and they are also happy to pay for curation of material as long as it is affordable and reasonably easy to get hold of. That is the 21st century distribution model, and that is where we will see those rates of piracy falling through the floor—as the distribution is brought up to date. Create the distribution channels, and people will pay.</span>

I want to acknowledge our colleague over in the other place Mr Ed Husic, who led the charge on the so-called 'Australia tax', which is basically media conglomerates and distribution incumbents charging Australians more for stuff because they can. And then they get Australian parliaments to pass laws to prevent people from circumventing that Australia tax. There are other and more sensible ways around issues like this. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen bills on online infringement. We have seen, effectively, an internet filter brought in on the basis of blocking legislation and on lobbying by the copyright industry to knock files sharing sites offline. And, most recently, we had the Productivity Commission, which reported in December 2016.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings us to the issues in the bill that, maybe, would have been controversial—and Senator Brown alluded to them at the end of her contribution. I would argue—maybe I am alone in this—that these things could have been brought in in non-contro time, because the Productivity Commission and the ALRC both recommended a fair use regime and a regime of safe harbours to protect those other than carriage service providers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will read a little bit from one of my favourite set of advocates on issues such as these, the Australian Digital Alliance, who should be congratulated today for helping the government steer these reforms through the parliament. They pointed out, on safe harbours, that the proposed changes were then knocked out of the final form of the bills that we are dealing with today:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This fixes what we believe to be a long-running "error" in how Australia implemented the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA). This error has restricted the application of the safe harbour provisions in the Australian Copyright Act to commercial ISPs ("carriage service providers"). This is in direct contrast to the approach taken in all other countries that have ratified a free trade agreement which includes this safe harbour language—including the US, Japan, Chile, South Korea and Singapore …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is gone. That is not here, and neither is fair use. A fair use regime has been a recommendation by, basically, anybody who is credible and independent of particular commercial interests who has taken the time to look at this issue. Again, from the ADA, a key recommendation is that Australia adopt a fair use exemption to copyright. The ALRC said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought that we could have seen those two important measures, which have been subject to really widespread, fine-grain review, brought into this debate today. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Obviously, that is something for a future government—either a coalition or a Labor government perhaps—that might consider that the weight of evidence stands very strongly on the side of passing these significant reforms to copyright law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to take away from the fact that today is the day for advocates, like Vision Australia and others who have been mentioned in the course of this debate, bringing Australian law into line with our obligations under the Marrakesh Treaty. Just to put this into plain English, under present law, if you use a text-to-speech reader to make a book or work of literature available to somebody with a vision impairment, you are breaking copyright law, and that is ridiculous. That is one of the things that we are fixing today. This is a really common sense set of reforms that manage to annoy no-one, and I congratulate the government on that. Such as it is, we think some important things have been left by the side of the road and will need to be dealt with, but it is unusual to find a bill relating to copyright that manages to get near-unanimous applause, as this bill has done.</span>

Today is really your day. We are very happy to commend this bill to the Senate and see it pass the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  Like our media laws, Australia's copyright laws are antiquated and reforms are very much long overdue. The current laws have failed to keep up with changing technology, which has rendered them clumsy and means they no longer act as intended—to balance the best interests of all parties. We are making a start with the measures in this bill to redress what has essentially evolved into a discriminatory circumstance where copyrighted works cannot be altered into user-friendly formats for sight and hearing impaired people. The primary purpose of this bill is to put in place measures to improve access to copyright material for people with a disability. It will essentially require rights holders to grant an exception and allow their work to be communicated or copied into accessible formats by universities, schools and libraries or by people wanting them for personal use if they do not already exist in a commercially available format. This is in accordance with the Marrakesh treaty that Australia ratified in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a necessary change to end the type of charade where a teacher cannot make a captioned version of a video for hearing impaired students in the class for fear of breaching copyright or where a school cannot provide a large-print version of required reading material in a timely way because it has to go through the cumbersome and costly processes of seeking permission from the copyright holder. It is very much a silly and discriminatory situation and we are happy this wrong will be made right through this long-overdue legislation. The bill will also allow authorised bodies such as libraries to make copies of works in order to preserve them without waiting for them to deteriorate first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we still need to go further—much further—to address the lingering copyright loopholes and failures that are inadvertently creating an uneven playing field for schools and businesses. If we look around the world, other jurisdictions are already moving on this. The European Commission has proposed to bolster the position of rights holders, such as newspapers and musicians, to negotiate fair remuneration for their content with online platforms such as Google, Facebook and YouTube. We have seen in the past week Fairfax journalists strike over massive looming redundancies. This is one of the consequences of the failure of copyright and competition laws to keep up with rapidly changing online commerce, where online platforms reappropriate or give users open slather to shared copyright content, often with impunity. Media companies in particular are being challenged on all sides. Australian media businesses do not need to prop up Google and Facebook's multibillion dollar businesses for free. Competition is fair enough, but the current situation, where these duopolies cannibalise traditional media content and profit from it without paying fair compensation, while also taking the lion's share of advertising revenue, has to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia certainly should consider the European Commission's proposals made last year to update and harmonise their copyright laws. Its proposal included a range of copyright reforms, including measures to facilitate digital access to published works by the vision impaired, consistent with the Marrakesh treaty, to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled, as this bill does. But, most significantly, it has proposed forcing online platforms to pay fairly for the content they host or allow to be shown via their platforms. It has put forward measures to improve the position of rights holders to negotiate and be remunerated for the exploitation of their content by online services which give access to user-uploaded content. Its proposal also contains new transparency rules so authors and performers can be confident that they are getting a fair bite of the revenue that online platforms generate from sharing their work. The European Commission's scheme also acknowledges the unique situation of media publishers and the fact that, to remain sustainable, they need to be able to enforce their right to recoup their share of earnings from the online platforms which appropriate—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much, Mr President. You see, the Labor Party are into these games where they ask questions where they already know the answer. It is all very juvenile. I would point out again to the chamber that the Australian Office of Financial Management publishes an issuance strategy for the budget year only, and that any projections beyond the budget year are based on a set of technical assumptions and will vary with changes in these assumptions and budget estimates and projections. So, based on these technical assumptions—and this is published in the budget papers, at page 7-8 of Budget Paper No. 1—by the end of the forward estimates period, gross debt is expected to reach $606 billion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:05</span>):  What former Treasurer Peter Costello has also said in the past, what we have said in the past—he is a giant of Australian politics, of course—is that the debt number that is actually the most relevant is government net debt. And government net debt, both in dollar terms and as a share of GDP, is projected to peak in 2018-19 at $375.1 billion and at 19.8 per cent, and then it is projected to reduce, reduce, reduce, reduce to the point where, by 2027-28, it is projected to come down to 8½ per cent of the share of GDP—8½ per cent of the share of GDP. The Labor Party are playing politics, but they cannot go past the fact that, if Labor were still in government, on the policy settings that they left behind after the most shameful period in government in the history of the Commonwealth, debt would be much worse today than what it is. We have made significant progress in reducing the level of debt, compared to what it would have been under Labor.</span>

This budget gives certainty to all people in Australia living with a disability, to their families and to their carers that their needs will be met as the NDIS moves towards full scheme in 2020. The budget provides $33 million over three years for a local care workforce package to help disability providers deliver the work that is needed to meet demand from people entering the NDIS, as well as older Australians requiring aged-care services. A new independent national body, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, will be established to oversee NDIS service standards and enforce participants' rights, at a cost of $209 million over four years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Significant reforms to disability employment services will also better connect jobseekers who have a disability with a job that is right for them. Significant reforms include allowing jobseekers to choose and change their DES provider, with funding following them to the provider rather than locking them into someone they are dissatisfied with; putting the responsibility on DES providers to attract jobseekers to them, rather than being guaranteed a certain number of jobseekers; and linking funding of DES providers to outcomes—jobs for people with a disability. This includes higher levels of funding for placing people with greater barriers to employment in a job or for securing employment in a more challenging labour market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this budget includes a proposal to increase the Medicare levy by 0.5 per cent from 1 July 2019 as the system ramps up to once and for all ensure that Labor's funding gap for the National Disability Insurance Scheme is addressed and these services—and the financing to provide these services—are sustainable in future decades.</span>

I think many, many Australians are also aware, as they have been for many, many years, because, despite promises, slogans and bumper stickers, the previous Labor government failed to fully fund the NDIS, leaving a substantial annual funding gap of almost $4 billion from 2019-20.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The claim that Labor makes that it fully funded it has no credibility when Labor's actual budget papers did not link any savings to the NDIS. That proposition only appeared in a little glossy document in 2013-14. That glossy document spoke about 'other long-term savings' that were not identified in any budget paper. When asked in Senate estimates whether these measures could be listed in detail, Treasury's response was: 'The short answer is no.' And, Mr President, may I say we can always go back to an interview on 2 May 2013 where, when referring to the proposal by Labor to increase the Medicare levy, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, said, 'I'm sure we will get bipartisanship.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that we have had a cyclone in recent times and that has had an effect—a temporary effect—this financial year on economic growth. But, if you look at the budget papers, the budget papers actually show that our expectation is that growth will again pick up in 2017-18 to 2.75 per cent and then three per cent in the subsequent three years. Just imagine if we had not pursued a strong and ambitious pro-growth agenda. If we had not pursued an agenda with better export trade deals, if we had not got rid of the mining tax, if we had not got rid of the carbon tax, if we had not pursued an innovation agenda, if we had not pursued an ambitious infrastructure investment project, if we had kept Labor's policy settings in place, imagine how much worse the situation would be that Australia would be in today. Our growth today is stronger than it would have been if Labor's anti-success, anti-growth policies had remained in place—the policies that we reversed—and if we had not pursued our very ambitious pro-growth agenda under the Turnbull government.</span>

Jobs growth in Australia today is better than what it was in Labor's last year in government. We have turned that situation around that we inherited from the Labor Party.

On Monday evening this week, Sky News reported that the budget would include a bank levy. The next day, bank shares fell nearly four per cent, wiping $14 billion off their valuations. It was also reported during budget day, the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span> reporting details about the bank levy and sources. Can the minister confirm if there was a leak from the Treasury and whether he is investigating any leak?</span>

There is no evidence, according to advice that we have received from Treasury, of any leak out of the lockup. But of course there is, sadly, in the lead-up to any budget, a lot of pre-budget speculation, and so it was on this occasion.</span>

When asked on 2GB why he could barely muster a slow clap for the budget on Tuesday night, the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, 'I gave the Treasurer the applause I thought he deserved.' I think, Mr President, that that quote is worth repeating: 'I gave the Treasurer the applause I thought he deserved.' If even Tony Abbott thinks that this budget deserves nothing more than a slow clap, what kind of Liberal budget has Prime Minister Turnbull overseen?</span>

The government lifted the debt ceiling to $600 billion in the lead-up to the budget, yet, as Senator Ketter has pointed out, budget papers indicate that total debt across all government agencies is projected to reach $725 billion. Some of the debt that is being incurred in the budget is through equity vehicles similar to NBN Co in the form of corporations to establish, for example, a $5 billion Western Sydney Airport and the $8.4 billion Melbourne to Brisbane rail project. Minister, what specific criteria was used to determine which spending by government counts as equity and which counts as general expenditure?</span>

The first point I would make is that capital investments are those that generate returns to the government over time, providing benefits for current and future generations. It is a matter of public record that this government is committed to delivering the Western Sydney Airport and, of course, we have made relevant announcements in recent times. Given that Sydney Airport was not prepared to take on, on their right of first refusal, the opportunity to develop the other airport, the government has decided to develop that airport with an intention to sell the airport once developed and operational. That is something we have already announced.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, in developing the Western Sydney Airport, for example, we are developing an asset that will have a value on our balance sheet. The reason it is treated as equity is that it is assumed to generate returns to the government over time. The specifics in relation to the total equity injections in this budget, including the profile over the forward estimates, are disclosed in table 9 on page 3-36 of Budget Paper No. 1. Also, towards the back of Budget Paper No. 2 you will be able to find the various projects that the government has decided to support with equity injections.</span>

Secondly—and I heard Senator Wong say that this is a very good question—there is a very straightforward answer: it is actually not the government that determines whether something is classified as an equity injection or as a grant; it is based on an assessment by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which is done quite independently. They, of course, assess based on what the expected rate of return is. In relation to whether that is a rate of return sufficient to qualify as an equity injection, in simple terms, it obviously has to be above the rate of inflation.</span>

Given that a truly conservative government would intervene only in cases of market failure, can the minister guarantee that there was no commercially competitive alternative to the government's rail project?</span>

Not every deal that comes from the private sector that is put to you as a government is indeed on closer scrutiny necessarily a good deal for the taxpayer. The government has—and this is a matter on the public record for some time now—gone through a robust market-testing exercise where all potential private sector partners in delivering the inland rail were able to put their proposals forward so that they could be properly tested and scrutinised. What we have done here in the context of the inland rail project, with an $8.4 billion equity injection through the Australian Rail Track Corporation and assuming that there will be further private sector investment to complement that as well as ARTC borrowings to deliver the full project cost, is based on the advice that came out of the market-testing process. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I know his strong appreciation of the importance of supporting development in northern Australia in particular. In many parts of northern Australia of course native title is the governing legal arrangement for the use of land. It is a different title from what most of us would expect. There are different arrangements in place. Because investments there go over a number of years, in mines, farms or other developments, there is a need for certainty to underpin investment and to underpin confidence from others around the world that they can come to this country and invest and create jobs in this country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of decisions in courts earlier this year uncertainty has been introduced. The government has acted quickly to remove that uncertainty and to restore faith in the system. We should act to do that because that is what the native title holders themselves want. That is what the National Native Title Council want. They have written to the government and said that they urge parliament to consider this bill 'as soon as possible'—their words. That is what members of the National Native Title Council who represent parties in this area want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland government have written to the government and Premier Palaszczuk said, 'I request that as a matter of urgency your government moves to amend the act.' They want the change to occur because they realise what this means for the state of Queensland and the importance of investment there. Indeed, the Australian federal Labor Party have recognised how important this is as well. On 31 March, Mr Shorten and others wrote to the Prime Minister saying, 'We're willing to work to achieve these objectives'—that is, to change the bill—'as soon as possible and we believe with the cooperation of government this matter can be resolved quickly in the next sitting of parliament.' That is what we are trying to achieve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There has been some suggestion that there is only one agreement at risk. But a letter from the National Native Title Council to the government makes the point that a number of ILUAs, Indigenous land use agreements, that are currently subject to the registration test due to deceased or non-signing RNTCs are at risk of not being able to be registered unless we act—a number of those agreements.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those agreements that is at risk is the agreement relating to the Adani Carmichael coalmine, which is supported by the local Indigenous people. It will provide thousands of jobs for Australians, including jobs for Indigenous people. But, because we cannot seem to do our job in this place, those jobs are now at risk and they are at risk because of the actions of the federal Australian Labor Party. I hope there are no claims from them tonight, from Mr Shorten and others, that they support jobs in this country, because their actions today in this place clearly show they do not support jobs. They do not support the creation of jobs in this country and they cannot make claims to the contrary tonight.</span>

On 23 April the Assistant Treasurer said: 'The housing package will be extraordinarily large. It will be far reaching. It will deal with all the groups on the spectrum of housing. It will be an impressive package. It will be a well-received package.' On last night's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>program, John Daley, of the Grattan Institute, said, of the budget's housing affordability measures, 'You'll need a scanning electron microscope to see an impact on prices.' Isn't it clear that, after months of promising the world that the budget would deliver on housing affordability, the budget's housing affordability package is a dud?</span>

To the extent that there is a housing affordability challenge in some parts of Australia, of course that is a function of demand and supply. To the extent that demand exceeds supply, prices go up. Once supply exceeds demand, prices come down. In this budget, the Treasurer and his team have been able to put forward a very comprehensive package of measures to boost supply, including through the release of Commonwealth land that is no longer required, which will lead to significant additional housing developments, and through a $1 billion infrastructure package targeting local councils, in particular, helping them to remove barriers towards the development of further land release.

I am absolutely delighted to outline some of the significant and truly nation-building initiatives the coalition is delivering through this year's budget. The government is delivering a record $75 billion in infrastructure funding and financing, including a $20 billion commitment to passenger and freight rail. The investments we are making will unlock the potential of our cities and our regions. The $8.4 billion for the inland rail will be nation changing. Others have been talking about it for years, but it is this coalition government that is delivering the inland rail. We will also invest $10 billion to establish a national rail program which will transform our cities and our regions by better connecting our cities, suburbs and surrounding regional areas right across Australia. Our commitment to rail as part of this year's budget also includes a $500 million regional Victorian rail package which will improve the regional rail network, including the North East line, the Gippsland Line and the Geelong Line, as well as a study into improving the Shepparton line.</span>

In addition to rail, this year's budget also sees a significant investment in roads right around the nation by investing $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway; $192 million into the Northern Territory as part of the Northern Australia Roads Program; in Victoria, delivering on the $392 million for 35 projects promised at the last election, such as the Echuca-Moama bridge; in South Australia we are investing $85 million to upgrade the APY Lands' main access road, which will support 55 jobs during construction; in New South Wales, we are finally making the Western Sydney Airport a reality, with a $5.3 billion equity funding injection.</span>

This year's budget builds on those investments and delivers another $1.6 billion in a $2.3 billion road and rail infrastructure package for Western Australia. To ease congestion and improve connectivity across Perth, we are investing $792 million for the Perth Metronet, which is a massive investment in that city's urban rail infrastructure, and will include projects such as the Thornlie to Yanchep line. We are also investing up to $490 million in the Forrestfield-Airport Link—a project that will support 2,000 jobs during the construction. But there is more. We are also investing $648.3 million in the Swan Valley Bypass, which will support 750 jobs during the construction, and that is just the start.</span>

She is indeed misleading the Senate. It is being very, very well received. There has been widespread support. Pricewaterhouse says bringing forward spending on close to $50 billion worth of infrastructure, including Sydney's second airport, the Brisbane to Melbourne inland rail, WA's Metronet and a widening of the City Deals program is a bold, positive move that will turbocharge productivity. The National Farmers Federation say that $8.4 billion for the Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail is the real crown jewel in tonight's budget, for the farm sector. This is a significant investment in the efficiency of our industry, better connecting our farms with new markets here and overseas. The Australian Automobile Association says the 2017-18 budget is a win for road safety. There has been incredible support for this coalition's budget that is going to take this nation forward into the future.</span>

It is fair that Australians have more jobs and better paid jobs, and that is what our Enterprise Tax Plan will deliver. Senator Wong, I should not have to explain this to you, because you were a minister of a government at a time when Mr Bill Shorten, as a minister, made the very same point: company tax cuts would enable businesses to employ more people and offer the people they employ better wages. For my money, Senator Wong, that is fair. And not only I believe it is fair; you used to believe it was fair and Mr Shorten used to believe it was fair. In fact, Mr Shorten used to advocate it, but he no longer does. I will tell you what else is fair, Senator Wong: Australians should pay for their fellow Australians who suffer from a disability. And that is what we have secured with this budget as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I am disappointed that I have to update the Senate in relation to the attack by the Daniel Andrews government on the tens of thousands of fantastic men and women in Victoria who put their lives on the line every other day of the week to keep Victorians safe. Instead of working towards a new enterprise agreement that recognises the important role of the volunteer firefighters, do you know what the Daniel Andrews government now wants to do?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wants to split the CFA. Why? Because it wants to satisfy the disgusting demands of Peter Marshall and the United Firefighters Union. What did the Daniel Andrews government also do? It actually brought in Simon Crean—those on the other side would know this—to try and negotiate a settlement. One might say, 'Good on them for trying.' But guess what? Simon Crean, himself, was so dismayed and so disgusted at what the Daniel Andrews government was doing that he was unable to do it. Then have a look at Victorian minister James Merlino, who is misleading—Senator McKenzie knows this well—those in Victoria in relation to why they are not finalising the enterprise agreement. Ironically, this week is volunteer recognition week. I can tell you, there is nothing that the Daniel Andrews government is doing to recognise in any way the fantastic work that the tens of thousands of men, women and, in some cases, children do to stand up and protect Victorians.</span>

Senators will be aware that the very first act of the Turnbull government after being re-elected to govern was to move decisively to protect the tens of thousands of men and women in Victoria, the fantastic members of the CFA. I again extend my thanks to those on the crossbench who joined us in standing up for those fantastic people. What did we do? It was very simple. All we did was ensure that enterprise agreements could not contain objectionable emergency management terms. All that does is prevent emergency services bodies from being able to support their volunteer operations. On this side of the chamber, we will never shy away from standing up for the good men and women of Australia, the people who really do make this country. We are proud to do what we did to ensure that the CFA in Victoria can continue.</span>

The answer is: it absolutely does not. What the government is planning to do by adopting the principles of the Gonski report, which you abandoned and never implemented, is to increase school funding on a needs basis by $18.6 billion over 10 years, which is an increase—let me say it again: an increase. It is the largest investment, by far, that any Australian government has ever made in Australian schools—ever.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bilyk, an $18.6 billion increase is not a $22 billion cut. I tried to explain this to you yesterday, but let me have another go. This is Labor Party economics for you: you dream up a pie-in-the-sky number, you do not suggest any way in which that pie-in-the-sky number can be funded, you then subtract an $18.6 billion increase from your pie-in-the-sky number and you come up with a nonsense figure. That is not a cut, Senator Bilyk. An $18.6 billion increase in funding is not a cut.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are we proud to have invested $18.6 billion extra in Australian schools; we are also pleased that we have embraced, for the first time by any Australian government, the equity principle of the Gonski report. Senator Bilyk, just like you do with the NDIS, it is all very well to engage in the rhetoric, but you have to show where the money is coming from to pay for it, and we have done so.</span>

Let me explain this to you, Senator Bilyk. As I tried to explain to your colleague Senator Wong, the $65 billion enterprise tax plan will ensure that Australian businesses have more money to employ more people and to pay the people they employ better wages. That is the way that you grow the economy. I should not have to make this point to you, Senator Bilyk, because your leader, Mr Shorten, some years ago made the very same argument—which he has now conveniently forgotten about. Meanwhile, in another area of social policy, schools policy, we are increasing the Commonwealth's contribution over 10 years by $18.6 billion and, unlike you, we can point to where the money is coming from.</span>

Let me tell you what the actual figures are. There will be an increase of funding for schools of 4.1 per cent per year from next year to 2027. That annual increase of 4.1 per cent every year over 10 years will represent an increase in Commonwealth funding of 5.1 per cent per year every year to public schools, an increase of 3.5 per cent per year every year for Catholic schools and an increase of 4.1 per cent per year every year to independent schools. So every component of the sector receives a substantial increase in current levels of funding every year for 10 years. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  In fact, Senator Abetz, we are not missing anything out of this budget. What is very clear about this budget is that it is a reflection of how out of touch and arrogant the Turnbull Liberal government is. In fact, because you are still in the chamber—through you, Madam Deputy President—let's go to Tasmania. Senator Duniam came into this chamber yesterday espousing what he said were great outcomes for the Tasmanian community. Well, he was wrong, because there is no money for infrastructure for Tasmania. He was trying to do justify announcements that had been made previously. The Mersey Hospital funding is not new money and has already been announced. But, because the government have no good news, they want to try and re-announce and re-announce. The Building Better Regions Fund is not specific to Tasmania. The Launceston City Deal was announced weeks ago—so nothing new there—and the Regional Jobs and Investment Package was announced at the election last year. Consequently, there was nothing new there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is new is that this government are so far out of touch that they are slugging ordinary Australians to put more money into millionaires' back pockets. That is what they are doing. Millionaires get a $16,400 increase in their pay—that is the difference between them and working Australians. And we know, because they seem to be so proud of it, that the government are moving towards trying to ensure that hardworking young Australians do not have the same access to university as most of the people in this chamber had. That is what this government are doing. They are not investing in young people. What they are doing is making sure that the big end of town is looked after—because that is what they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen senators from that side come in since Tuesday night trying to defend a budget that they cannot defend. We know from at least the last four budgets that this government have brought down that, yes, there is a bit of a sugar hit for a day or so until we actually drill down and expose them for the frauds that they are. It is quite clear that Prime Minister Turnbull cannot be trusted. Prime Minister Turnbull has let the Australian people down time and time again. He cannot be trusted with Medicare and he cannot be trusted to protect the health system. We know that he certainly cannot be trusted when it comes to education, because $22 billion has been taken away from every Australian child in this country. That is what the government have done in terms of education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen, yet again, unemployment and youth unemployment increasing in our home state. I am disappointed that Senator Duniam, who is in the chamber, thinks it is such a light-hearted matter to talk about young people and the unemployment rate, when we know what a severe crisis we have in our home state of Tasmania. The government are targeting young Australians. They are targeting people who cannot get a job, who are out there every day trying to get a job. What are the government doing? They are doing what they always do—that is, slug ordinary Australians to protect the big end of town.</span>

                  </a>  But we did a lot more when it came to aged care than what you ever did. I would have thought that you might have learnt something through the aged-care workforce inquiry that you had been on. I thought that you might have at least got a grasp of the issues that are fronting the Australian community and the aged-care sector. But, quite clearly, once you step into this chamber you say very different things to what you do through the media and within the community in Tasmania. I am bitterly disappointed. It just demonstrates that, in this chamber and in your own caucus, the Liberal Senate team from Tasmania has no influence whatsoever over this government—none. You had given a commitment that you would fight for community health centres in Tasmania and you have delivered nothing new in preventive medicine—nothing at all.</span>

The second one is you borrow more money. The third is you actually have to increase taxes. They are the only three ways. We all know what those opposite do. They promise, promise, promise.

Despite all the 'Ministry of Truth's' alternative truths trotted out by those opposite, let us just go back and remind ourselves of the facts. In 1996, when Labor lost government, they left us and the Australian taxpayers with $96 billion worth of debt. That took the Howard-Castello government 10 years to pay off—10 years of prudent financial management to pay off. In fact, 21 April 2006 was actually the first ever debt-free day. We had very high hopes back then that that would then lead to future governments living within the national means and being fiscally responsible. Sadly, we all know what happened. In 2007, those opposite inherited—and Penny Wong was part of that—not only zero debt but money in the bank. We had money in the bank. We could actually set up the Future Fund.</span>

You went on the most recklessly irresponsible spending spree, which will now leave Australians with at least $550 billion worth of debt—five times that that the previous Labor government had left us to pay off. And it took us 10 years to pay that off. Those opposite would have us continue borrowing or raising taxes, trading on the economic security of future Australians so that they can spend today. What have we heard from those opposite? They spend. In the three years that I have been in this place, I cannot recall those opposite ever once suggesting an alternative way of paying for funding and expenditure. Not only that, but we have tried many times in this place to put forward sensible proposals to reduce government expenditure, and what they do? They block, block and block. They do not engage in sensible negotiations to compromise to find a way forward. The people of Australia elected those opposite, as they did those on this side, to take hard decisions and do what is in the best interest of all Australians.</span>

You are the only one in your government doing so. You know why no-one is raising it: because under this government, debt has blown out to half a trillion dollars. From what they started with in 2013 to where they are now is an incredibly dark, dark hole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that dark, dark hole, the government has tried to be really tricky. It has tried to be really tricky and really clever with this budget. It has been crawling around in the dark for some time. Finally, it has decided to turn on the light and adopt Labor's approach for fairness. But, in doing so, they have tried their best to copy us, and they have failed. They have failed dismally. It fails the fairness test miserably. It fails on health. It fails to implement the Medicare freeze—in fact, Medicare cuts will stay in place for three years. On top of that, veterans' health has been cut as well. It fails in education. University students will pay more for their degrees, and pay earlier. University funding is down 2.5 per cent. It rips $22 billion out of schools compared to Labor's original Gonski deal. It fails on housing affordability, one of the most crucial issues facing our country. Instead, property investors will still get more government assistance than first-home buyers. It fails our economy, because growth is down, employment is down, wages are down and jobs are forecast to be down by 95,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only thing that is up is that nasty word that Senator Reynolds was willing to talk about: debt. The debt is up. The deficit is up. In fact, the deficit is 10 times bigger than the Liberals' first budget predicted. It is so bad, this budget—despite them trying to gild it as something that is fair—that during the question time that we just had the government's own senators could only get the gumption to ask two questions on the budget. Two questions! This is the day after. Here we are, the day after, with the big fanfare of fairness, and they have hit the wall already. They could only ask two questions on the budget. That is how good this budget is. That is how fair this budget is. That is how much they want to go out there and sell this budget. The reason they do not want to go out there and sell it is because they do not believe in fairness. They do not believe in fairness and they never have. I do not think there has ever been a time that I have agreed with Andrew Bolt, but today there is going to be a breakthrough! I have to agree with these words in Andrew Bolt's column today:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Turnbull is plagued by seeming a stand-for-nothing guy who blathers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Bolt has summed up Turnbull in that sentence, because he does stand for nothing. We do have, unfortunately, a Prime Minister who stands for nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party stands for nothing so much that it has tried to backflip on some of its fundamental ideological policies by introducing new taxes. At the same time, it has held onto some of them by, of course, ensuring it gets rid of taxes for the rich. We still end up with that old Liberal mentality of letting the rich pay little tax and attacking those on a low income. How on earth can you call a budget fair when you are attacking some of the lowest-income Australians and letting the rich get off scot-free?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  It is great to be able to contribute to this debate. I have to start by pointing out that today, of course, we expect to see the opposition leader hand down his response to the budget in the other place. I very much look forward to seeing what is in that document. Is it going to be the answer to all the criticisms that have been levelled at the government and everything critics think we have done wrong? I doubt it. I do not think many people listening at home today are going to be surprised to learn that opposition senators are criticising a government budget. I do not think anyone is surprised that nothing we do is right in the opposition's eyes. But, sadly, that is the coloured view they have and we just have to deal with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In taking note of the answers that we have provided, it is important to reflect on some of the questions that were asked. As Senator Cormann's first answer pointed out, this is not really about the substance of the budget; this is not really about ensuring that Australians get the best deal out of budget management by a government. This is all about juvenile student politics—'gotcha' moments, 'How much is this figure?' and trying to get people on those little points. Instead, it is important to focus on the substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take issue with points made by the two previous opposition speakers, Senator Polley and Senator Singh, that things have all gone down—things are bad. Hang on, what about the NDIS? Australia is a great country where we want to look after everyone. We want everyone to have the right to live a fulsome and whole life. The cynical question asked by Senator Wong, trying to link tax concessions for business—that they seem to be terming 'the big end of town'—as being paid for by the Medicare levy, when the point was made that the levy, which comes into effect in two years time, is going to fund the NDIS to support our most vulnerable. It was a cynical and disappointing move. I think Australians will understand that that is what that levy will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Senator Polley's point in her contribution suggesting that the state of Tasmania missed out in the budget, I urge her to have a look at the budget yet again and look at the points where we have been funded. It is ridiculous for Senator Polley to suggest that, because those things were not new announcements on budget night—despite the fact that they were in the budget and funded in the budget—they do not count. She is saying to the people of the northwest coast that their $730 million-funded Mersey Community Hospital is not important; it was not a coup for them. The certainty that they now have in having 10 years of funding from the Commonwealth government to support this vital piece of health infrastructure is not important, because it was not new in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you look at other infrastructure funding in Tasmania: Midland Highway upgrades from Epping Forest to Powranna—$19 million this year; Midland Highway safety works from Mangalore to Bagdad—$20 million; Midland Highway work south of St Peters Pass to Tunbridge—$10 million; Midland Highway upgrade of Perth link roads—$25 million. And Senator Polley says to this chamber that there is nothing in the budget for Tasmania? What are those numbers? I do not understand what she is missing here. There is the freight rail revitalisation for Tasmania, which is $12.85 million. And the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, on the issue of schools funding in Tasmania, the point has been made by me and others in this chamber before that, under the deal that the others claim is a cut—a cut to their imaginary money—Tasmanian schools in all sectors, government, Catholic and independent, in 2017 received the highest per student funding of any jurisdiction in the country, except for the Northern Territory. And then in 2027, by the time we get to the end of the deal, the same three sectors will also continue to receive the highest funding per student, except for the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest that Tasmania has got the raw end of the stick here and has not done well out of the budget is just completely wrong. I urge Labor senators from Tasmania, rather than trying to come in here and score political points, to actually go and read the budget and be honest with the Tasmanian people about what is in there for them, including the Mersey Community Hospital, the NDIS funding and the improved school funding for our state. I think that is what people expect—for you to be constructive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I look forward to the alternative budget and all of those mentions of Tasmania and all the money for Tasmania that is going to be in the alternative budget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  Before I move to discussing the effect of the budget in Central Queensland, I would just like to correct one thing out of question time. Senator Brandis, in answer to a question from Senator Bilyk, continued to maintain this myth from government that there has been no cut to funding under their school funding arrangements. I would like to table part of the government's own document, which was released when they made their announcement, which says very clearly that compared to Labor's arrangements the government's package represents a saving of $22.3 billion over 10 years—otherwise known as a $22 billion cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would mostly like to talk about today is yet another dramatic failure from arguably the biggest failure in the House of Representatives, and that is the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry. This is the member of parliament who was so irrelevant to her own government that she was kept in the dark over the election announcements the government made about the Shoalwater Bay Defence land expansion and the need to compulsorily acquire properties to go ahead with that. She has been a complete failure on jobs, and we are seeing increasing levels of unemployment and jobs walking out the door in Central Queensland, without any action from her. This week's federal budget is yet another gross failure from an incompetent member of parliament who does not deserve to be here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people will be aware that recently Rockhampton experienced another flood, its fourth flood in the last decade. I was up there during the flood and saw the damage for myself. As a result of that, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, made a very firm commitment that was backed by Jason Clare, our shadow minister for northern Australia, the other day. We are putting $25 million on the table to help construct this levee and to make sure that Rockhampton does not have to go through these floods over and over again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that a competent local member would get behind this and would actually be in the ear of her Prime Minister and her Treasurer, demanding money for this flood levee and threatening to cross the floor. You would think she would do whatever it took to get the money for her community. But instead all we are seeing from Michelle Landry, the member for Capricornia, is just more pathetic excuses and more dithering as to why she cannot get the job done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another incredibly embarrassing failure from her in Rockhampton's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Morning Bulletin</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>today. When asked about the levee, she said that there is a lot of contention over this, as many people outside of Depot Hill, one of the flooded suburbs, have concerns about the levee. But, when she was asked for a figure of how many people outside of Depot Hill have concerns, Ms Landry did not offer a number or an answer. That is because she is making it up as she goes along. Then she stuck to her line that full community support is needed before she is going to back a flood levee to protect her own constituents from flooding. But the article goes on to say that, unfortunately, Michelle Landry was not able to clarify what constituted full support. Is it 100 per cent? Is it 95 per cent? Is it  90 per cent? What about these locals and businesses in Rockhampton who have to go through floods, every couple of years at the moment, and have an incompetent local member who cannot get through the door to see her Prime Minister and her Treasurer to demand funding for her electorate?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the article Ms Landry desperately did not want to talk about the levee any longer, so she tried to put up the fact that funds had been provided to build the Yeppen bridge, which is a critical piece of infrastructure I have travelled on myself, and ensure that Rockhampton during these floods remained connected to Queensland for the very first time. The only problem with this, Ms Landry, is that it actually was not your government that got this done. Ms Landry is pointing to the Yeppen bridge, which was commenced and funded by the last federal Labor government. So not only is she incapable of actually getting money from her own government to build a flood levy; she has to walk away and talk about past federal Labor government achievements to try to detract attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no surprise that she keeps pointing to federal Labor commitments in her electorate. In the long list of projects she tried to pass off as being new projects that she managed to win in this budget she had in there a couple of projects that again were funded and commenced by the former federal Labor government. While Michelle Landry has been the member for Capricornia, this government has done so little to build infrastructure in her own area that she has to desperately try to pass off infrastructure that was provided by the last federal Labor government years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michelle Landry is like a dodgy used-car dealer who has an old, beaten up lemon of a car that no-one wants to buy anymore. She is dusting off the rust, winding back the odometer and trying to present it as a new car. There is not one new project in the list of projects that Michelle Landry has put forward as her great achievements in this year's budget. Instead, she has got yet another regional growth fund when we have already got three or four different funds operating for Central Queensland and none of them have actually spent any money or provided any jobs. Michelle Landry is not up to the job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Whish-Wilson today relating to potential leaks concerning the 2017-18 Budget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked the minister today a very important question about whether there had been any leaks from Treasury, specifically on the bank levy. I will give a little bit of background. The question I asked the minister was about a report on Sky News on Monday evening that the budget tomorrow would include a bank levy. The next day, when trading opened, bank shares were sold off and nearly four per cent and $14 billion or $15 billion was wiped off their valuation. Today nearly $19 billion still remains wiped off their valuation. I asked Senator Cormann if there had been any leaks from Treasury. Senator Cormann was very careful in his response.

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no evidence, according to advice that we have received from Treasury, of any leak out of the lockup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He did not say that he was not aware of other leaks prior to budget day, such as someone giving some information to Sky News. Instead, he tried to say that that was speculation. So I then asked him: why is it that Tony Boyd in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review </span>an hour before the lockup was talking about details around the design of the budget levy? He said two things. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In a move reminiscent of Labor's mining tax, Treasurer Scott Morrison is planning to impose a tax on the aggregate liabilities of the major banks, according to banking sources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Treasury Secretary John Fraser will call the big four bank chief executives on Tuesday night at 6.30pm before Mr Morrison delivers the bad news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The banks did confirm that they were called just prior to the speech, but clearly we had a journalist who had some information about the design of the tax, but it came from banking sources. So my second question was: was there government consultation with the banking industry around this levy? Senator Cormann said no. He was very careful in his answers. He said that there was no leak out of the lockup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My issue is: if there has been a leak prior to the lockup—and clearly there has been; you can call it speculation if you like, but speculation has got to start somewhere—then how do we know that there have not been other leaks to the banks or to other sources prior to the budget? The reason I am so interested in this is that, perhaps unlike other leaks that we see going into budget time, this was a particularly sensitive piece of information that related directly to the valuations of the major banks trading on the share market, and, potentially, could have been an opportunity for someone to short those banks and profit from that information. Nineteen billion dollars of value has been lost from the sector, but that is potentially a very big profit for someone who may have put in place a trading strategy around a fall in bank prices, had they known that price-sensitive information prior to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So all I did today was to ask whether Senator Cormann would investigate, so that we could rule in or rule out whether there had been any anomalous share trading, and trading in options—the most likely place for someone to have capitalised on price-sensitive information. That is all I have asked the Treasurer to do. He has said it is not necessary; he has got no evidence that anything has occurred. My point is: we have had leaks on a very sensitive budget measure—that is clear. How do we know, unless we actually look?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I have written to ASIC and asked them to look at share trading in the weeks leading up to the budget to see if there was any anomalous share trading. I think it is a very reasonable thing to do. Senator Hinch has written to the Federal Police asking for an investigation of leaks around this issue. I think the first step should be to check with ASIC and actually collect the information that would be necessary before we go that next step. So that is what I have done today. And I think Senator Cormann was very tricky in his response and answers to my questions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gender based pay gaps continue, as does occupational workplace segregation. Unfortunately and persistently, Australia has a highly gender-segregated workforce, and our gender pay gap has stubbornly hovered around 19 per cent for the past two decades. This means that, without positive action and intervention, we will continue to trap young women still at school into a lifetime of lost earnings and opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of Western Australia, the pay gap is a whopping 23.9 per cent. Some people say this can be attributed to the mining boom. That of course is a myth. The gap was there before and during the boom and remains there after the mining boom has long gone. It has historical links and industrial links, particularly related to the industrial laws which enabled employers in Western Australia, under the Court Liberal government, to offer rates of pay lower than the awards. Overnight, we saw rates of pay, penalty rates and hours of work fall in sectors where women predominantly work. Women caught in a gender-segregated workforce lost pay—mostly around $3 an hour—and the gap that was exacerbated then remains today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the globe, this workforce segregation is replicated, as women are concentrated in domestic work, health, aged care, child care, hotel work, retail, cleaning and so on. Women are less likely to be in regular paid employment. This lack of decent work, along with retrenchment, privatisation and outsourcing of public service, the promotion of export processing zones and the enormous growth in supply chains, now the dominant mode of global trade, has increased pressure on women. Women are migrating for work, and they work in the informal economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia we have seen open slather in some sectors of our economy, led particularly by unscrupulous labour-hire companies, with overseas workers getting ripped off and franchise companies such as 7-Eleven ripping workers off over and over again. Certainly in the Senate's visa worker inquiry, which I chaired, we saw evidence of labour supply chains going right back to the home countries from which exploited workers were drawn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Internationally, we pin our hopes on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is an opportunity to address persistent gender inequalities at work and at home and to lift up women's economic empowerment. It reaffirms the universal consensus on the crucial importance of gender equality and its important contribution to the achievement of at least 17 of the Sustainable Development Goals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, from 2008 to 2013, we had a Women's Budget Statement. Who would have thought that, after such a long period of time, this important statement—a statement made and tabled in the Australian parliament—would be scrapped? But that is exactly what Prime Minister Abbott did. This statement was dropped in 2013, and, despite Prime Minister Turnbull claiming to be a supporter of women, he too has failed. At this point, the Women's Budget Statement remains in the bin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many areas where the Turnbull government is failing women, but two which have international significance are worth mentioning in the context of the report I have just tabled. Since 2013, under the Liberal government, Australia has slipped from 19th to 46 place in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Global gender gap report</span>. Our international development funding for family planning services in developing countries has fallen from $46 million in 2013-14, when Labor was last in government, to under $35 million in 2014-15 and just $17 million in 2015-16. This is truly shameful, as one way out of poverty for women is to be able to control their own reproduction and fertility. Australia is a wealthy, healthy country with a stable democracy. Not only do we need to focus on and do more to erase the gender pay gap and gender segregation in our own country; we need to play our role in a positive way on the national stage.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commence by saying thank you to the secretariat for the enormous amount of work that they have put into this report and the report on medical complaints. We tabled our medical complaints committee report yesterday. We did not get a chance to take note, because we were very rushed. I want to make sure that they are acknowledged for the enormous amount of work that they have put in. We did two reports at once, and they have done an excellent job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People might think, 'What were you inquiring into the price regulation associated with the Prostheses List Framework for?' People may think, 'Isn't this a fairly boring topic. Why would you want to be doing that?' In fact, this is a very important topic. There are over 10,000 devices on the Prostheses List, commonly called the PL. The problem is that we have seen an escalation in prices and the cost of prostheses. With the rising cost of private health premiums, the concern is that the prostheses are, in fact, adding a lot to those costs and contributing to the increase in private health premiums.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to note that prostheses processes cost more in private hospitals than they do in public hospitals. Not only that, but it is an extremely complex process. The prices are set in a complex process. I have to say that, during the inquiry, there was a sort of three-way pointing about who is responsible for the increase in prices, why we cannot find out the prices and why we cannot find out how the process operates. I think it is very fair to say that there is a lack of transparency around the pricing process and the cost process. It is very clear to the committee that action needs to be taken to reduce prosthesis costs as soon as possible. In fact, that is one of our recommendations—we need to do that</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made 16 recommendations. They go to issues around costs. They go to issues around the process. They go to the number of prostheses on the list. As I said, there are over 10,000. They go to how the benefit price is paid. At the moment, with respect to the costs between the private hospitals and the public hospitals, the hospitals can negotiate. Our recommendations go to transparency in the process. They go to the collection of data. All of these are really important issues if we are going to address this matter. They also go to advice from PLAC, which is the Prostheses List Advisory Committee, which has a very important role to play in the setting of cost benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to be careful. It is very simple to say, 'We've got to reduce the prices of prostheses,' but we also need to make sure that, for example—as the evidence was presented to us—Australian manufacturers are not disadvantaged by that. We have some very innovative manufacturers and prosthesis device developers in Australia, so we need to make sure we are looking after those local manufacturers. To be clear, the list can only include implantable devices. But we now have technology developing where there are non-implantable devices that people are arguing should either be on the list or be included in this process as well. We also have implantable devices that dissolve. How do we address those particular issues? I am trying to paint the very complex picture of what is going on, but that should not deter taking action to address the issues that we have canvassed in our report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we have made 16 recommendations, which I urge the government to act on. The committee recommends that the nature and cost of services associated with the medical device on the Prostheses List be disclosed separately to the cost of the device. We could not even get down to that level of information. A number of times we were told, 'We can't tell you that information, because it's commercial in-confidence,' which also makes it even harder to get to the bottom of the transparency in the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also came up, as I was alluding to before, that the private health insurers point to the manufacturers, and the manufacturers point to the private hospitals. Relationships are negotiated for the bulk purchase of devices between hospitals and device manufacturers; again, we in the committee could not get to the bottom of the detail of that. But it is a very important issue, which is why we spent quite a bit of time in the report talking about transparency in pricing.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also touched previously on the issue of data. There needs to be better data collection. The committee recommends that where the Commonwealth decides that a prostheses registry is needed, the parliament should ensure that the registry is legislated for and collection of data is made compulsory. We also recommend that the government legislate for the compulsory provision of private hospital and day surgery data to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, in order for the government to get the reform process in place. We also note that there is some reform process underway, but we have made the point that there is clearly need for an expansion of that reform process. As I said, we need to be taking action to reduce the cost of prostheses as soon as possible. It is very clear that can happen. It is very clear that the benefits-setting model, which is being looked at, needs to continue to be looked at. We have also recommended that the 25 per cent market share rule, which was brought up to the committee, is addressed also. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank my colleagues on the committee because this is, as I said, an extremely complex issue when you are trying to come to the bottom of this list. I urge the government to have a look at this because it is a very serious issue and it is only going to get worse if we do not address it. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  I will be very brief. I think Senator Siewert as chair of the committee covered nearly everything that I think was of note in the committee report. I, too, want to put on record my thanks to the secretariat, who have been under great strain trying to deliver on the demands of each of the members of the committee and dealing with huge amounts of evidence. I echo Senator Siewert's comments there: we place on record our thanks for their work and their professionalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Siewert said, it is an exceptionally complex issue and I am not sure that I understand it any better than at the beginning, but we were able to tease out a great deal of information pointing to areas that we as a committee felt needed improvement. They relate to transparency, they relate to accountability and, of course, as the committee found, they relate to affordability and the differences in prices between public and private hospitals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point made by Senator Siewert that we need to bear in mind, with whatever action the government takes in response to this inquiry and its recommendations, is that we must ensure that the Australian manufacturers are not unfairly dealt with because they are smaller entities. They are not of the same size as many of the multinationals. There is a lot of innovation that takes place here in Australia, and I want to make sure that, moving forward, whatever we do in terms of a government response actually looks after those interests and ensures that we keep that innovation onshore, here in Australia. To that end, of course, the response needs to be evidence based. Any way of dealing with the high cost of implantable prostheses needs to be based on strong evidence. We cannot just have a blunt-instrument approach. We need to do it in a way that ensures we are dealing with the problems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the board, though—and I again echo what Senator Siewert said—there was consensus on the report. Everyone wanted to end up at the same spot, and that was to ensure that there is fairness in pricing and that we do not unduly impact on Australian manufacturers. I, too, commend the report to the chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

It has a reputation; nevertheless, it is a very good beach. I know the Great Australian Bight from the work I did on marine protected areas before I came into parliament. It is an absolutely stunning, pristine part of this country that is home to a very productive marine environment, including one of the biggest whale sanctuaries on the planet, where we have very important calving grounds for our southern right whales on their way to the Southern Ocean, where they feed on krill every year, give birth to their calves and then start the journey all over again. </span>

I asked Shell and BHP two weeks ago why they are not exploring the Great Australian Bight. Senator Back, you might be interested. They said that they have had a look at it; it is too high risk and too expensive to develop.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am moving this disallowance not for the Australian Greens but for those many, many patients who have life-threatening illnesses and are undergoing intolerable suffering—patients who have cancers, brain tumours, uncontrolled epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and suffering from debilitating spasms; patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and have intractable nausea and vomiting; patients who are suffering from excruciating chronic pain; and all of those people who need some level of relief for which traditional or conventional medicines are not helping and for which medicinal cannabis has been demonstrated scientifically to provide some significant relief. I am calling on all sides of the chamber to come together now to show these Australians who have been dealt a cruel blow when it comes to their health that this parliament respects them enough to allow them the same rights of access to effective medications as to any other medications. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is budget week. We have heard a lot from both of the major parties about their level of commitment to health and I just hope that they are not hollow words, that what we will see with this disallowance motion is real support for those people who have terminal illnesses and who require the assistance that only medicinal cannabis can provide to them. It should be a no-brainer. Why? All this disallowance does is restore the existing rights of patients who by definition are suffering from a life-threatening condition to access the medicines they need to ease some of their pain smoothly and rapidly. Should someone be suffering from a terminal illness, there is a special scheme that allows them to get medicines into their hands quickly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This disallowance motion makes two simple changes to the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Narcotic Drugs) Regulation 2016 to restore the rights of terminally ill patients to access medicinal cannabis products through category A of the TGA's special access scheme and through personal importation. Let me condense that into English. It means that there is a special category A through the TGA that says that, if you have a life-threatening illness, you can actually go to your doctor and your doctor will make sure you get this drug in your hands to help you. It is a special pathway for people with a terminal illness. It also relates to importation. If you have a terminal illness and you get access to medicinal cannabis while you are travelling overseas, you can actually bring it into Australia. Again, we would think that both of those things are no-brainers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about people who have life-threatening illnesses, as determined by their doctor. They still need to go to a doctor to get this medication in their hands. This is not some pathway that bypasses the medical profession. Indeed, it is through the medical profession that access is made available. The special access scheme of the TGA is designed to provide a pathway for Australians to access treatments that might not be registered here in Australia. If you desperately need to get access to medicinal cannabis and it may not be registered in your state at this time for the condition that you have, you can get that medication through your doctor. Again, I emphasise that it is through a doctor. It allows doctors the freedom to prescribe the most appropriate treatments to their patients even when that treatment is not available in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two tiers of the special access scheme. There is category A and category B, and they have different levels of regulation associated with them, and it depends a bit on the condition of the patient. I want to stress again that the condition of the patient is strictly defined in the special access scheme. If you are eligible under category A, the definition for eligibility is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… persons who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, one would think that is a no-brainer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government stands up and heralds the progress we have made with medicinal cannabis, but they have been dragged there kicking and screaming, it must be said. But we Greens drafted private members' legislation and were assured by the government that if we worked with them, they would provide access to patients. We did that in good faith, so I am hopeful that they will now say that this scheme is available to patients. Why is it that we would have a double standard? Why is it that we would have category A, which is basically a standard that says: if you go to a doctor and there is a drug not available here in Australia and you are suffering from a terminal illness and the drug is not registered in Australia, you can have it as long as it is not medicinal cannabis. If we do not support this disallowance, that is what we are saying. We are seeing to patients: 'You have a terminal illness, but you cannot get access to your drug. We know it is going to help you, and you can bring it here to Australia, but just make sure it is not medicinal cannabis.' You are either serious about this stuff or you are not. You either recognise that medicinal cannabis is evidence-based treatment for a range of conditions and you make it available to people for those conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australians, the special access scheme allows their doctor to prescribe them treatments that they believe will be of benefit to ease their suffering and to do so based on the recognition that time is of the essence. For example, let us talk about some of the stories. Let us talk about Dan Haslam. He was a young man who suffered from a very severe form of cancer. He was 21 years old. He got cancer and underwent chemotherapy. He found he could not tolerate it and spent days afterwards, head down in a bucket, vomiting because of the severe nausea associated with the drugs he was taking. He tried all the conventional drugs that are used to treat nausea. Then someone suggested medicinal cannabis and he got rapid relief with the drug. What should we say to somebody who might be in that position who cannot access the drug? Should they not be able to access medicinal cannabis through the category A scheme? I just simply do not believe anybody would think that was appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think sometimes it is too easy here in this chamber to forget that the decisions we make have a material impact on the lives of everyday people. Let me tell you about Lindsay, an 18-year-old boy from Queensland. He has refractory epilepsy, which means it is epilepsy which just does not respond to many of the different drugs that are given. Some of them make people very drowsy and some have a whole range of other side effects. Along with his epilepsy, he has chronic pain and nausea as result of a brain tumour. Lindsay was the first Australian patient approved for medicinal cannabis in Australia, when it was still schedule 9—that is, when it was not available through a regulated TGA process. He also got a serious benefit from his nausea. He actually got some appetite, and we know that many of the people who have cancer lose their appetite and lose weight, and that contributes to the downward spiral. The medicinal cannabis helped his nausea and appetite and he got some strength back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the applications for him to get the drug have taken months and months. It was 19 months in the first instance to get access to medicinal cannabis, and the supply is patchy. He has periods of poor health and he simply just cannot get access to the drugs he needs. Lindsay and his courageous mother, Lanai, have been fighting for years not just with the tremendously challenging condition of his health and because of his brain tumour but also with our punitive, opaque and unnecessarily overburdened regulatory system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the coalition who says they want to cut red tape. Well, this is red tape they should be prepared to get the chainsaw out for and rip to shreds. This red tape is stopping a medication that relieves suffering getting into the hands those who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to you that you cannot, and should not, in all good faith vote against this disallowance motion, which would make sure that people like Lindsay are able to access the drug when they need it. Or people like Jason, who was 40 when he died last month from his brain tumour. He was diagnosed in 1986; he went through chemotherapy, surgery and radiation treatment. He suffered severe brain damage and was cared for dutifully by his mother, Janell, until his death. He could not complete his chemo because his weight dropped to 20 kilograms—and he was an adult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicinal cannabis gave him relief so that he got his appetite back and could eat a little. It relieved some of his pain and gave him some quality of life in his final years. But Jason died having to access medicinal cannabis illegally, because the pathways to access it were far too onerous and far too difficult. To use the language of the government, there was far too much red tape. His mother said after his death that her only regret was not allowing him to use medicinal cannabis in her home—because, in her words, she was deadset opposed to illicit drugs. Yet she saw the relief these treatments gave her son and said she would defend his use to anyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access through category A meant that people like Jason—and, indeed, people like Lindsay—could go and see their doctor and, if they were not able to get medicinal cannabis through the pathways approved by this government or by state jurisdictions, there is a mechanism for those people suffering from terminal illness to be able to get the drug in their hands when they need it. I cannot understand how any of my fellow senators here in this place would not be moved by these stories and cannot see that their opposition to this simple change would improve the lives of those dying Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand Senator Hinch wants to say a few words, so I will truncate my speech so that he has the opportunity do so. But let me end with the words of one of the advocates of medicinal cannabis, someone called Lanai, an advocate and mother to Lindsay, who asked me to pass on this message to you. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the life of a patient with a life-threatening illness, like my son Lindsay, one day waiting for a medicine is a day too long. Lindsay has been waiting now since the start of this year and he is suffering seizures again. If this was your child, would you want to wait, or would you think that this government can act now and make sure that patients like Lindsay can get the drug when they need it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am calling on all members of this chamber to do the right thing, to stand up for Australian patients and to make sure that today you do something that is good and something that is decent.</span>

This is a complex issue, and neither of the options before us strikes a perfect balance between access for patients who have legitimate clinical need and protection of the broader community. But, on balance, Labor will support this motion to disallow the government's regulation on category A. We are hopeful this will give medical cannabis advocacy groups and clinicians time and space to craft an agreed way forward. In the meantime, terminally ill patients will have access to a therapy that can ease their suffering, and Labor will monitor the rollout of any evidence of abuse of category A.</span>

He mentioned that sometimes in this place we forget the effects we have on everyday people. I saw everyday people with these medical conditions at the MardiGrass at Nimbin last weekend—I saw hundreds of them. Thousands of people were there. I met a man who had done ten months jail last year for getting cannabis oil for a family friend's baby. I met a woman whose child had like 900 or a thousand convulsions and, when they started taking cannabis oil, they stopped spasming. I talked to a man with brain damage who is taking cannabis oil daily. We had a funny moment there because he said he has invested in the company that is now listed in Victoria. They are making moves in Victoria. They are getting some medical cannabis. These people are not criminals. There should be an amnesty on all parents who have been charged with criminal offences for trying to ease their children's suffering and especially for terminally ill people—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I wish to contribute to this debate, having been an active member of this committee. Can I, firstly, place on record the appreciation of all the senators for the effort undertaken by the secretary and her staff in the way this matter has been dealt with. There is a bit of an unusual outcome, Mr President, in the sense that the report to the Senate is a report that deals in six chapters with the actual facts that were presented to the committee in relation to this particular matter. It will be seen, now that it has been tabled, that there have been no recommendations come forward to the Senate as a result of this inquiry. When you scrutinise the outcome of this particular inquiry, you will see that each of, I think, three of four groups of senators have in fact put in additional comments. I speak then on behalf of Senator Reynolds, Senator Gallacher and me. The additional comments conclude with 1.102, in which we say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We support oil and gas exploration in the Great Australian Bight subject to continued strong oversight by NOPSEMA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many, many reasons why we have drawn that conclusion. Can I join with Senator Whish-Wilson and others in making the point of just how vitally important the Great Australian Bight is as one of our marine areas around the Australian coastline. It is the fact that there must be tremendously regulated circumstances in place for any companies that might want to explore or extract product in the Great Australian Bight. But that is no different to other marine areas around Australia. Our own North West Shelf has a highly developed offshore oil and gas industry. Indeed, speaking of whales, because southern right whales have been mentioned by many people in submissions and evidence to the committee, is it a fact that the humpback whale is very active up and down the Western Australian coastline? In fact its numbers have increased significantly over time. It is also a fact that under the management of then Premier Barnett that Camden Sound was declared, what I believe, to be the largest whale sanctuary in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What it proves is that, with excellence, diligence and oversight of a very competent body, such as NOPSEMA, it is possible to meet both sets of objectives, those being to protect the marine environment and to be able to explore, exploit and, hopefully, extract hydrocarbons. Why is it that the Great Australian Bight has been identified as a prospective area? CSIRO many years ago came to the realisation that the Great Australian Bight is an entirely prospective area. It has challenges—it has deep water—but companies these days, as I believe Santos and Murphy Oil indicated to us, are perfectly competent and comfortable with drilling down to some 4,300 metres. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People talk about adverse weather conditions. Those of us who know a little about yachting and boating conditions in the Bass Strait know that they are also very harsh conditions, but we also know that for 40 years there has been extraction of hydrocarbons in the Bass Strait. That particular project has not only provided energy, for the state of Victoria particularly, but generated some 50,000 jobs and contributed some $200 billion to GDP in the Bass Strait alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak of the North West Shelf. Already there is oil and gas extraction by companies like Woodside. Increasingly into the future, it will be Chevron, but we know that Shell and ExxonMobil and others are involved. Off the North West Shelf we have already seen some $60 billion of export revenue, some $70 billion of contribution to GDP and more than $5 billion of return to the federal government by way of taxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it so important that we are looking to these locations for extraction? Australia now imports around 80 per cent of its crude, which is then refined into petroleum products. Beside the fact that that is costing us some $34 billion a year, we will move to the stage relatively soon, probably by about 2026 or 2027, when we do not have any oil here. The only oil we are going to have will be condensate that comes off as an offshoot of the LNG processing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other disturbing fact, as was pointed out to us by the International Energy Agency, is that Australia is now down to less than 45 days of product—in January, I think, we were down to about 39 days. People say, 'Can't we add either the refined or crude product coming in from overseas?' The answer is, no, we cannot. When you look at the two main areas from which we derive crude coming into this country, it is either through the South China Sea or the Strait of Hormuz between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Neither of them are regarded as being safe locations. We know that there is product in the Great Australian Bight. We know that NOPSEMA is an excellent overseer. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted; debate adjourned.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These cards are intended to enable Defence's large, diverse and dispersed workforce, (all 77,649 at current strength) to travel, and to buy the operational goods and services they need to facilitate their primary task of defending our nation and securing our national interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now, by any measure, Defence upholds a unique role on behalf of our nation. They perform a role that we both admire and rely on. And we commend them for the way they perform that role. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But we do expect them to manage the books. And by that, we mean, to manage all the resources they draw on to perform their unique role. Defence is our biggest commonwealth entity. Its current total budget in 2016-17 is $32.337 billion – and is forecast to grow to 2 per cent of GDP by 2020! (Representing a growing investment of $195 billion over ten years, according to the 2016 Defence White Paper)</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now, this committee understands that credit cards can provide a straightforward means to buy the goods and services, to undertake the travel that a large, diverse and mobile workforce such as Defence, needs to do its job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the committee is also aware, that it can be too easy, sometimes, for the 'small stuff' - such as grabbing a taxi, jumping on a plane; paying the gas bills; buying the stationery and the fuel - to be overshadowed by the magnitude of Defence's investment in our defence capabilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee was in clear and consistent agreement, throughout the inquiry, that the money spent by Defence – a sum of $550million (dollars) in 2014-15 alone - on these day to day, operational costs, using cards, is a substantial amount of public monies. And with access to such privileges, also comes responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is firmly of the view that irrespective of the size and scope of the task facing Defence in managing its resources, the principles of good governance, enshrined in this government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013</span> apply equally to Defence's management of credit and other transaction cards as it does to the substantial investments in the weapons platforms, the military facilities and other technology that build our defence capability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is precisely because of Defence's size and scale that Defence should be set the standard of excellence in financial management and accountability across Commonwealth entities (departments).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence gathered by the inquiry pointed to the need for Defence to put in place systems to manage monies consistent with Defence's duties and responsibilities under the standards set by the Public Governance Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There were a number of matters which raised concern. I will not elaborate on all of them here. Primary amongst these included:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1. Reports of noncompliance with Defence policy – with evidence that defence officials used Defence purchase cards to pay for some 119 traffic infringements incurred by defence personnel between 1 July 2012 and 9 November 2015, contrary to defence policy and procedures – to the tune of some $75,138 on the purchase cards!1</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2. Reports of non-compliance with AusTender, with contract values incorrectly reported; payments not reported or incorrectly blocked; and reporting outside the timeframes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. Evidence of a 'seasonality spike' in end-of-year financial payments – where defence officials sought approval to increase card limits for seemingly routine items in order to expend budget allocations at the end of financial year- behaviour which Defence could not explain satisfactorily to the committee and raised questions around the rigour of budget planning and the potential for waste; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">4. There was evidence of irregularities in the way personnel use cards for taxis and car hire: of particular concern to the committee was Defence's inability to explain evidence of high use of specific individual taxis, multiple expensive taxi fares and 'small hours' travel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">5. The most significant concern for the committee however, was evidence of the irregularities arising from Defence personnel's access to cash advances – and the corresponding softness in acquittal processes - on both purchase and travel cards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6. There were two key issues of concern to the inquiry here: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">i. the absence of adequate controls – and particularly the opportunity for independent verification of the integrity of transactions </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ii. and the high interest generated by access to cash advances – a cost paid by the taxpayer, </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">o Underpinning this was the apparent disregard or disinterest of those responsible in Defence for these lapses in controls and unnecessary costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In one example the committee heard, a logistics officer purchased rations – a necessary activity, for a planned and predictable training exercise - at the cost of over $1million ($1.147 million dollars). We don't quibble over that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But we do have concerns when we hear that, in making the decision to use a Defence purchase card to buy these rations rather than raising a purchase order as Defence policy advised, these transactions generated an ADDITIONAL COST to the COMMONWEALTH OF OVER $18,278 in INTEREST CHARGES, which, because of the choice of payment method, were treated as a cash advance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And Defence's Acting Chief Finance Officer defended this during the inquiry's hearing with the explanation that this was simply 'a bad decision' and not fraud – as if that $18,000 in (unnecessary) interest did not matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Defence (even) agreed that had the ANAO audit not identified this irregular transaction, their own monitoring systems would not have picked it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To illustrate the scale of the problem we are talking about, according to the ANAO audit, the cost of advancing cash to Defence personnel for travel (using the Defence Travel Card) during 2014-15 was nearly $900,000 in interest charged to the Department (based on cash withdrawals totalling $50,761,587 in 2014-15 alone)2</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is an extra and unnecessary cost that the taxpayer has to carry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So there are two critical issues here:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee did not find Defence's rationale for cash advances persuasive and believes that the cost to the Commonwealth is unacceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee was not at all persuaded by Defence's argument that the interest generated by cash advances is justified because these cash advances are a condition of members' employment. This practice simply does not reflect best practice in the public and private sectors and should be re-examined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is concerned by the number of examples which showed an official's use of a credit card was not consistent with Defence or Commonwealth policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Too often, irregularities in credit card use suggested either a disregard for, or intention to circumvent, Defence policy. Yet these irregularities did not trigger any 'red flags' in Defence's management systems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Defence must find an appropriate balance between the unique operational parameters of a large, diverse and mobile workforce which requires ready and frequent access to cash, and the responsibility for ensuring those resources are used sensibly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's not all gloom and doom however. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee was encouraged by the steps Defence has taken to investigate and redress outstanding traffic infringements and improve fleet management, including reducing the risk of fuel fraud. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee commends the changes arising from the introduction of the new governance framework for credit card management, a response to the audit's findings. The committee acknowledges, however, that the evidence indicates Defence still has much work to do to strengthen the effectiveness of controls and fully implement the findings of the ANAO audit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that Defence ensures that its governance of credit and other transaction cards also aligns with the move to a stronger performance-oriented culture under the changes instigated through the One Defence business model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ANAO audit did not identify actual occasions of fraud. The audit did, however, find that in the absence of effective controls Defence remains vulnerable to the risk of fraud, especially in a payments environment which is moving increasingly towards the use of virtual cards. Despite evidence of convictions for fraud in military jurisdictions, the committee is of the view that this information is not readily available publicly. Any deterrence value across the Defence community arising from awareness of such convictions may therefore be limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee appreciates that there is a history to the devolution of responsibility placed upon individuals to account for actions. However, the extent of instances where the use of cards indicates either a disregard or ignorance of Defence policy and procedures also raised questions about organisational responsibility: it raises question about the effectiveness of education, training and communication across Defence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is of the view that Defence should be doing more to educate its workforce on its duties and responsibilities to manage relevant monies properly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To this end, the committee made six recommendations to strengthen Defence's systems and controls to effectively manage its credit and other transaction cards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So that this Parliament, and the community, can have confidence that Defence is managing the books sensibly - and can proceed with their primary task of defending our nation and securing our national interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These recommendations encompass:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Ensuring the full implementation of the ANAO audit report's findings – as well as ensuring the joint committee of public accounts and audit takes an interest in Defence's management of credit and other transaction cards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Defence – in collaboration with the department of finance and the ANAO - should re-examine its rationale for access to cash advances on its cards - and the corresponding acquittal processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Defence must ensure adequate controls are in place to effectively manage taxi and car hire for those unable to use the Defence travel card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">To strengthen the deterrence effect when fraud is identified, we recommend that Defence publish reports of convictions or other disciplinary action on the Defence website as well as in service newspapers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">And finally, we recommend that Defence evaluate its training, education and information programs to ensure its personnel fully understand and address the performance standards set by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013</span>.</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  I have already made a few brief comments on this bill, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, and I want to curtail my remarks because I think it is very important that this bill is voted on this afternoon so that we can bring certainty to the native title holders, certainty to land title groups right across Australia, certainty to the Adani proposals for mines in Central Queensland, certainty to the future prospects for jobs for workers and certainty to the Queensland government about the revenue streams that will flow once these issues are dealt with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I took part in the debate as Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which conducted an inquiry into this legislation. I want to thank all of those who made submissions and all of those who appeared before the committee—and there were a lot of them—to give their evidence. We heard from all sides of the argument, and I think everyone had a very fair hearing. I particularly want to thank the secretariat of the committee, who, as always, did a wonderful job in assisting with the organisation of the hearings and the preparation of the final report. And I thank all senators on the committee for their cooperation. The committee was able to make a unanimous recommendation that the bill be passed, subject to some amendments which have been accepted by the government. The Attorney, in consultation with Senator Dodson and others, has refined the amendment we are dealing with today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will digress very slightly to something that was said in a debate on this topic earlier today. Senator McCarthy, unfortunately, misrepresented what I had said in my earlier speech about future amendments to this bill. Everyone acknowledges that there do have to be new amendments, but they are not being dealt with at the moment. This was specifically in relation to the McGlade decision. That was clear to everyone. Sometime in the future, at the Attorney's direction, there will be consultations, there will be draft bills issued and there will be amendments that the government will work with Indigenous spokesmen and stakeholders on to ensure that the new amendments are correct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I make a plea. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Labor Premier of Queensland, I plead with you: please, pick up the phone and ring the four Queensland Labor senators. Ring them now. They are, in case you have forgotten, Premier, Senator Ketter, Senator Moore, Senator Chisholm and Senator Watt. You should have their phone numbers. Please ring them as representatives of Queensland and say that you, along with the federal government, along with Indigenous people and along with the workers in Central and North Queensland who do not have a job, are desperate to get this bill through the parliament. If that needs sitting tomorrow, as the government has proposed, can you please, Premier Palaszczuk, ask the Labor senators from Queensland, who are supposed to be helping Queensland, to give up their long weekend and get their colleagues in the Senate to sit tomorrow, on Friday, so that we can deal with this bill in a full eight hours of debate and get it passed? Everyone agrees it should be passed. I think it is essential that it should be done. Please, Premier Palaszczuk, ring your Queensland Labor senators and ask them to get off their bums, actually do the work and get this bill passed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I am not going to respond to Senator Macdonald's last statement. He keeps making these statements across the chamber and it does not add to the quality of this debate. We have had a number of senators talk about the history of this piece of legislation. We know that the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill before us is an amendment bill. It was introduced by the government in the other place early this year—15 February. That was the first time that this bill appeared in this parliament. It amends the original Native Title Act to resolve the uncertainty that was created by the decision of the full Federal Court in what we have heard many times was McGlade v Native Title Registrar. That decision was handed down on 2 February this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us in this place understand the importance to our community and to our culture of the native title legislation. In fact, some of us remember exactly where we were when the original legislation was passed in 1993. In the community in which I was working at the time, we were waiting to hear what was going to happen after that extraordinarily long debate, which is probably still one of the longest debates in this place. Finally, the parliament in Australia ensured that there was native title legislation in our community. It is a very important piece of groundbreaking native title legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before us, we have an amendment to that and that must have fulsome and true consideration. There should not be, by any sense of urgency, a push in this place to rush things through. Having said that, I think that we are doing the right thing. We are, through the parliament, considering the legislation after the process of it being introduced. It came into the Senate after a bit of a flurry in getting the Senate Selection of Bills Committee to ensure that we had a hearing on the piece of legislation. That was an essential part of the process. The Senate did its job. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee reviewed the legislation and heard from people and organisations that gave up their time. With their professionalism, their knowledge and experience, they came to the Senate to give us their views on the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of contributions in both this debate and in questions earlier today which may have seemed to indicate that at that Senate inquiry there was a unanimous view put forward that every person who came to that inquiry agreed that this amendment bill needed to be passed and to be passed urgently. Well, that is not true. As with most Senate inquiries, in which I have been involved, there was a wide range of opinion brought to the Senate committee. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee brought down its report, reflecting a wide range of views. But, as we have been told in previous contributions, the Labor senators, Senator Dodson and Senator Pratt, actually accepted that, on the basis of the evidence, because of the specifics of the McGlade decision and how they had impacted on native title, there was a need to ensure that there was a response from parliament to stop any uncertainty or confusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as we have heard from other contributions, this was only step 1 of the process. There was a need for further discussion. We have heard how Senator Dodson, Senator McCarthy and Mr Dreyfus were able to be involved in future discussions. Only then did more amendments appear. I understand that the latest amendment that is part of this discussion only appeared in parliament yesterday. So it is not such a straightforward process as some would make us believe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what caused the legislation to be before us, we know that following the bringing down of the Keating legislation, the Native Title Act in 1993, we actually enshrined in legislation the decision of the High Court of Australia in Mabo v Queensland—my state—which upheld that the doctrine of terra nullius did not apply when there were already inhabitants present. Again, the importance to our community of the High Court decision followed by the response to that decision by our parliament must always be kept front of any discussion that we have about amending the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make it clear—and I am actually quoting now from evidence and discussions that were put into the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee: following the Mabo decision, any Indigenous land rights which had not been extinguished by the Crown continued to exist in Australia. Since 1993, the Native Title Act has enabled the continued recognition and protection of Indigenous land rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is Labor's view—and it has been clearly enunciated by previous speakers from among Labour senators—that any changes to the Native Title Act must be properly considered and consulted on with Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities. That is a key component of our commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities—no decision that impacts on their culture, their land rights and, in particular, this process that talks about the whole future of their relationship with land can ever be taken without full and proper consultation. That is something that this parliament should enshrine in the processes they put in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Native Title Act provides a legislative process for native title groups to negotiate with other parties to form voluntary agreements in relation to the use of land and waters, referred to as Indigenous land use agreements—ILUAs, which people use as a shorthand way of defining these agreements. That was defined very clearly for us in the evidence that came to the committee. Currently, under section 24CD of the act, all persons of the native title group must be parties to an area ILUA. If there is a registered native title claimant for the purposes of the act, the native title group consists of that registered native title claimant. A registered native title claimant is defined again in the act under section 253 as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a person or persons whose name or names appear in an entry on the Register of Native Title Claims …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This enables a person or persons to enter into agreements as authorised by the native title group. The McGlade decision found that an area ILUA could not be registered unless all members of the registered native title claimant had signed the area ILUA, including members of the group who may have died. This ruling overturned the decision that had been current and on which a range of decisions had been made—the ruling of QGC Pty Ltd v Bygrave (No. 2) [2010], which found that an area ILUA could be registered if it had been signed by at least one member of the registered native title claimant group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Post McGlade, the only alternative available to a registered native title claimant group is to re-authorise a new applicant and make an application under section 66B of the act to remove any member of the group who refused to sign. Stakeholders have indicated that this process can impose high costs on registered native title claimants and cause delays. There was significant evidence to the committee that this could cause confusion and worry in a community if they had to go through the whole process again of registering and then waiting for the process to go through the courts. The evidence that came to us was that consideration needed to be given to improving the amendments in the legislation that we are debating today in the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The McGlade decision has potentially far-reaching implications for approximately 126 existing registered ILUAs made over the past seven years in reliance on the decision in Bygrave. These decisions had been made, discussed in the communities and then registered on the Register of Native Title Claims. They had been finalised in good faith, and subsequent decisions about rights to the use of land and the opportunities that existed in communities had been made based on that agreement. These ILUAs include agreements concerning very large areas of land across Australia, including ILUAs made with respect to national parks, agricultural ventures and mining ventures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill responds to the McGlade decision by amending the Native Title Act so that any area ILUA which was authorised and registered prior to the McGlade decision will be valid, despite not being signed by all members of the registered native title claimant group. We have been advised by the government that this change to the law will ensure the validity of approximately 126 registered ILUAs that were negotiated in good faith by native title holders with land users on the basis of the law, as it was clearly understood to be. The amendments that we are debating will also enable the registration of area ILUAs that were lodged for registration prior to the McGlade decision, despite not having been signed by all members of the registered native title claimant group. Again, advice from the government is that this will apply to a further eight ILUAs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the information on which discussions during the meetings of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, as well as subsequent discussions in later weeks, were based. It was also the basis on which the Labor senators originally agreed to accept and support this native title amendment bill. But, subsequent to that, another series of amendments have come before the parliament which have been proposed to consider the situation of the Cape York Land Council. These amendments would extend the bill to also validate area ILUAs that could otherwise be rendered invalid if successfully challenged in the Federal Court on the basis that they were not signed by any registered native title claimant. This is another complication and, in terms of the principle, there is still the situation that we need to make quite clear so that people fully understand their rights and fully understand the implications of the decisions that we are making in the parliament. But that information was not available to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee when they met. It was not available to people who were looking at what was going on in the parliament until this week. I think this creates a sense of urgency and it was not effectively discussed and understood before the last period of discussion. Despite that, Labor have listened to the arguments put around the situation with the Cape York Land Council and their particular leases in that area. It is my understanding that we have agreed to approve that process as well. But this reinforces the concerns that have been raised by people in the community about the need for full consultation and understanding of the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that we will never be able to fully please every person who has some ownership in this case. There will be differences of opinion. We see that and we must acknowledge that. But that almost gives greater cause for the processes that are in place, how we are proceeding and the basis on which we are proceeding to be adequately explained and understood. My concern is that, if we do not actually fully commit to that principle and understand the sensitivities, it could impact not just on this case but on cases into the future. So, on the basis of the evidence before us that has come from our consideration of this particular bill today, we believe that there have been cases made for the urgency and the need to ensure that there is no confusion in the community or in the various property and business processes that are taking place through agreements that were made prior to McGlade. We understand the need for that. But at the same time I think we have to make very clear our concerns about any perception that this has been rushed and any perception that people have not had their rights and their culture fully understood, accepted and respected. We need to make a commitment that we understand the concerns that have been raised about consultation and that any future action this parliament takes will respond to those sensitivities and to the understanding that full consultation will take place, because this is unfinished business. We know that there will continue to be further need for changes and amendments to the native title legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, when Labor's current shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, was the Attorney-General he did refer issues to do with native title legislation to the Australian Law Commission to fully consider where we are now with this legislation and the changes that will have to take place into the future. Certainly, that particular law report now needs to be fully considered by government. There must be much further discussion in this place and a clear process put in place for how we will enshrine the consultative process into the future. We need to make sure that there is trust in the way the parliament will respond to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. That was the intent of the 1993 process. It was the intent of the High Court decision that there be a clear understanding of and commitment to the principles of native title legislation—of true ownership of land. In any discussions about native title in the future we absolutely need to ensure that trust is there and that there is an understanding that we will put in place appropriate and agreed consultation processes. If we do not do that, we will be destroying the history and the challenge of native title. If we do not do that, we will not be fulfilling the extraordinary work that was put in place by the Mabo process and the Mabo family, then and now, who continue, in many ways, to be the actual custodians of the native title legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time, Labor are supporting the legislation, but we say that we can do the processes better, and we must do them better. Anyone who has listened to the contribution made by Senator Dodson would understand the way in which we can do this better. I know that Senator McCarthy will be making the same comments in the future as she has made today about what we must do. I think this should be one of the processes that comes out of today's debate: looking at today's legislation and the amendments, which we are supporting, but learning from the process to ensure that this negotiation, this discussion, cannot be rushed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that consultation takes place. We do not need to have cracks across this chamber saying that the process of having full debate in this place is determined by whether senators want to have a long weekend or not. That does no honour to the person who makes those comments, and it certainly does not reflect appropriate discussion in this Senate. No-one owns morality. No-one owns best practice. But we can do better than exchanging barbs in that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we must do in the parliament is look at legislation, listen to the people who have knowledge, experience and ownership and then balance the arguments here, openly debate the process and move forward, bringing people together rather than laying down laws upon them from outside. And if we do that we will continue the message of Mabo. We will continue the message of the Keating legislation from 1993, and we will enshrine true native title in this community together rather than divided.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  It is a pleasure to make a contribution to this important piece of legislation, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, this evening. It is a piece of legislation that has significance for every Australian. By way of history, in 1992 the High Court of Australia handed down a historical decision in the Mabo v Queensland case, recognising that the common law of Australia recognise rights and interests to land held by Indigenous people under their traditional laws and customs. The Mabo and Wik decisions and the subsequent Native Title Act 1993 were salient points in the history of this nation and the changing relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For over 24 years the act has served Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities well, until 2 February this year, when the Federal Court handed down the McGlade v Native Title Registrar decision, which has invalidated land use agreements across the country. It has also seen the $1.3 billion Western Australian South West land use agreement with the Noongar people, which included a benefits package with annual payments of $50 million into a Noongar future fund over 12 years and 320,000 hectares of land handed over to Noongar ownership, shelved. This decision of the Federal Court has created uncertainty throughout the native title sector, especially over the status of Indigenous Land Use Agreements, or ILUAs. It means that ILUAs without the signatures of all registered native title claimant members, including members who are deceased, cannot be registered. Simply, this means that if a single member of the registered native title group withholds their consent or dies before authorising it, the agreement cannot be registered. This also means that the only alternative to the native title claim group is to re-authorise a new applicant and make a new application under section 66B of the act, removing the member or members of the registered group who refused to sign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an unnecessary and unacceptable barrier on the native title system. It is a barrier for native title stakeholders, imposing high costs for claim groups, which often have limited resources, as well as delays for claimants and third parties. It raises considerable uncertainty for all parties doing business on native title land, especially in my home state of Western Australia. Pastoralists, mining companies, oil and gas companies, tourism operators, fishing and pearling businesses, and local government authorities are all left with a high degree of uncertainty over their existing and future native title land use agreements. This is primarily because native title has a greater impact on Western Australia than on any other Australian jurisdiction. Western Australia is exposed to the responsibilities of native title more than any other territory or state in the Commonwealth. Approximately 85 per cent of the state of Western Australia is subject to either a native title claim or has already received a Federal Court of Australia native title determination that recognises the existence of native title rights and interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sheer size of these determinations accounts for over 50 per cent of the total national land area. There are 79 currently filed native title claims in Western Australia, on top of 60 native title determinations. This compares with just 277 outstanding claims and 316 determinations nationally. Western Australia also grants the highest number of land and mineral licences and titles in Australia, the majority of which must comply with the future acts regime of the Native Title Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those unaware, a future act is an act done after 1 January 1994 which affects native title. A future act can be any proposed activity or development on land or waters that has the potential to affect native title by extinguishing it or by creating interests that are inconsistent with the existence or exercise of native title. Other than the issue of the goods and services tax, the most significant state federal financial issue facing Western Australia is native title determinations, especially future acts. This is a $1 billion plus issue for the future of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is because, in my home state of Western Australia, the most common future acts are the proposed grants of mining or land titles by the Department of Mines and Petroleum and the Department of Lands. It is because in Western Australia all native title claims are determined in the Federal Court, with the WA state government as first respondent. The preferred outcome for all native title claims is that they be resolved through mediation rather than litigation, utilising ILUAs, voluntary agreements primarily about access, which are registered and held by the National Native Title Tribunal and bind all persons who hold native title to the agreement, whether they are parties or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of ILUAs in the native title system cannot be understated. An ILUA may address issues of access, compensation, extinguishment and coexistence. An ILUA may be made separately from the formal native title process, form a part of that process or pave the way for a native title determination. An ILUA does not extinguish native title but may, by agreement, allow for the surrender of native title. Most importantly, an ILUA can address past and intermediate acts as well as future acts. It may also replace the future act process entirely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Federal Court's decision of 2 February this year has far-reaching implications for the approximately 150 existing Indigenous land use agreements that have been made under the Native Title Act, most of them made in the past seven years. In addition to the implications for agreements made with the Noongar people in WA's southwest, it also has far-reaching implications for future land agreements that are currently under negotiation, not just in Western Australia but across every state and territory. Correcting this level of uncertainty has motivated the government to respond quickly and offer a remedy to ensure that all of these agreements have the status that is expected by those registered native title groups and communities that have entered into them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a legislative response that will secure existing agreements which have been registered on or before 2 February this year but do not comply with the Federal Court's decision on McGlade. They will clarify who must be a party to an area ILUA in the future, unless the claim group determines otherwise. These are important changes. Most importantly, they do not alter the intent of the Native Title Act. They give certainty in the Commonwealth legislation to the agreements that have already been struck. They give certainty not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also to all parties who have entered into the agreements, so that they can plan the way forward as agreed and honour those commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The source of native title rights and interests is the traditional laws and customs of the native title holders. This means that the nature of native title rights and interests varies from community to community. This is also why native title can coexist with other forms of land title such as pastoral leases but is extinguished by others such as freehold. However, there are fundamental differences between land rights and native title. Land rights are rights created by the Australian state or territory governments. Land rights usually comprise a grant or a freehold or perpetual lease title given to Indigenous Australians. By contrast, native title arises as a result of the recognition, under Australian common law, of pre-existing Indigenous rights and interests according to traditional laws and customs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extraordinary that, even for a moment, the Labor Party and the Greens would have objected to passing this bill. It is extraordinary but perhaps not unexpected, and I will tell you why. For all their talk about working to make the native title system better, fairer and more transparent, the Labor Party continue to fall short. It was a Labor Attorney-General who removed funding for native title respondents, a move that significantly impacted on native title determinations at the time, not just in WA but also in Queensland and in New South Wales. It was a Labor Prime Minister who, in 2001, advised the WA state government that it would no longer honour the 1994 agreement made by then Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating, the architect of the original Native Title Act, and that the Commonwealth would bear the lion's share of the burden for compensating for native title by funding up to 75 per cent of the compensation costs arising from the validation of past acts on determined native title lands. It is the Labor Party who today, again, is playing games with the passage of a bill that will protect the validity of ILUAs and the integrity of the native title process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is yet another example of how the government is addressing, not ignoring, the deficiencies of our native title regime. As a senator for Western Australia, I support the bill and look forward to playing my part in working with colleagues to ensure that our native title framework operates in a manner that is fair and provides certainty to all parties across all states and territories.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, which is also known as the bill to ram through the Adani coalmine against the wishes of the local Wangan and Jagalingou people. It is known as the bill to give certainty to big miners whilst subjugating the rights of our First Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I go to the process. As we know, this bill was rushed through the House of Representatives about five seconds after the court case found that many of these ILUAs are invalid because not all of the native title claimants and registered claimants have ticked off on them. That was an eminently sensible decision by one of our courts. Of course, this government does not like the fact that that casts some doubt on the ability of the big miners to ride roughshod over not just our land but the rights of Indigenous people whose land it was and still is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have concerns about the time frame and the fact that this was rushed through not only the House but then a very hasty Senate committee process. As the record will show, we Greens sought to extend out the report date for inquiry but, sadly, we were not supported by the Senate to do that. The upshot of that was that submitters did not have enough time to prepare their submissions and we only had one hearing. Everyone would accept that native title as a body of law is incredibly complicated. It is also an issue where it is incredibly important that we get it right. We have a legacy in this country of abominable decisions when it comes to recognising and respecting our First Australians. This native title bill is regularly criticised for being a poor construct which ill fits with the rights that still exist and should be legally recognised as still existing. So to be rushing through a bodgied up amendment at the last minute to an already complex area of law is bad practice, but to do that to favour a big mining company to open up one of the biggest coalmines in the world to further trash the climate and the Reef is utterly unforgivable. Those are our concerns with the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot of opinion about this bill. Clearly, Aboriginal people do not speak with one voice and, clearly, we should not seek to speak for them, which is another matter I will go into. But the other issue we have is that there has not been enough consultation on the effect of these proposed changes. I have personally met with traditional owners particularly from that Wangan and Jagalingou group who are deeply opposed to ramming through these changes to our native title laws. Adrian Burragubba and his niece Murrawah Johnson have been campaigning for reforms to the native title system, as have many other traditional owners in Queensland I have had occasion to meet with. They have been campaigning for their rights to be properly respected. Instead, there has been a litany of frankly dodgy practice around the signing of this ILUA. I have had lengthy briefings with Adrian where he has explained to me how the mining company has bussed up people who are not even from the local area to stack the meetings.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATERS:</span>
                    </a>  So they have been bussing in people who do not genuinely represent the Wangan and Jagalingou mob. As a result, an ILUA has been signed that does not reflect the wishes of that mob. Is it any wonder that the government wants to preference the needs and wishes of a big mining company ahead of reaching a genuine consensus and a genuine free, prior and informed consent arrangement with our First Australians?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our laws do not enshrine the requirement for free, prior and informed consent. Internationally we have that obligation, but there have been no steps whatsoever taken to put that into our domestic laws. This is a real blight that we should be attending to fix as a matter of urgency, but, no, that would of course make it more difficult for the big mining companies. So you will not see that out of this government, and you probably will not see it out of the opposition either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pretty clear that this bill is a sop to Adani, and the relevant minister admitted as much earlier today. He really belled the cat in that Adani have leant on the government, they have leant on the state government and they have demanded certainty—the audacity of them demanding certainty when this is and always will be Indigenous land—and now the government is saying, 'Oh, you want us to jump? How far would you like us to jump?' and are ramming through these laws. We saw the Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, head off to India in the last few weeks and do a deal with the head of the Adani Group and assure him that it would all be settled, that it would be fine and that she would sort it out. They have rolled out the red carpet for this company. It is a shame that they have done no such thing when it comes to the First Australians in Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, hot on the heels of the Queensland Premier was none other than the Prime Minister himself, who also went over to India in a big sop to Adani and its company group. He also said, 'We'll sort it out; don't you worry about that, mate. We will trash the native title rights and we will fix this for you so that you can build one of the largest coalmines in the world on Indigenous land. We don't care if the local mob don't support it. We've got some signatures on a bit of paper from the wrong people, but we don't care; we will use the law to abuse the process and make sure that your donations keep flowing to us and that you can rip out the guts from our land.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really clear that the impacts of this mine would completely trash the significance and specialty of that land, both for non-Indigenous people and also, importantly, for the Wangan and Yagalingu people. They are deeply concerned about the impacts on groundwater and the impacts on their dreaming sites. They have taken me powerfully through some of the dreaming stories of that land, and it is moving and something that should be respected. Instead, this government is saying that it wants to simply roll out the red carpet even more for a big mining company and it does not give a damn about the rights of the Wangan and Yagalingu people, who are desperate to have their voices heard in the native title process and to have their rights respected. But, as we have seen, the native title process itself has been a construct that, from the word go, was a compromise to suit the white fella. And now we have some amendments which will make it even more convenient for the mining companies and even less of a genuine system to recognise the prior existing rights of Indigenous people. It is an absolute abomination, in my view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving to the impacts of this bill: if this is passed—and we will fight it—it will retrospectively validate those ILUAs which a court has found to be dodgy, to be not properly signed, because not enough of the relevant traditional owners signed on to them to make them valid ILUAs. So the government want to retrospectively validate an agreement to facilitate a big mining company. Often they come in here and try to say that they are doyens of the law and that they do not like retrospectivity. There is a principle against retrospectivity in lawmaking, because it changes things after the fact. You are not meant to do it—in plain language—but this government do not care, because, again, Adani has said, 'Jump' and the government have said, 'How high?' So they want to retrospectively validate these dodgy ILUAs and subjugate the rights of the Wangan and Yagalingu people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This mine is probably the best example of the worst and most appalling way that the big parties are working for the interests of big mining companies, and the big corporates generally, ahead of the interests of ordinary people. It is no surprise and it is no wonder that Australians think that our system is broken and that our economic system is rigged against everyday people. This is the same system that lets the greedy bankers rip off everyday people with the full protection of politicians—although we note with pleasure that the banking levy, a partial adoption of Greens policy, has been proposed in the budget. This is the same system that would let Adani take unlimited groundwater from our state, which is 90 per cent in drought. Nobody else gets free water, but this mega-multinational mining company is going to get free groundwater in a state that is 90 per cent in drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same system that wants to give a billion dollars of public money to that very same company, as a concessional loan. It will cost the budget—and we have sought to establish that in estimates—tens of millions of dollars to give this concessional loan to a company led by a billionaire, who should not need the support. Adani has got a complex corporate web of companies. If it cannot even organise itself to fund its own project, why is the taxpayer being asked to put up their hand and provide public money for this project?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that point, I want to pick Labor up for trying to walk both sides of the fence. They keep saying that if this project stacks up then it should get NAIF funding. Well, the whole point of the NAIF funding is that it can only fund projects that do not stack up commercially. So I am afraid that Labor's rhetoric is utterly inconsistent when it comes to its pathetically divided approach on this enormous mega-mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One wonders why the big mining companies, and Adani in particular, have such influence over both sides of politics and both levels of government, and one needs to look no further than the political donations that are made by the fossil fuel companies to both sides of politics. At last count it was $3.7 million over three years that the fossil fuel sector—that is, big coal and big gas—have given to the Liberals, to the Labor Party and to the National Party. That is $3.7 million to run their election campaigns, as they desperately try to cling to power. And then they buckle on implementing their principles once they get into power, but that is beside the point. These donations are incredibly generous, and it is very clear that they are having the impact of policies that are designed to benefit the big corporates and to sacrifice the environment and to ignore the interests of ordinary community members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is why there is the powerful movement that has sprung up in opposition to this mine. It is a David and Goliath battle. You have got the big miners and the big corporates generally. You have got their big donations. You have got the well-connected lobbyists—the former politicians who now work for those very same mining companies, or their former staffers. Again, it is a revolving door when it comes to the fossil fuel sector; one minute they are in this place making decisions; the next, they are promised a cushy job and they are out working for the industry, and back and forth it goes. I have spoken at length in this chamber about that previously—about the absolutely sordid links between the fossil fuel sector and the parliament, and the fact that it is no wonder that we get poor decisions out of this place when they are so impossibly hocked to the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So one would think that this is a David and Goliath battle that people-power might not win. But people-power will win this because ordinary Australians do not want to see Indigenous rights trashed. They do not want to see our Reef further cooked by turbocharging climate change, like this mega-mine would do. They do not want to see a billion dollars of taxpayers' money given to a multinational company that does not need the help—and when that money could be so desperately better spent in other areas, and when they have not even had a chance to have a say on how that money should be spent. Many people in the community whom I speak to in Queensland are horrified when they hear that this project might get a billion dollars of public money, because, they say, 'I was never asked whether that was what my community wanted. We want better schools. We want better hospitals. We want some renewable energy jobs. We do not want a billion dollars being given to this dog of a project that will not employ anywhere near as many people as they claim it will.' And the company has admitted that—it acknowledges that it is not going to be 10,000 jobs. It might be 1,464, but who knows? We will have to wait and see. Of course, they are all FIFO jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have seen the impact of the mining boom-and-bust cycle. Look at Gladstone. That poor town is now thoroughly destitute after the boom. I remember going to Gladstone five years ago; you could not get a hotel room. And now, of course, there are an awful lot of empty properties, because that is what happens when you get a mining boom-and-bust cycle. It puts communities through the washing machine, and they end up worse off because rates of violence, and domestic violence in particular, skyrocket; the cost of living skyrockets; and then the miners up and leave town, and the community is left with nothing. They have just ridden roughshod over that community, and I do not want that to happen to other communities in Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen in Queensland the resurgence of black lung, which coalminers are now suffering. We thought that that disease, pneumoconiosis, as it is known, was stamped out decades ago. But it is back. So these are not the sorts of jobs that you would want anyone to be working in, because people are now dying from them. Why this government and the state government thinks that the only possible job that can be created in regional Queensland is a coal job just shows an absolute lack of imagination and an absolute lack of understanding that we are now in this century. We have other options. Clean energy can do the job technologically and, if we hurry up then we will not get further behind the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it comes back to those donations. It must be that is why the big mining companies have so much sway over both sides of politics, and it is why that is all the jobs they can think of—jobs that are short term, that will not last, that are subject to that boom and bust cycle, that are killing its workers and, importantly, that are threatening the reef itself and the 70,000 jobs that rely on the reef remaining healthy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to the reef many a time, and it made a huge impact on me. It is an absolutely magnificent place. If anyone has not had the joy of experiencing it, I would encourage them to do so. But it is under threat. We have already seen it being slammed with the two worst coral-bleaching episodes in its ancient history, the worst ever in the last two years, two successive years. Never before has the reef suffered such bleaching and never before has it happened in back-to-back years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scientists are being crystal clear about this. They could not be clearer. Terry Hughes and others of his ilk have been pleading and begging with decision makers at all levels of government saying: 'We cannot have more coal in the system. It is a choice between new coal or the reef. The reef can't take it anymore.' It has been falling on deaf ears in this place. Indeed, when my colleague, Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, asked a question in the last sitting which pointed to Terry Hughes' desperate despair at the future of this reef that he loves, and so many other people love, he was ridiculed and mocked and offered a hanky. Come on, this is the federal parliament of Australia. Surely we can do better than that. We are talking about the future of an organism that can be seen from space, that will outlive and outlast all of us unless this mob continues to trash it by handing free money to big mining companies to line their own pockets with profits and then trash the climate for the rest of us and for future generations to look after. That is why this bill is so important. It is not only about Indigenous rights and the future of where we want to take the economy; it is also about what we want to do to this planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have mentioned before that the red carpet has been rolled out for this company, and I want to go through precisely what state Labor have done. They have given a water licence with unlimited and free groundwater for the Adani Carmichael coalmine. They have offered Adani a royalty holiday. So not only do this company have the privilege of a billion dollars of public money that they will probably be awarded under this government; they are not even going to have to pay for the privilege. And here is the catch: the Queensland government is not even telling us the details of this royalty holiday. They will not say how long it is going to be for and they will not admit how much money Queenslanders will forego because the government is giving this company a free ride. What an absolute joke!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have also created a special loophole for Adani so that there are no appeals available to the community against the water licence. Again, nobody else gets that sort of special treatment. Nobody else says: 'The processes don't apply to you. You can have this free pass. We'll make sure the community can't exercise the rights that they would otherwise have. She'll be right, mate.' Queensland Labor and, of course, this government here at the federal level as well, have approved the mine at every stage and at every level. Queensland Labor have now actively lobbied for federal funding for this project after they went to our state election saying they would save the reef, and people desperately wanted them to; they wanted to believe that. They said they would not put a cent of public money into the project and it had to stand on its own two feet. They had also earlier said, through their own Treasury officials, that this was an unbankable project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so what a surprise when, now that they are in government, they are actively lobbying for that federal money, that taxpayer money, to be given to this project! Interestingly, they have a veto power—it is not really being spoken about much. The Queensland government can veto the $1 billion that NAF might approve and probably will approve and give to Adani—and we would be urging them to do so, to stand firm on what were clear election commitments that they made, that the community supported because the community loves the reef and wants to see it protected and not trashed for the sake of a few extra dollars in a billionaire's back pocket.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pretty clear the processes are being rigged with vested interests. I have talked about the enormous amounts of donations, and that is probably why they are greasing the palms of the process that is happening here. But I want to also remind federal Labor that they are not without power here. If Mr Bill Shorten—who, frankly, has been trying to walk two sides of the road on this one—simply picked a side and said today or tomorrow that he would review the environmental approvals for the Adani coalmine because of the information that has come to light since those approvals were handed out, because of the litany of examples of environmental destruction in various different countries across the world, then that would create enough pressure, I believe, for the company to abandon this project. They know they have got a terrible track record of environmental destruction. They have been taken to court in their home country at least once and have been convicted of destroying mangroves and misoperating a port. What is the reaction here in Australia? Queensland Labor puts them in charge of a port, gives them a 99-year lease and says, 'She'll be right.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wangan and Jagalingou people are standing strong against this mine, and they are standing strong against having their rights complete subjugated by this bill, which would retrospectively validate an ILUA that does not reflect their wishes. We are standing with them. We are standing with the 70,000 people who want the reef protected and who want their jobs protected, and we are standing for positive job creation for regional Queensland that will last and will not trash the reef.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>): I rise to speak about an uncomfortable truth, because that is what the whole process leading into this debate has been about—and continues to be about—in relation to native title. It is an uncomfortable truth disguised as legislation. It is an uncomfortable truth disguised in urgent amendments. It is an uncomfortable truth that is tucked away behind legal speak—heard but not understood. Even here, in the house of the people, this truth remains uncomfortable. Why? Because it is the symbolic and deeper truth about our country—the unfinished, unspoken business of black and white Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty-five years ago Eddie Mabo said no. He did not want to remain part of an uncomfortable truth tucked away, hidden. He did not want to be reassured with numbing advice that his legal options were impossible. He did not believe that his truth of being a strong Meriam man of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait, nor his people's richness in historical past and resilience in the present, should be silent. But many around him did. They wanted to stay complicit in the silence. It was comfortable and easier than change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This house of the people also stayed silent, as did most Australians, but the conscience of the great spirits of this beautiful land we all call home moved in the heart of one man and in the lives of his fellow plaintiffs, Reverend David Passi, Celuia Mapoo Salee, Sam Passi and James Rice. Like any family, there was, no doubt, division in Eddie Mabo's family and in his clan groups in the islands—bitter divisions, not least of which centred on the authority to make decisions about everyday life on Murray Island, about who could hunt where for the food that was needed to feed families or whose role it was to take the lead in ceremonies sacred to their people. It is human nature to have conflict. It takes a spiritual nature to pursue peace through such conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was friction in the understanding of legal doctrine and further separation of whose legal advice was the better to follow. Who could interpret the law in such a way as to dare challenge the centuries old law, the doctrine of terra nullius? Eddie Mabo did. His challenge and win in the High Court resulted in the Native Title Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward 25 years and the Noongar challenge in the Federal Court sees the Senate here today debating amendments in relation to the McGlade decision. While an important victory for some Noongar families—and I commend those families—it has created uncertainty for others. In fact there is uncertainty in the future of more than 100 Indigenous land use agreements, ILUAs, that we know of. I seek leave to table the 126 ILUAs that the federal government has failed to provide information to the Senate on.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McCARTHY:</span>
                    </a>  The job of the Senate is to scrutinise the possible impacts of that decision in this amended piece of legislation. A one-day Senate inquiry hearing, over a few weeks, is not a long time for examination, despite the best experienced people on that inquiry—I know my colleague Senator Pat Dodson has advocated strongly and passionately, within this fraught process, for the rights of native title holders. It is most regrettable that further time was not given to allow even conversations with the parties involved in the over 100 Indigenous land use agreements to see if they understand the ramifications of the McGlade decision and even this amendment before the Senate. I might add that, in the full routine of what this process has been so far, I have just received notice of another amendment, or the removal of an amendment, which just goes to show that this government has no idea and can give no confidence to this Senate or to the Australian people, and certainly not to the first nations people, that it has their best interests at heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many questions that remain unanswered, such as: how many ILUAs were registered prior to the Bygrave decision of 2010 which might be affected by the McGlade decision; what steps have been taken to identify and audit these agreements; how long would it take to identify and audit these agreements; and are there any other native title agreements—including the right-to-negotiate agreements concluded under section 31 of the Native Title Act and ILUAs registered prior to the Bygrave decision—that might be impacted by McGlade? Cape York Land Council is the only one that I am aware of that has done an audit of its agreements, and that is only because Senator Pat Dodson forced the government to meet with native title holders; otherwise, we would not have even known about Cape York's issue. And that is just one land council amongst a dozen land councils across this country and certainly hundreds, if not thousands, of native title applicants and custodians across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It begs the question: have other Aboriginal land councils and native title representative bodies done audits? Can they confidently say there are no issues? Can the Attorney-General say with any confidence that we will not be here in the future with further amendments required as a consequence of these changes not being properly scrutinised or thoroughly consulted about with traditional owners right across the country? While the government has stated time and time again that this is not about Adani but about certainty for parties to native title agreements, Labor has supported the amendments on that basis—that they will bring certainty for native title groups, government and industry. However, there is more than a suggestion that this is not just about certainty for native title agreements. In the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation, former coalition MP Ian Macfarlane, who is now the CEO of the Queensland Resources Council, advised the committee that there may be another category of native title agreement. The CEO of the Queensland Resources Council advised the committee that there may be another category of native title agreement affected by McGlade which is not rectified by this amending legislation. These are agreements negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are enormously significant agreements, underpinning some of the largest resource projects in Australia. If what Mr Macfarlane advised the committee is correct, then there may be potentially hundreds of other native title agreements, and hence major resource projects, in doubt due to McGlade. The Attorney-General is aware of this issue. Indeed, Mr Macfarlane said he had spoken with him about that matter. But, despite the lack of certainty about these agreements, the government has not seen fit to address them in this amending legislation. They have been totally ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask then: what about the certainty for the native title groups who are parties to those agreements negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act? What about the certainty, for that matter, for industry and government with respect to these projects? I find it curious that the government views it as urgent that ILUAs be given certainty but that some of the biggest resource projects in Australia, negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act, should not. And I wonder: in the two months since the Senate committee, why hasn't the government done the work to identify all classes of agreements affected by McGlade, including both ILUAs and the right-to-negotiate agreements?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These contradictions lead me to doubt whether this is really about certainty for all native title groups and parties. If these amendments truly were about certainty for all parties to native title agreements, surely the government would have seen fit to amend it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 30 June last year, the Federal Court of Australia handed down a judgement in a case of incredible significance for my Yanyuwa family in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Justice Mansfield, in one of his last judgements, found that exclusive native title still existed in Borroloola and was held by the Rrumburriya people, of which I am a member. He also found that, for the first time in the Northern Territory, the Rrumburriya people have, among their bundle of native title rights, the right to trade for commercial purposes. Now, although we have never described it in this way, the right to trade is something that we Yanyuwa people have always known forms part of our long cultural tradition. We have traded with other neighbouring clans and the Macassan visitors from Indonesia for many generations. But, although we have known this, it has taken this long to have it recognised by an Australian court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it was a moment of great celebration for my families, this success comes with a number of caveats. The native title system is uniquely difficult to understand and navigate, let me tell you. Native title claimants must endure endless meetings and interrogations in order to prove that they still have traditional laws and customs. Court processes requiring the filing of service of legal documents are completely alien to many Indigenous people, and sometimes the lawyers themselves have difficulty communicating the complex legal concepts underpinning the Native Title Act. One of the parts of this at times impenetrable native title system concerns the authorisation and execution process for Indigenous land use agreements, the processes of which are the subject of this current bill. Adding to this complexity is the fact that the system, which adjudicates on the very identity of Indigenous people and our legal rights, has its central power in institutions that are located far away, in the Commonwealth parliament in Canberra and in the highest courts in the land. Thus, there is no doubt in my mind that the native title system, despite all it can bring, can also cause alienation for the Indigenous people who it is said to assist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the complexity of the native title system that Aboriginal people are forced to navigate, the profound impact on Aboriginal people's legal identities and rights of this system, and the remote location of the institutions that can affect these legal identities and rights, it is a matter of great sadness to me that these amendments have always been rushed and always come at the last minute. Of all the laws in Australia, the Native Title Act is meant to go some way to remedying the past dispossession suffered by Indigenous people. On this basis, it should never, ever be amended in haste. Amendments should always be thoroughly debated and consulted about, particularly with the Indigenous people who will be the most affected. The government, and in particular Senator Brandis, has failed to give native title legislation and, by extension, native title holders proper consideration and respect in this shabby process. The behaviour of the government has been shameful, secretive, cynical and arrogant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been little recognition of the significant and long-term impacts these amendments will have on native title holders and the rights they fought so hard to have recognised. This government failed to consult properly with native title holders until they were dragged by Senator Pat Dodson to do so. The government were very selective in whom they decided to talk to and they have been even more selective in whom they decided to listen to in this mess of a process, which was created by them in their haste to force through flawed policy as a matter of political expediency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, traditional owners are your constituents. How many of you have asked them about this amendment? If I asked the traditional owners in the Northern Territory or even closer to home—if I ask the Yanyuwa traditional owners—who are also Native Title claimants, 'What does this legislation amendment mean to you?' they would probably say, 'I don't know. I need more information,' or, in Yanyuwa language, ngarna kudardi—'I don't know.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate might like to think it is up to the native title rep bodies or even the land councils. The government did not think that. But it is up to the senators to reach out to their Indigenous constituents. With over 100 Indigenous land use agreements across the country and 76 senators who represent this country, how many of you have even asked if any of the native title applicants in one of those ILUAs are in your constituency? How many of you have asked whether your constituents might need to know what is being debated in the Senate today? Do they agree? Do they understand why? Do you? If not, then how can we in the Senate, the house of the people, speak with confidence that this unexamined approach to amending the Native Title Act will end uncertainty? It is an act that requires at least a symbolic sacredness and respect because of the deeper truth that enabled its birth from the first nations people of Australia and our system of laws and beliefs, to attempt to build a future with the Westminster system of laws and beliefs.</span>

To all those impacted by the McGlade decision, on all sides: may you find some comfort in knowing that this parliament acknowledges the strength of your struggles; keep believing in the impossible. Eddie Mabo did. I acknowledge his wife, Bonita, and daughter Gail Mabo, especially as we come close to the 25th anniversary of the High Court decision. Thank you for your guidance to me on this journey here today. I will keep believing that one day the uncomfortable truth will be a respected truth.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  I rise this afternoon to add my comments to this debate on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. Firstly, to contribute to the comments made previously by Senator Siewert and Senator Waters, it is a disgrace how the government has handled this piece of legislation in this place. It is an absolute exploitation of the fundamental issue of land rights in this country, again, with Indigenous people simply being used and abused when it suits the government. We all know why there was a suspension of standing orders earlier today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate to try to bring on this bill and ram it through this house tonight. That, of course, is because the government are more interested in the rights of mining companies than they are in the rights of Indigenous people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are fundamental issues with the bill. We know we need to consider it in proper detail. Instead, all the government gives a damn about is giving a free pass to the mega coal company Adani. It is not even an Australian company. It is a dodgy, corrupt company based in India that is already under excessive investigation for corruption, money laundering, tax evasion—the list goes on. Why on earth are we seeing our parliament hijacked by a dodgy company like this, via the government of the day, just so that the company can get their project up off the ground? And let us not forget it is with the help of $1 billion of Australian taxpayers' money, offered up at mates rates by the Turnbull government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely appalling to see our parliament hijacked by such a corrupt, dodgy coal company. It proves just how much this government really is in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. What on earth is Senator Canavan getting out of his continual advocacy in this place for the Adani project?</span>

                    </a>  Mr Acting Deputy President, I will withdraw the comment. I still ask: what is the arrangement for the special mates rates deal that the government is giving this foreign company to not just exploit the land on which they want to run their project but put the entire challenge of our dealing with climate change at risk? One of the biggest problems with this project is that Australia will never be able to reach its weak targets, if the proposed amount of coal is dug out of the ground and burnt. If this project were to go ahead, we might as well say goodbye to climate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why on earth does this company need a billion-dollar leg-up from the Australian taxpayer, if it is a good project anyway? It is because no-one else will bankroll them. The executives at Adani are desperate to get the final approvals done by the federal government. Of course, the Queensland state Labor government have done their bit to help this company every step of the way, and now we have, rushing through this parliament, the desperation of this company. Every time the minister stands up he says nothing about Australians; it is all about the big overseas company Adani. It is as if he is more the minister for Adani than he is the minister for Queenslanders or, indeed, Australians at large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to question what on earth is really going on, because this government and particular ministers are so obsessed in relation to this project and with helping out this dodgy, corrupt company, who are going to burn our planet to a crisp if they are able to get this amount of coal out of the ground. We know that the coalition and, in particular, the National Party are absolutely in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. They do not give two hoots about tackling climate change. They do not really give a damn about the limited amount of jobs that this company is going to create. We know that it is not as many as they claim, because in court they were found to have been lying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not what they are obsessed about, because it does not make any sense. It is, of course, that this government and members of the government are absolutely in the pocket of the big fossil fuel corporations. These big fossil fuel companies, whether it be Adani, BP or Chevron, think they run this place. They think that they have every right to get bills voted on when they want to get their projects ticked off in their time frame—and they are happy to take the government handouts and leg-ups whenever they can as well. Tax rorts, handouts, cheap loans, mates rates—it goes on and on. The fossil fuel companies, those big multinational corporations, love to think they run this place. When are we going to start talking about the people's rights and land rights, not mining rights? When are we going to have that conversation in this place?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am at it, when we talk about those in the pocket of Adani, those doing everything they can to hand out a billion-dollar mates rates loan to this big company at the expense of funding schools or medical facilities in Queensland, you have to wonder what is going on inside the Labor Party as well. They are talking out of both sides of their mouth on this issue, and they absolutely know it. You have the Queensland government selling out their own people, and you have the federal Labor Party not knowing what to do. They are absolutely split on this issue. When is the Labor Party going to start standing up for proper action on climate change and staring down these climate criminals in these multinational companies? When are they going to have the guts to do that? Even just earlier today, we saw the Labor Party in this place not being able to sign off on a decent report about the risk of BP drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight. We had a South Australian senator from the Labor Party cross the floor and sign off on a report with the Liberals to protect the interests of Chevron. You might wonder why on earth the Labor Party would get themselves into such a mess that you have one senator saying that Chevron and BP should have the right to drill for oil and the others—</span>

                    </a>  How interesting that people in this place are so tetchy about what really goes on behind the scenes. But it is not behind the scenes, because we have a South Australian Labor senator signing on to the report with two Liberal senators to say that it is A-OK to drill for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight—cuddling up to the fossil fuel industry all over again. Isn't it interesting that Chevron, the big multinational company that wants to drill for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight, donated money to the South Australian Labor Party within days of the hearing into that particular issue by the Senate committee? Isn't that interesting! People listening to this debate could obviously draw their own conclusions about why that particular South Australian senator had to sign on to a report that supported Chevron being able to drill for oil, but I think it is appalling. I think it is absolutely sickening to see the level of influence and corruption from the fossil fuel industry in this country creeping into every nook and cranny of how this Senate operates, from dictating when we debate bills, what time we will debate bills, to now dictating who will sign on to reports or not. This fossil fuel industry cannot continue to dominate what goes on in here.</span>

It is extraordinary that, at a time when we should be cleaning up politics in this country, we see the government bending over backwards to help Adani, and we see the Labor Party incapable of getting their act together to stare down the crooks in the fossil fuel industry—the climate criminals who are going to fry this planet.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I thought I might talk about the bill before us! Labor has a long history with native title in this country. It was Labor, under Whitlam, who returned traditional lands in the Northern Territory to the Gurindji people, with the Prime Minister famously pouring sand into Vincent Lingiari's hands. It was Labor, under Keating, that introduced the Native Title Act in the wake of the historic Mabo ruling. And I do not say this to boast; I do not think any Australian could argue that as a nation our relationships with our first peoples have been without shortcomings or without error. I say it because Labor have a deep and enduring relationship with native title. It is something that we care about, it is something that we take seriously, it is something that we wish to protect, and it is this history and this perspective on the significance of native title and its seriousness as an issue that have guided every decision we have sought to take in relation to the bill before us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The integrity of the native title system is the only consideration that has been front of mind for the participants in negotiations around this bill, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. This is the reason we are providing support to this bill. The recent McGlade decision by the Federal Court does have the potential to throw the entire future of our native title system into uncertainty. This is a real problem, and it needs to be solved. It is disappointing that this is not the approach that has been taken by others in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens political party do not have a policy position on this bill; they have a political strategy. They have been trying to tie these native title changes to Adani ever since the challenges related to the McGlade case first presented. Senator Siewert, back in February this year, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The news that Attorney General Brandis will hurriedly push through changes to the Native Title Act smacks of knee jerk reaction to a significant situation because they want to protect the Adani coal mine project …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been numerous comments from the member for Melbourne all this week. All this week, we have heard about it in this chamber. Senator Waters said on Tuesday:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No means no, yet this government is completely deaf to them, such that we now have a bill to ram through a reduction in native title rights just so the Adani mine can get up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Siewert did it again today, during the debate on suspending standing orders. These statements are highly irresponsible. In characterising the Labor Party's position as being associated with Adani, the Greens political party have been highly irresponsible and entirely incorrect. This bill is not about Adani, and Labor's approach is not about Adani. Our approach has been about addressing a real problem that has presented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The McGlade decision found that an Indigenous land use agreement for a particular area could not be registered unless all members of the registered native title claimant group were parties to the agreement. Whilst people may wish to deny this, this throws up huge logistical problems. If left unanswered, it means that more than 100 Indigenous land use agreements could be invalid. These are agreements that were negotiated in good faith by native title holders with land users on the basis of the law as it was then understood. They concern very large areas of land across Australia, including national parks, agricultural ventures and mining ventures. I had the very good fortune to attend the signing of an ILUA, probably about a decade ago, in relation to a national park in New South Wales and to see how very, very significant it was to the three women who had been fighting for that agreement to come into force for more than a decade. These agreements provide long-term benefits to communities and they fund services that are important to those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, this bill responds to the uncertainty in that decision. It amends the Native Title Act so that any Indigenous land use agreement which was authorised and registered prior to the decision will be valid, even if it was not signed by all members of the claimant group. Labor is supporting changes to the legislation only to the extent that they will restore the law to the status quo, as it was before the McGlade decision.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:00</span>):  We acknowledge that we meet on Aboriginal land, that this land was never ceded, that we have unfinished business and that we, the Australian Greens, are committed to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to address this. On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, a time when Australians came together to say that they would no longer tolerate Indigenous Australians being treated like second-class citizens in their own country, there is next to nothing in this budget to close the gap with the first peoples of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The indifference to this great injustice in our national story is just one of the many failures of this budget. And there is no greater failure than this budget's silence on the greatest challenge facing us not just as Australians but as a species on this beautiful, fragile, little blue planet of ours. It is simply remarkable that a budget delivered in 2017 does not even mention the words 'climate change', not once, at a time when the Great Barrier Reef is undergoing a second coral bleaching within 12 months and the summer Arctic ice could disappear within a generation. Indeed, how telling that while the budget references the cost of Cyclone Debbie, it fails to mention that we will see more cyclones and more extreme weather.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are Torres Strait Islander peoples who are right now threatened by rising sea levels and storm surges, desperately trying to build walls to protect their beautiful island homes from seawater inundation. This week I met with the mayor of Torres Strait shire who told me about how his community needs funds to finance mitigation work, but of course this government is deaf to his pleas. The science is clear, the need for action is urgent and yet there is nothing in this budget to address the existential threat of a rapidly warming planet. And, unless we deal with that, unless we deal with that existential threat, everything else is background noise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inaction on climate is a stunning betrayal of all of us, but it is especially a betrayal to the generations that follow in our footsteps. It will be the next generation of young leaders who have to clean up the mess that our government is making. It will be the farmers of the future who suffer the consequences of damaged land and increasingly frequent extreme weather events. It will be the next generation of engineers who inherit a decrepit and polluting energy system. And it will be the next generation of medical and nursing students who will have to deal with the climate impacts on their health of the rapid spread of infectious diseases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But climate is just one way that this budget screws over young people. It is now crystal clear that this government has no plan for their future. The politicians who benefited from higher education have decided that the single biggest cut in spending in this budget should be against university students at $3.7 billion. Many of the same politicians, who were lucky enough to buy properties when housing was affordable, have decided they would rather continue to enrich themselves and their mates with tax breaks for their property investments instead of abolishing negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, which is critical if we are going to make inroads on making housing more affordable for young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stinking reality is that change will not happen while this government—and, indeed, the Labor Party—remain hopelessly handcuffed to the mining lobbies, property developers and their rich mates, who funnel millions of dollars into their campaigns. Over the past five years, for example, mining companies have donated $1.3 million to the Labor Party and $5 million to the Liberal and National parties. I have said it before and I will say it again: this is state-sanctioned bribery. These entities are not donating out of the goodness of their hearts. It is a commercial decision to buy influence, and this budget proves that it is working. You have to wonder for a moment if it is a coincidence that just a few months ago the big four banks all agreed that they would no longer make political donations to either of the major parties, and it is the one area where the government finally chooses to act in the public interest and take them on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the good news for the vast majority of Australians who believe in a more decent and more caring society is that the government has finally, reluctantly, been dragged, kicking and screaming, to accept that we do have a revenue problem. After persisting with the 2014 budget—flogging that dead horse and it is cruel and heartless cuts—they have seen the writing on the wall. The government has had no choice but to accept that its individualist, dog-eat-dog, neoliberal ideology is a dead end. Trickle-down economics has failed. The public has had a gutful. They understand that we are not just economic actors, selfish individuals always in violent competition. They know that we are members of a cooperative species who like to work together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community understands that taxes are the force that allows us to pool our resources and create a better society for everyone. Both here and around the world, people will no longer stand by and allow governments to continue flogging off public assets. They are sick of governments acting in the interests of corporations and not of the community. And so it was that the Treasurer walked through the looking glass and has begun to talk proudly about investing money in the public ownership of the Snowy Hydro and other infrastructure. It is a welcome change, but there is also a little bit of Stockholm syndrome in the response to this budget. The nation has been held hostage by this Liberal government's brutal ideology for so long that, when the chains are finally off, we are lulled into thinking that they have our best interests at heart. No-one is fooled. The public know that this is a political decision: carefully calibrated, carefully calculated and borne out of political survival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been described as a Labor-lite budget, but let me tell you that it could never be a Greens-lite budget. It is a budget that utterly fails our environment. There is more public money to open up gas fracking across our cherished farmlands than there is for anything that will help us make a rapid transition to take advantage of the rich resources that we have for renewable energy and a pollution-free future. There is bugger-all for the climate. Indeed, the only money for our natural world is what the Greens secured for Landcare, Indigenous Protected Areas and the Indigenous Rangers program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Still, those of us on the progressive side of politics should take heart from the fact that we are winning the battle of ideas. It dawned on me just yesterday when I was listening to a government minister, one of a long line of alumni of the Institute of Public Affairs. There he was, going head-to-head with me, spruiking the benefits of the bank levy. I have to say, it must have really stuck in his craw. I could see that he was doing it really tough. The Greens have been banging on about the bank levy since well before the global financial crisis. The behaviour of the big four banks and the response from government represents some of the most egregious failure of free-market, neoliberal, crony capitalism that we have ever seen. You see, the big banks make huge profits. They gouge their customers and worse, yet they have got their hand out, relying on a taxpayer guarantee if they ever get into financial trouble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'too big to fail' response after the global financial crisis represents everything that is wrong with our broken system. When times are good, the big end of town creams it; when times are bad it is up to taxpayers to foot the bill. That is why we support the move for a bank levy. It is something we have long pushed for and was knocked back by Labor and Liberal governments for years. People around this place told us we were dreaming, yet here we are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talked a lot about fairness in its budget, but simply saying 'fairness' does not make it so, just like talking about protecting Medicare does not keep it safe. Look at what the Prime Minister was doing only a week ago, standing on a warship with President Trump, congratulating him on dismantling public health in the US. People are not going to be fooled by the Medicare guarantee fund. It is a glorified bank account. It does nothing to improve our health system or to protect Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, rather than taking responsibility for their failures, they have chosen the well-worn path of the Right. They blame easy targets. They look at foreigners and people doing it tough and blame them. This is a budget that uses racist dog whistles to encourage resentment and scapegoating—look no further than the changes to 457 visas, the foreign investment tax and the new citizenship test. Meanwhile, the Australian government continues to torture innocent refugees and people seeking asylum in offshore detention camps, at a cost of $573,000 per person each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the predictable attacks on people who receive income support. Treasury has forecast unemployment to remain at above five per cent over the next four years. What that means really simply is that there are more people than jobs. But, rather than acknowledge that, we have this disgraceful, shameful, discriminatory proposal for mandatory drug testing. As somebody who has worked as a drug and alcohol clinician, let me give the government a few tips. By the time someone is addicted to an illicit drug they have often lost their job. Their marriage has often broken-down. They have got no contact with their family and they might even have contracted a disease like hepatitis C. They might be living out of their car or on the streets. If all of that is not enough to stop someone from using drugs, what fool thinks that taking away income support is going to succeed? All they are going to do is be driven further into despair and find other ways to get their money to buy drugs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just about people being addicted to drugs. If we open this gateway to government applying a morality test for government support, what is next? We are setting a very dangerous precedent. Imagine failing a drug test because you take a pill at a festival or smoke a joint and losing your HECS funding as a result? Imagine losing access to Medicare or the pension? It is a dangerous move by the government, and there is no way it will pass the Senate on our watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, health reform is back in the waiting room for another two years. We are not going to see any action on chronic disease, and there is nothing to tackle three of the looming health challenges facing Australians: obesity, heart disease and diabetes. While we push people on income support further to the margins by ostracising and demonising them, we are being asked to celebrate the end of the freeze to doctor's payments under Medicare. The Medicare freeze might be over, but the Newstart allowance has been frozen at levels below the poverty line since 1991.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, the opposition mouthed platitudes and made a big fuss about corporate tax avoidance, yet it is hard to believe that they are serious about corporate tax avoidance and about taking on the multinationals when they are taking their massive donations. Tonight, Bill Shorten called on the government to make the deficit levy permanent. Yet when the Greens sought to amend the act back in 2014 to make it permanent, guess what Labor did? They voted it down. When the Liberals sought to give top-end earners a $315 tax cut last year, it was Labor who joined with the government and One Nation to back it to the hilt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, we Greens in the Senate are the genuine alternative. We are working with the community to knock off many of the worst aspects of the last three budgets. In this budget there is: mandatory drug testing; higher education cuts; ineffective approaches to housing affordability; ripping $300 million from the aid budget to give to ASIO—I look forward to ASIO building wells and engaging in polio eradication right across the world—and spending more on war and weapons. Those things have not been done yet, and we will be working hard in the Senate to stop them. You can look to my colleagues across the chamber and know that we will do everything we can to make sure that these proposals do not see the light of day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">An incident having occurred in the gallery</span>—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are different choices that this government could be making. If we built one less submarine, we could fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. If we built three less submarines, then we could have a world-class public education system. Our job is not just to deal with the dangers of the present; it is to champion new ideas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, we finally see the notion of good debt being introduced, separating out recurrent and capital spending to utilise low interest rates to build productivity-enhancing infrastructure, such as national rail projects. These are Greens ideas. It is just a shame the government did not fund them properly. The list goes on: the levy on the banks, as I mentioned; aggregating bonds from public housing to be managed by community housing providers; overhauling financial dispute resolution schemes; portability of bank accounts; and measures to stop multinational tax avoidance. These were all first pushed by the Greens, and now we are seeing those ideas being adopted. Indeed, we see Labor adopt negative gearing and capital gains tax discount reforms, despite initially opposing them. We see their support for a royal commission into banks and financial services, despite voting down our proposal when we introduced it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the Greens who are generating new ideas and who are at the vanguard in this parliament. The fact that our ideas are moving into the very centre of public debate has a much longer history than this budget. The Greens were ridiculed when Bob Brown first talked of marriage equality and when we laid out our vision for a clean, green, 100 per cent renewable energy future. It was Christine Milne who began the charge against multinational tax avoidance, well before it was fashionable, with the Senate inquiry that has led to some of this budget's new measures. We were the party that proposed reform of superannuation as a priority for budget savings, put forward as a way to end its operation as a tax haven. No-one was prepared to touch it. Now we know—again, big change. Of course, my colleague and co-deputy Senator Ludlam has been advocating for veterans exposed to nuclear radiation to be covered by the gold pass since well before I was even in this place. Well done, Scott—this budget finally ushers in this change.</span>

                  </a>  So what is next? We need a Buffett rule so that very wealthy individuals have to pay tax on their income instead of employing fancy accountants and lawyers to work it so they pay nothing. We are sick and tired of hearing about millionaires who pay not a cent in tax. There is nothing fair about that. A Buffett tax will address the growing inequality in Australia, and I urge Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten to join the Greens in adopting it. I understand the opposition leader today mouthed the words, 'Let's back it up with action.' We are prepared to work with you to introduce meaningful reform. Let us introduce a Buffett tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to get rid of inefficient stamp duty and replace it with a broad based land tax that drops the price of a house by $50,000 in Sydney or Melbourne, and encourages and enables people who want to downsize. The Greens have outlined a pathway forward where the Commonwealth can help the states switch from the worst tax in the country to the most efficient one. I would just say to the Treasurer: it is on our website—right next to the bank levy! Have a look at it!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to end the tax-free fuel for mining companies. It is among the biggest expenditure items of government. It will grow 16 per cent from $6 billion this year to $7.4 billion annually. Surely, given that the rest of the world has recognised that fossil fuels have got no future, this has to be the last budget where we see this needless subsidy. I suppose it depends on whether the mining lobby continues to give generously to both sides of politics. But you know what? I have got a sneaking suspicion that it will not be long before we win this one, too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us redirect the private health insurance rebate and put more money back into our public hospitals—into public health care. It is worth over $20 billion every four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People want to see their representatives thinking about the future and about our country's place in the world, but what this government has done with this budget does nothing to assure people that these massive issues—issues perched on the horizon, ready to arrive—are being thought about, let alone prepared for. The government has been dragged kicking and screaming to the present, mugged by political reality. But, while they are looking over their shoulder, the world around them is changing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians do not want a government that is nostalgic for the past. They want a government that has plans for the future. They want a future-focused budget, which is why we are making a commitment to give young people the opportunities in life they deserve, no less than did the generations before them. It is why we will fight those university cuts and ensure that underfunded public schools get the help they need. It is why we will bring in a renewable energy transition authority to tackle climate change and support Australia's rapid transition to a 100 per cent clean, modern, renewable energy system.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future of work is precarious. Whether we like it or not, a massive reorganisation of work is underway.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="2O4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HINCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  I have one word to sum up the Turnbull government's 2017-18 budget, and that word is 'pragmatic'. This is a budget that is aimed at this chamber—aimed at the Senate, especially the crossbench. They have finally buried the 2014 Abbott-Hockey horror budget, and their so-called zombie bills—although cynics know that zombies have a habit of rising again from the grave, like the horror movie. We should have seen this coming when financial minister Cormann repeatedly said: 'Park, park,' to controversial segments when negotiating passage of the recent omnibus bill. It is more proof that, in this 45th Parliament, Senator Cormann and Prime Minister Turnbull are real pragmatists. And that is good. It is not the Abbott-Credlin 'my way or the highway'—that approach to the crossbenchers. This is not wasting-your-time, ideological, play-to-your-base material. These are bills that seem genuine, practical and, in the case of Gonski mark II, fair and justifiable. I have heard so many commentators, including the Greens leader and Labor MPs, describing this at times as a Labor budget or a Labor-lite budget. So I guess I should now presume that the opposition will be voting for all of it. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="2O4" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HINCH:</span>
                  </a>  I will deal with some of the other issues in a minute. I mentioned Gonski, so I will get education out of the way first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have admitted on radio and television in the past—before I jumped the shark—that I am personally opposed to taxpayers funding any private schools, Catholic or otherwise. My belief in the separation of church and state extends to many areas. The taxpayer should not be funding proselytising school chaplains either. But that is another issue. I sent my stepson to a private school, Wesley College, and he got a great education. I went to a state school, primary and secondary, and I thought I got a good one, too. But these are personal views, not party views. Anyway, I will concede: taking funding away from private schools is never going to happen, so it is not worth wasting any time debating it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not the only reason I had reservation about Gonski mark I. The money for Labor's Gonski was never there. That is why I thought it was ludicrous for them to be bleating about Gonski II slashing $22 billion. You cannot cut money that was never there. So I will support the reborn Gonski. I will withhold judgement on the university issues until I am better briefed, but, instinctively, I think the new $42,000 kick-in for the repayment of HECS debts seems savagely low, especially in this day and age when rents, electricity and other living expenses are so high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, I am more interested in a claim by Senator Birmingham which has not received much mainstream media. He was quoted the other day as saying that the government was writing off—or, even worse, had written off—more than $50 billion in HECS debts. I am told tonight by the government that the write-off figure was closer to $12 billion. But even $12 billion smackers! My God, wouldn't Sco-Mo love to get his hands on some of that. I have not been able to find out yet why this is so—as Julius Sumner Miller would put it. All I have been told so far is some lame rubbish about, 'Oh, some people moved overseas to live.' Twelve billion bucks worth?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are on the subject of money, as I said on TV last night the bigger story about the banks in budget week was not the surprise imposition of a supertax but the leak which saw $14 billion ripped off major bank shares by short sellers in the know. I have written to the Federal Police, asking them to investigate what looks to me like a serious criminal case of insider trading. At first, I thought there must have been a leak from the lock-up. But I have since discovered there was a rumour sniffed by Sky News on Monday night and the short sellers hit the exchange Tuesday morning. The banks had been raided for $14 billion by 10.30 am—three hours before the lock-up even started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my letter to AFP Commissioner Colvin, this is a classic criminal case of insider trading. It could be the biggest case of insider trading in Australian history. It makes Steve Vizard's insider trading sound like Monopoly money. I contacted the feds because they can easily find out who sold short on Tuesday. I asked them also to see if those sellers or their families had any connection with Capital Hill. Did it involve a federal employee or employees, a ministerial staff or staffers, or even a politician or a politician's staff?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am now, disturbingly, getting unconfirmed reports that some banks were briefed some time ago about the modelling of a levy, but, to be fair, there was no hint that it would actually be in the budget. Then, a wink is as good as a nod, as they say. Worse still, I am hearing today that some stockbrokers heard of it from their investors early Tuesday morning, instructing them to dump the major banks' stocks. ASIC is now getting involved, too, so this issue still has long legs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was some good news for pensioners in this budget. There was good news for 92,000 pensioners in getting their concession cards restored and, especially, for pensioners wanting to downsize their homes but who have been scared of being penalised. I have been pushing this pension protection idea here in Canberra and on 3AW with Neil Mitchell. Now, I know that under the new budget—we all know—that homeowners who downsize will be permitted to each put $300,000 into their super funds and maintain their pension status. I am told that could free up 50,000 family sized homes for younger homebuyers or families wanting to trade up to bigger houses. That and other things, like salary sacrificing, will not solve the housing crisis, but it is something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big ticks too for the $350 million for Defence returned servicemen. That includes, of course, $130 million for survivors of the British nuclear tests at places like Maralinga. On that, you have too ask: what took them so long? Whenever returned servicemen are mentioned these days, I cannot get one awful statistic out of my mind: more than 30 of them have committed suicide this year. The last one I heard about was on Anzac Day. On the surface, I applaud the $33 million earmarked for the establishment of a Commonwealth redress scheme for survivors of institutionalised sex abuse, as documented in heartbreaking fashion at the royal commission, but I will suspend judgement on this one because I am already, sadly, seeing signs that the government is going soft on early royal commission recommendations, like the proposed maximum payment of $200,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another fund that deserves a mention: the new Skilling Australians Fund. Over four years, $1.5 billion will be allocated for apprentices and trainees, and the government claims that could support 300,000 young people training to enter the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One embarrassing thing for the government was the scant mention of two controversial words: negative gearing. It is true: people with negatively geared property will no longer be allowed to claim an annual trip to inspect the property as a tax deduction, and depreciation on the washing machine I think has also been disallowed. I support negative gearing. I have declared in my pecuniary interest register that I have one heavily mortgaged negatively geared apartment, but I am open to legislation to limit the number of properties, residential or commercial, that a person can negatively gear. I am increasingly being convinced of a limit of two or three such properties. It could help first-time buyers who are being swamped by investors, local and foreign, at every weekend auction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also on the issue of house prices, we should be pressuring state governments to scrap stamp duty. That, along with things like payroll tax, was meant to go when the Howard government brought in the GST. Stamp duty is a savage tax. As I have said before, you do not even get a bloody stamp! Still on housing—and permit me to be parochial for a minute—in the budget, and I have to applaud this, the government announced that it will release 127 hectares of Defence department land in Victoria which will accommodate 6,000 new houses, and that is great. Some would say that the fact that it is in Bill Shorten's electorate is even better. Still being parochial, the $500 million for Victoria's regional passenger rail is very good news, as is the $100 million for the Geelong Line upgrade. The Melbourne-Brisbane Inland Rail project was a boomer, mainly for freight, but I wonder: what does that mean for the much vaunted Melbourne-Brisbane bullet train? I am probably dreaming to think that the $30 million from the federal government to help build a city-to-Tullamarine rail line will convince the Andrews government to embrace the project. In my view, it is a scandal that a major metropolis, the world's most livable city, does not have a city-to-airport rail link.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the budget, I tweeted a good-news link. It was about living organ donors and recipients—an issue close to my heart, literally. It was confirmed on Tuesday night. It is a plan I have been pushing for more than three years. It involves payment to living organ donors, especially for kidneys. Sometimes a compatible mother or father cannot donate a kidney to a family member because, in these tight times, neither of them can afford the three or four months off work to recuperate, so the government is now providing $4.1 million for donors' out-of-pocket expenses. It is not enough, but it is a good start. When I first raised this issue a few years ago, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sunday Telegraph</span> in Sydney accused me of organ trading or organ selling. Yeah, right! But this is a good excuse to segue to my plea for a million more Australians to join the organ and tissue donor register and to remind people of my campaign for the government to legislate and create a living will so that, if you are on the organ donor register, your wish to be an organ donor will be honoured. I call it 'opt in plus'. Right now, there are more than six million Australians either registered or intending to give the gift of life, but what many people do not know is that more than 40 per cent of people registered as donors will not have their wish granted because, in their grief, their families, their loved ones, will overrule their wishes, and I believe that is wrong. I understand what grief can do, but it is your body and if in life you want to be an organ donor then that wish should be honoured and protected in death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Still briefly on health and the Medicare levy increase: the NDIS is one of the most important health and welfare advancements in Australian history. The Medicare levy will guarantee that the NDIS will be fully funded in the decades ahead. Disabled Australians and their carers need this not tomorrow but yesterday, and now it will be done. From me—and I hope from all Australians—it gets a big tick of approval.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I hope it is not an omen or a sign that the 2017-18 Turnbull government budget is about to go arse-up that the printed copies of Treasurer Morrison's speech on Tuesday night that were distributed to senators and members in the other place and dignitaries had inside the cover the speech upside down. I know it is a topsy-turvy world that we live in, but that is ridiculous. I will leave you with a final word about the budget: pragmatic.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="G0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:36</span>):  This budget overturns the many commitments of the Liberal Party that they have held for many generations, it tramples Costello era fiscal responsibility, it taxes Howard's battlers, it leaves the Minchin mantra on finance friendless and, to true conservatives and loyal Liberals, it is a disappointing budget. Australians, particularly the millions of conservative Australians, want better from their government. They want governments to be principled, to be transparent and to be honest. The only transparent and honest thing about this budget lies in its naked ambition to help the government to hang onto office. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is a political fix. It takes all of Labor's attack points and embraces the Labor agenda. It has left Labor and its leader, Mr Shorten, so bereft of lines of attack that they have had to dust off the old records—class warfare and beating up on the wealthy. These things work a charm every time, particularly in trades hall, or so they tell themselves. Labor have essentially been blindsided because they thought the Liberals would never tell their conservative base to go jump, but the Liberals, unfortunately, have told the conservatives to go jump, and they are jumping over here to the crossbench. I believe this budget will see the crossbench grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said before that this budget is not honest. Australian voters are realising, to their horror, that the Liberal government they elected, which they thought were not Labor, are very close to Labor too. This should be Labor's triumphant moment, quite frankly—their attack of the clones, if I can put it like that; the moment where everyone flips and you discover they are all a version of Labor. It is 50 shades of Labor in this place. There is the realisation that the Nick Xenophon Team does Labor better than Labor does, that the Greens are just a more extreme version of Labor and that the Liberals are now Labor light.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everywhere the voter looks we have got 50 shades of Labor—well, almost everywhere, because there are pockets of us. There are millions of conservatives around Australia who are looking for a better alternative and, as a representative of Australian Conservatives, I am determined to provide a better way for them because they are demanding a better way. They are seeking a credible alternative to vote for because the government has disappointed them again and again. Conservatives do not like being told to go away. They do not like being told by pollsters that they do not matter. They know there is a better way, because politics is failing to deliver for the people in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us remember that the government got to this side of the chamber in 2013 by fighting Labor's big new tax—the carbon tax. It is a government that rolled up its sleeve and in its very first few weeks managed to get rid of the carbon tax and the mining tax. This government now, because of this budget, can be accused of getting here under false pretences because it is now implementing big new taxes of its own. In fact, there are three of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first big new tax is the insurance tax. We were told when the carbon tax was repealed that it would mean every household would be $550 a year better off, and yet Minister Porter told us on budget night that the insurance tax that his department has introduced will alone cost $400 per year per taxpayer. It is fair to say the savings from axing the carbon tax are now gone. The carbon tax is effectively back, only this time it is bigger. It has been on steroids. Copying the Labor playbook of virtue taxation, it is not now a tax that is supposed to save the planet; it is a tax that is supposed to save the NDIS funding mess that Labor left us with. It is a virtue double whammy, if you will. But this time it is from a Liberal government. I consider it quite callous, quite calculating and very political that this government is appealing to people's patriotism and their sense of moral obligation by pegging this insidious new insurance tax to the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I predict today that the NDIS will never, ever be fully funded. The NDIS will be exploited. It will be rorted. In fact, it is already being rorted, and no amount of money will stop those rorts. There has to be a better way. But I find it ironic that a government that got in after getting rid of an opposition leader over his support for the then big new Labor tax is now led by the same leader bringing in an even bigger new insurance tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, that is not all. There is not one or two but three big new taxes. The second one, of course, is the bank tax. We were told on budget night that it was a levy, but it is not a levy. Former Prime Minister Mr Howard belled the cat on that. He just told the newspapers that it is a bank tax. This is coming from a Liberal government, now a 50-shades-of-Labor government, that ignores two maxims, two essential truths. The reality is that the more you tax, the less your economy is going to grow and, just as sure as night follows day, business taxes flow through to consumers. The bank tax will flow through to consumers. In fact, many investors, particularly self-funded retirees and those with money invested in superannuation, have already paid once and they will pay more with the bank tax because, before Labor, the Greens and, I am sure, the Xenophon team clear this big bank tax through the Senate so that taxpayers can pay for it a second time, we have already seen $14 billion wiped off the value of the banks due to this additional taxation burden. That is $14 billion worth of investors' money that has gone up in smoke or with the stroke of a budget pen. And that is before the banks even pass it on to consumers in the form of higher fees or higher interest charges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a third big new tax in this budget. I call it the worker tax. Just like the carbon tax was designed to cash in on public hysteria about the climate, the worker tax is designed to cash in on the public outrage about foreign workers. It is straight from the Labor playbook—another 50 shades of Labor in this parliament. In this place and in the other place we have 226 members, but there are only the Conservatives and what are essentially the 50 shades of Labor. As the sole true-blue representative of Australian Conservatives, it is hard to see past the red because the new worker tax will, like other taxes, flow through to consumers. Businesses that cannot fill skills gaps, gaps they cannot wait years to get Australians trained up for, will have to raise their costs to meet the worker tax. These costs will be borne by consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the worker tax is funding another big government agenda: a training fund. It is, again, a virtue taxation styled at skilling Australians. It is going to be rorted. Nothing is surer because every program that has been introduced in this space has been rorted. What is amazing is that a Liberal government is setting up a training fund so that the government—not a market, a business or an associated entity—can decide the best way to fill skills gaps. It is going to be left to the government now. We know that in the past the government's schemes have not produced the results that are required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in combination, the insurance tax, the bank tax and the worker tax, will raise the tax take by an extraordinary 7.8 per cent next year. That is 7.8 per cent that will not be in the productive economy. By 2020-21, the federal government will suck in an additional $60 billion a year more in taxes than they do today. Yet, in that same year, debt is expected to be higher than it is today, peaking at around $600 billion. That is what the government will tell you, because that is what they put the debt ceiling to. In reality, the budget papers say that in 2025 the debt is expected to be $725 billion. That means that the debt ceiling they established only two days ago is going to be smashed. So these three big taxes are not designed to pay down debt; they are designed to grow the size, the scope, the reach and the power of government. It is the antithesis of what the Liberal Party used to stand for. It is the antithesis of what the Australian Conservatives do stand for. We know there is a better way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government told us repeatedly that this was an honest budget. It has not taken long—no less than 48 hours—for it to be made clear that this is not an honest budget; it is a dishonest budget. It says that the Liberal Party and the executives within it have adopted another characteristic of the Labor Party, and that is the deployment of newspeak. It is Orwellian. Honesty is now actually dishonesty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the last election the Prime Minister talked up innovation. Remember that? It was one thing that he ran through the whole campaign—'We're going to innovate our economy to great things.' I did not think by 'innovation', the Prime Minister meant innovative accounting techniques—account techniques that he had previously derided and smashed as being wrong and not prudent. Yet they have been adopted in this budget by this government. The innovation started when they started to talk about good debt and bad debt. As I put in a tweet during the week, I worked out what good debt was: good debt was the debt you can hide off the balance sheet and you do not have to disclose in your budget. It makes your bottom line look better but it is still debt; it still needs to be repaid. It is hidden from the headline figures, but you cannot hide it from the overall figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That debt, the overall debt of $725 billion in 2025—if you can believe that figure—is going to have to be repaid at some point. The fact that they will not admit this publicly demonstrates to me that new innovation is a tricky Labor style vehicle designed to shield things from the Australian people. In effect, they are stuffing debt under the equity mattress. It is the tactic that the coalition could legitimately criticise the Labor Party for until now. It was a methodology that Labor minted with NBN Co: you start a government venture that will never be profitable—that does not stack up; that you can cook up on a coaster flying in a private joke; something that you can only sell at a loss once it is built—but you can justify it by sticking it off your balance sheet. It is just like the second Sydney airport: the market does not want to build it because the rate of return is not there. It is just like the inland rail project that the government is choosing to build despite someone else in the commercial sector wanting to build it for billions of dollars less. The Western Sydney Airport and the inland rail project equity vehicles now mean that Labor's NBN model is a practice owned by the coalition too. It is yet more of the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it gets worse. Today I asked the Minister for Finance during question time about these equity projects. I asked what the minimum rate of return is for these projects to justify them as equity projects. I was told it was the inflation rate as set by the ABS. But the funny thing about this inflation rate is that it is currently around one per cent. In the forward estimates it is scheduled to get to 2½ per cent, and the government is borrowing money on the 10-year bond rate at around 2.6 per cent. So, even on the government's current estimates, and assuming they borrowed all the money today when interest rates are lower than they are likely to be in four years time, according to their own estimates, they still do not pay for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government does not have a good track record of building things on budget and on time. So there is every reason to believe that these projects are underfunded and will result in a loss for the taxpayer. That is one of the things I asked the Minister for Finance about today, about the need possibly to be writing off billions of dollars from the NBN Co because it will be an unprofitable government venture when they come to sell it. He did not accept that. He suggested that that was not right. But I can tell you now that telecommunications analyst Bevan Slattery said that $30 billion might need to be written off. Similar calls have existed within the industry, and I have spoken to many analysts about it. I want to read a quote from the then Minister for Communications and now Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, in December 2014. In talking about the NBN and the possibility that they might be losing money on it, he said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">These funds will be recovered one way or another, regardless of which party is in office. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">something like $20 billion or $30 billion, I am suggesting—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">will be recovered from taxpayers by the Government simply writing off much of its investment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Prime Minister said when he was Minister for Communications, but it has been rejected today by the Minister for Finance, because they are using the same tricky vehicles that the Labor Party used to hide their profligate spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another dishonesty in this budget is its attempts to lay blame at the feet of the Senate. I have immense respect for the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and he is right to say that the coalition could not get the zombie savings measures, as they are termed, through the Senate or a previous incarnation of the Senate. I understand perfectly why the government decided to abandon the zombie measures. Why persist with something you cannot get through? But it does not mean you give up presenting some serious alternatives for savings. And yet that seems to be what the government have done. There have been debates in this place to put other savings measures forward, but we have not seen them pursued with vigour by the government. Instead, they have decided that it is easier to tax and spend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call the measures the government have introduced vampire measures. They are no longer zombie measures; they are vampire measures. They will suck money out of the productive economy. They will take money from business and from every household taxpayer. They will burden them with new taxes, new impediments and new costs, which will flow through to consumers. That is going to diminish our economic growth, not strengthen it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fair to say that many on the crossbench, I am not one of them, do like tax-and-spend budgeting. They see the government as a solution to many things. Despite the length of Senate terms—which I believe were designed to allow us to take a long-term view and avoid short-term thinking, and also to act as some sort of hedge against short-term banking—quite frankly, many in this place want the short-term sugar hit of gouging a bit of extra cash out of the government for their focus group or their constituent group. They do not give a hoot about the cost and the long-term consequences, as long as they can kick the can down the road for future generations and for future governments to deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were many sensible, saleable alternate savings measures which the government could have adopted. The National Commission of Audit in 2014 professed a host of measures that in combination would have delivered annual savings of $60 billion or $70 billion per year in a decade or so's time. They are annual savings, as I said—savings that would also in many cases have restructured the Federation and ended the blame game, so that those levels of government that spent the money would also raise the money and be accountable for the money. It would not have resulted in a decrease in spending on good health outcomes. It would not have resulted in a decrease in spending on good education outcomes. It would have resulted in ending the wasteful and often duplicated spending in the power struggle, creating bureaucracies to battle over health and education and infrastructure, and almost every other field between state and territory responsibility where federal governments have no business intruding. As the father of the Federation, Sir Samuel Griffith, famously said, the Commonwealth exists to do those things the states cannot do themselves. How far we seem to have travelled from those wise words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One sensible and, I think, simple recommendation from the Commission of Audit was to abolish, merge and consolidate government departments, agencies, boards and committees. Over 60 per cent of them could have been dealt with in this manner, saving hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars every year. Another recommendation that I believe has strong support along the crossbench—and I look around at my colleagues here and I know they support it—was, among other things, to freeze members' and senators' pay. It might not have made a huge difference to the budget bottom line, but it would have sent a very strong message. If you want to make a significant difference to the budget bottom line, then freeze the pay of high-level bureaucrats as well, until they deliver a surplus. It is not too much to ask that those who keep delivering budgets in the red and formulating the policies that deliver such bad results for the Australian people should be held to account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This place is awash with red—red ink, red politics. It is 50 shades of badness. It is 50 shades of Labor. No-one here knows what a surplus looks like anymore. Treasurer after Treasurer after Treasurer tell us a surplus is around the corner. There is never any talk now of paying back debt, and one Liberal backbencher today said, 'Well, in 2021, if we deliver a surplus of $7 billion and we do that every year for the next 100 years, we'll be able to pay back the debt that we've got by then.' Does anyone really believe we are ever going to repay the debt that has been accumulated over the last 10 years and will possibly be accumulated over the next 10 years? I, for one, doubt it very, very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another dishonest aspect of this dishonest budget is the claim before budget night that the projections would be conservative. People love clinging to that term 'conservative', because it offers credibility and authenticity, but only if you actually adhere to what it means. The problem we have is that I am a conservative, and I can tell you that these budget forecasts are not conservative in any way, shape or form. They are either courageous, in the term of Sir Humphrey, or they are foolhardy. You can take your pick. The projections double down on Treasury's overestimation of GDP growth. Remember that Treasury have overspruiked GDP growth for the last five budgets before this one. Their projections have been absolutely wrong for eight of the last 11 budgets. But suddenly we believe their optimism is well founded now? Forgive me for my cynical questioning of that claim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Real GDP is estimated to be three per cent over the forward estimates. Unemployment is supposedly going to improve by over half a per cent, inflation is going to double to 2½ per cent and wages are going to grow by a massive 3¾ per cent. These are fanciful projections. They have already been panned for being overoptimistic. I repeat: they are dishonest, because the government said the projections would be conservative. And yet, privately, those who have been involved in Treasury deliberations will tell you that the best thing about forward estimates is that they have an inkling about what might happen next year, but years 3 and 4 are entirely guesstimates about what might happen in the economy. For goodness sake, they revise things from MYEFO to the budget, in six months, because they get that wrong, but now they can suddenly predict with such certainty this optimistic growth phase for our country?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So convinced are the government, so footloose are they with taxpayers' money, that they now are adopting Labor's policy. We were told today that they are going to lock in to legislate a minimum rate of three per cent funding for schools every year. You might welcome that, but what if growth projections are one per cent, or 1½ per cent? What if that is the reality about what we are dealing with? It creates a baseline for guaranteed school spending that pays no heed to economic conditions and pays no heed to educational outcomes. It is a recipe, once again, for waste, for rorting and for inefficiency if ever there was one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are talking about projections in education, let us talk about one herd of elephants that is coming over the horizon. It will stampede the budget projections. It is student debt. The government has failed to learn the lessons of the rorting and wastefulness of extending HELP debt or HECS, as I knew it—as it was then known to vocational students. The VET FEE-HELP scheme was a scam. It was a scam to the tune of billions of dollars. But higher education debt, supposedly that good debt—that equity investment from government given to universities so that students can graduate with degrees that they will not get proper jobs out of—has already tripled over the last 10 years to $30 billion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget office is predicting that, in the next 10 years, it will get to $180 billion—that is six times higher. It will, assuming the government does not ramp up other elements of national debt, increase students' share of the interest paid on national debt from 15 per cent, currently, to almost half the interest in the future—that is about $20 billion a year; almost half the interest of national debt will be accumulated by students for student loans. Remember: that is interest we are paying on the debt; it is not about paying back the debt—no-one is talking about that now; nobody talks about interest costs any more in this place. That is all we used to talk about—not publicly at least. We prefer not to talk about the fact that in 2020 there is going to be about $20 billion a year of interest costs payable. That would build a lot of roads and hospitals but, no, it is just going to be paid to bankers for the excessive spending of today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember also: this student debt, an estimated 20 per cent of it, will never be collected. That is about $36 billion. It is not accounted for anywhere in the budget bottom line. It is not accounted for in the forward projects. That is why it is fanciful, and they are rosy. They ignore the unwelcome reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wait—I say: there is more, unfortunately. It is a bit like deep space in science fiction novels. The coalition has joined Labor on a unity ticket in running dishonest budgets that promise things beyond the known universe of forward estimates. As I said: they ignore what they do not want to know, but they promise, as a virtue, money that they never will have to find themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor took us into deep space on the 'Starship Gonski'. It had the velocity of a spaceship. It did not move much in dollar terms in the near orbit but, once it got into the furthest reaches of them not being in government any more, the spending really ramped up. Quite rightly, it was condemned and criticised by those on this side of the chamber. But, now, because they cannot deal with it, they have adopted the same mantra themselves. There is no provision to pay for the extra $16 billion or $18 billion that has been promised outside of forward estimates. So what we have got now is a supposedly conservative government adopting another of Labor's 50 shades: firing up the 'Starship Gonski' because they think it is a quick political fix, but it is unfunded and it is unaffordable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So already we have got $16 billion in unfunded education. There is another $20 billion or so dollars in unfunded promises to build submarines in my home state of South Australia, and there is also going to be the ongoing costs of an ageing population. Superannuation is simply not going to meet the needs of many Australians. There will be an increasing demand upon pensions, and we are on that heady road that so many Western European nations have found themselves on: the road to unsustainable and unrepayable debt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something else that is threatening our economy that the government has not really sought to acknowledge—because if it did, it would not be running debt and deficits; it would be strengthening our economy against a global economic downturn. We are a trading nation. We run high deficits and debt at our peril. Our international sovereign debt comparisons, which so many in this place love to use, are not apt because, in our case, they never include the state and territory debts and, regrettably, we are also amongst the world champions of high household debt levels. So, if ratings agencies lose faith in our ability to sustain our borrowing practices or to repay the loans that we have, then global finance houses will also lose confidence and we will face a day of fiscal reckoning unseen in this country since the Great Depression. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our constant exposure to a regional or a global downturn is a truth that few in this place seem to want to understand. I thought the Liberal Party did until Tuesday night, but they seem to have abandoned that fiscal common sense. They now say, 'The other side seem to be having such a good time, so why don't we join them? Let's party like it's 1999 and pay no heed to the Y2K bug.' It sounds callous, but it is exactly what is happening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every principled statement the Liberal Party has made, every criticism of Labor the Liberal party has mounted, every talking point they have uttered criticising the Labor accounting position and provisions—all of it means nothing, because this government has adopted the same Labor approach. They have only a fig leaf of difference from the Labor Party. They are no longer conservatives, and the people are demanding a better way. There is a tried and tested way, a fiscally responsible way, that the Liberal Party once knew; it is now our way, a better way—a way for Australian Conservatives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  I rise to present One Nation's response to the 2017 Commonwealth Budget. This is my first budget reply speech on behalf on my colleagues. And, hopefully, if we have been doing our job listening to the people of Australia, we can deliver what needs to be addressed, so that we, as a nation, can move forward and repair the damage caused by consecutive governments and instil hope in all Australians that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, the current government was saddled with a debt of over $257 billion from the previous Labor government. It is now at $552 billion and rising, with an interest bill of $16.4 billion per year. The Treasurer declares; 'We don't have a revenue problem; we have a spending problem.' But I have to ask the Treasurer: why did he just sign up a further credit card debt of $600 billion instead of tearing it up and throwing it in the bin? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I and many other Australians are fed up with governments delivering budgets purely as vote winners. When are we going to see gutsy leadership that is long overdue to pull this country out of the ever-increasing mess and the hole we are digging ourselves into—one from which our future generations will never see the light of day?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asking for a 'please explain' on behalf of the Australian people. Why are we allowing multinationals to strip our nation of its natural resources, such as gas and oil, without paying adequate taxes and royalties that are the norm in many other countries around the world? These multinationals call us 'Treasure Island'—come on down and plunder and take what you want! We have one of the largest, if not the largest, gas fields in the world, yet Australians pay more for our gas than the countries who buy it from us, even after exploration and production costs. On top of that, we have an energy crisis, with out-of-control, overpriced energy costs that are destroying businesses and the family budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why haven't consecutive Australian governments kept sufficient energy resources to meet Australia's needs? If Australia had conducted business like many other countries around the world, such as Norway and Papua New Guinea, we would not have a debt. Let me put it this way: the budget shows that taxes on beer will generate $2.4 billion; and tobacco, $11.4 billion. This far exceeds our government budget figures of $1 billion for the petroleum resource rent tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that we have a profits based tax for gas, which is all too easy for multinational companies to rort and pay no tax. Instead, One Nation proposes that, like most other countries, we adopt a system of royalties paid on production. On gas alone, such a scheme would raise up to $10 billion per year, with anticipated revenues of around $400 billion over the life of the wells, and clearly multinational companies can afford this. Instead of just enriching multinational companies and sending our resources overseas to benefit other countries, this is just one example of how effective management of our nation's collective resource assets could transform our finances and enrich us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I talk about multinationals not paying their taxes here. I spoke to a minister recently, and they were thrilled about the fact that we are going to rein in, I think, $4 billion or $6 billion from multinationals. They thought that that was wonderful. I revert back to what Jim Killaly, the former Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, said in 1996—that we are losing $200 billion a year from multinationals not paying their taxes in Australia. I refer to <span style="font-style:italic;">Among the Barbarians</span>, written by Paul Sheehan in 1997. He said, 'With our 1953 double taxation agreement, we are losing out of our country $39 billion a year in taxes, and Australia only brings in $19 billion.' It can be addressed if the government, Liberal or Labor, is prepared to change legislation to ensure that the multinationals pay their fair share of tax in Australia and not go to the battlers or people who want to have a drink or a smoke, who are picking up the taxes and keeping this country going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that when Australians heard the Treasurer say that he was going to impose a levy on the banks we all thought: 'Great! It's about time.' I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the levy will be a tax deduction for the banks of approximately 30 per cent. Had the federal government brought it in as a tax on the bank, it would not be tax deductible. These costs imposed on banks—$6.2 billion over the next four years—will no doubt be recovered by the banks through higher interest rates on mortgages or decreased returns on savings, affecting each and every Australian. Shareholders will receive less returns on their shares, and this will impact on self-funded retirees, who are already struggling to maintain sufficient income streams. In fact, the levy amounts to an indirect taxation by the Treasurer on the Australian public. I think that this policy was made on the run. I do not believe enough investigation was put into this before it was brought in in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to turn to housing affordability. This budget does next to nothing about balancing the demand and supply of housing in areas where many people feel that they will never be able to afford a home. One Nation congratulates the government on the release of Defence land for housing. We also support the government's initiative to allow first home buyers to save within their super fund a sum of $30,000 towards their deposit on buying a property. My fellow senators and I also congratulate the government on its initiative to reduce the number of apartments in a development that can be sold to foreign nonresidents to 50 per cent, but this measure does not go far enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that Labor have been talking about housing affordability as if they worry about the people out there being able to find a home to rent. It was Labor in 2009 that made it that foreign developments could be sold fully to foreign investors. They got rid of the rule that 50 per cent must be sold to Australians. I congratulate the present government on reversing that and going back to 50 per cent having to be sold to Australian residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation wants all sales of established property to be only for Australians whose identity and right to buy is verified at the time of contract, with effective penalties and enforcement. How often do we hear from people that they believe foreign investors are buying established housing? Under our laws they are not allowed to, but this is not investigated; it is not policed. What we are saying is that at point of sale, on the contract, you must produce evidence: your passport, your citizenship or a document from the Foreign Investment Review Board saying that you have a right to buy that property.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation also believes that foreign nonresidents should not be able to buy established property. Likewise, in relation to new property, One Nation believes foreign nonresidents should be limited to one new property per person. We have 400,000 foreign students in Australia. They can buy established housing, but they must also sell that property when leaving Australia. This is not policed, so, if they buy a property and it is listed with the immigration department, that can be followed up if they leave the country and the property is not sold. One Nation would also force nonresidents who already own properties but do not live in or rent them to either do so or sell them to Australian residents within 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone knows the single-largest outlay in this budget is for welfare related programs. Australia has gone into debt to keep paying welfare. I will not deny support for those in genuine need, but we have too many people on welfare who are cheating the system. This is not a new problem, but something needs to be done to reduce welfare expenditure so that those in genuine need can be supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time for an identity card to be issued to every person who is entitled to receive taxpayer funds. We cannot carry the costs associated with people who are not entitled to support. This has been raised previously, with an Australia card, but what we are proposing is an identity card. People who are going to access taxpayer funded services must apply for it, they must present 100 points for it, it must have their photo and a chip in it with their details, and it must have some form of security, which would be the palm of their hand, which cannot be duplicated. For anyone who is going to apply for welfare or child support or goes to the doctor, gets a prescription or goes to hospital, let's make sure they are not rorting the system. There are too many aliases out there and too many illegal people in this country using their friends' and family's cards to visit a doctor, go to hospital or get prescriptions. People are rorting our system. There was a case in New South Wales where two brothers ripped off $27 million from taxpayers in childcare fraud, and there are numerous others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If people are concerned about this card and their privacy, I say to them: you have probably applied for a mobile phone, where you have to present all kinds of identification to get a $30 plan. This is more important. If you are not prepared to present your identification to prove who you are to get taxpayer funded services, you will pay full price for it. Our welfare payments at the moment are over the top and we need to rein them in. There are people in this country in multiple marriages, having multiple children and getting thousands of dollars a week and, on top of that, we are providing housing for them. We have to do something about it. Australians are screaming out that changes need to happen. The welfare budget is now so large that it is stopping us investing in the future. Most of the infrastructure we enjoy today was made possible by past generations, but, as the population grows, we need new investment. The government expects to spend $164 billion in the coming year on welfare, and that figure will increase as our population ages. We cannot keep borrowing for recurring expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation is not convinced the NDIS will be funded by the half-a-per-cent increase to the Medicare levy. This is another thing that needs to be raised. We have over 800,000 Australians—it is approaching that number—who are on the disability pension. In one case I was informed about, a woman applied for the disability pension because she had chronic fatigue. She was put on a disability pension, was receiving it for four years and was never called in for a test. We have to stop this rorting from happening. I believe that, on a yearly basis, those who are on a disability pension should be called before a government-appointed doctor to reapply for their disability pension, unless it is evident that they are truly in need of a disability pension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget represents a missed opportunity to build our nation. The government plans to spend $75 billion over 10 years on infrastructure. It sounds like a lot until you realise that, over this period, government revenue will be around $5,000 billion and welfare expenditure will be well over $2 billion. These figures show that the government's infrastructure plan is just token window-dressing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal to build a new freight rail line from Melbourne to Brisbane will only benefit regional Australians, if it stops at the towns on the route—there is no suggestion yet that it will. Instead, the government's proposed Melbourne-Brisbane rail link, using existing low-grade tracks, will support the alternative private consortium proposal building new high-speed rail lines. This will provide a cheaper, faster, safer and more accountable solution. The proposed rail link that the government is putting in will cost $10 billion and take over 10 years to build. Normally, anything the government does will blow out, so of course the cost is going to blow out. It is not going to go to the port, but the private proposal that they are planning will actually cost only $13 billion, be built in six years and actually be more beneficial to the people of Australia than the government's proposal. Too often we see that government proposals and plans to build anything in this country do not work. It is over-the-top costing, and I do not believe it is investigated enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, the much-hailed 'Snowy 2.0', while also sounding wonderful in principle, starts to wobble as soon as it gets out of the gate. This appears to have already been the subject of a feasibility assessment by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation about 30 years ago, which found that it was not a viable proposition, so the likelihood is that this too will be a fizzer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As announced by our parliamentary leader in Queensland, Steve Dickson, One Nation will build the visionary Bradfield scheme, which will divert water from North Queensland coastal rivers inland under the Great Dividing Range to irrigate a vast area of western Queensland the size of Tasmania and make the deserts bloom. An epic infrastructure project of around five times the size of the whole Snowy scheme, the Bradfield scheme will employ tens of thousands of people, hugely increase productive land and greatly increase the agricultural output of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hence, I now have to go to the Murray-Darling Basin. My colleagues and I just went on a three-day intensive tour of the Murray-Darling. It is costing Australian taxpayers $13 billion to buy back water and put in programs that are not going to work. We saw a program that is denying farmers, small businesses, industries, communities and councils the right to the water that will help them survive. We are shutting them down. We are saying, 'You will not have the water supply.' Water is the lifeblood of this nation. Why have we got individuals—who have no connection with the land and who are not farmers—who have the right to own water in this land? Why have we got multinationals and others who have bought water rights in Australia? And, yet, our farmers are crying out for more water so they can increase their production and are ripping out their trees because they have got no water. And yet, we are intent on allowing the size of the Hume Dam—approximately 3,000 gigalitres—to flow down the Murray and out to sea, which is not going to flood the entrance of the Murray-Darling. It is sheer madness, and the fact is that this and the $13 billion that the government is putting into this needs to be looked at. I saw farmers on their knees, losing their properties and their homes for the cost of something that belongs to every Australian: the water that falls out of the sky. Yet we are charging them thousands of dollars and destroying their livelihoods and their businesses all so big organisations or individuals can reap the rewards of it at their expense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am happy with the increase in legal aid to community legal centres and Aboriginal legal aid, the government has ignored our request for an increase in legal aid generally to the tune of $200 million, which would have alleviated the burden on the courts, particularly the Family Court. Every member in this parliament knows that the Family Court and the issues that are happening there are devastating families. We need to put more resources into it. I would have dearly loved to have seen more money put into the Family Court, with registrars and with legal aid supporting and helping this, because the average family normally has to wait three years before their case can be heard. We see fathers and some mums out there suiciding over this, yet we are not addressing this matter of great concern. I see too much waste that is happening. There are Australian people who are crying out for assistance and it distresses me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the massive program of construction of coal and gas fired power stations. We must go ahead with this. We must implement them to give us cheap power so that we can have industries and manufacturing and to lower the cost of living for the average family out there. The rising cost is nearly doubling. In Western Australia it has gone up approximately 72 per cent in a year. In Queensland we have the highest wholesale price of electricity. We have seen the power station in South Australia close. Now it has been Victoria. Yet we keep pouring more and more money into climate change—billions of dollars—and it is going nowhere. We have the Greens saying, 'We've got to support wind power. We've got to support solar power.' We cannot run the country on that with the population, the industries and manufacturing we have. We need coal fired base power load in Australia to run this country. I see the billions of dollars that are going into this and I just feel that we need a real debate to make sure this happens.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Student debt is blowing out of all proportion. With the vocational education and training debt plus the HECS debt, it is approximately $52 billion. No-one is really reining this in. You have to pay it back at $54,000, so I do say the government is trying to do something about it, but to pull it back to $42,000 before you start paying your debt back is not good enough. An education in Australia is all well and good, but if you are going to go on and do course after course and expect that you are going to become a professional student at the cost of the taxpayer when we have not got the money and we are borrowing it, you have to face up to your responsibilities. You cannot do it. I have no problem with giving a helping hand. It was One Nation policy that once you start earning $22,000 then you start paying back the taxpayer. When you are on $22,000, paying back two per cent is not much, because some of these people can go out on the town and spend over $100 on drinks and having a good night out—sometimes it is even more than that. They have a responsibility to the Australian taxpayer, and it cannot be taken for granted anymore. Let me put the vocational education and training debt into perspective. In 2009 it was around $25 million. By 2016 it was over $6 billion in debt, and we are looking at over $185 billion by 2025-26, which is going to be 46.3 per cent of our national debt. So these are people who have been given the opportunity of a higher education, and then they leave and they go overseas and they do not pay their debt back. I believe that we need to rein that in. We need to do something about it. And it is the taxpayers' money. It is an opportunity that has been given to them. A lot of other countries around the world do not give their people this opportunity. But I feel that we are being taken for granted and abused.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the government on reining in the 457 visa. We need jobs in Australia for Australians, and the apprenticeship scheme that the government is introducing and the money it will create. I hope that the government will actually look at an apprenticeship scheme, as One Nation has proposed, where the government pays, in the first year, 75 per cent of the wage; in the second year, 50 per cent of the wage; and, in the third year, 25 per cent of the wage. Businesses have approached me, and I have spoken to them about this. They would jump at the opportunity to put on apprentices. I congratulate the government on starting the intern scheme. That is wonderful for a short period of time; hopefully, it might turn into a full-time job. But, with an apprenticeship, those youths, or, maybe, the older generations who want to take on an apprenticeship, will have a job for the long term, and we will have our own trades men and women, and not be bringing in skilled migrants from overseas or 457 visa holders to fill these positions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN is costing this country an absolute fortune, and I am talking around $55 billion to $60 billion a year—sorry; I retract that; it is not 'a year' but 'in total'. The NBN will fail. It will be out of date. And that is why many Australians are not taking it up. I believe that we should look wisely at how we spend this money and make sure that we have an up-to-date NBN that is going to be, on the world stage, as good as any other country's, but I fear that we are throwing good money at something that is not going to be beneficial to this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we in One Nation hope for is a vision to return our nation to unparalleled wealth and happiness. I would like to see back again the day when we were on the sheep's back and had prosperity. I want to see industries and manufacturing, and I was disappointed to see that the government did not express that in their budget papers. In contrast to every other party, One Nation's vision is for a new golden age of prosperity, accountability and integrity, unity and progress, in which all Australians will share.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:33</span>):  Today, just two days after the 2017 budget was delivered, it is time to acknowledge the mistreatment of Australia's taxpayers, amongst the longest-suffering peoples on this land, in a budget in which those taxpayers—the ones who pay for all that the government does; the diminishing minority—once again copped a hammering. We reflect, in particular, on the systematic punishment meted out to wealth creators and on the relentless grab of their hard-earned money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of myself, my party and those who share my views, I apologise for the laws and policies of successive coalition and Labor governments that inflicted a profound loss of wealth on our people, deprived them of their liberties, and then took pride in recklessly spending their money. On their behalf, I say: I am deeply sorry about the sheer greed of those in power who believe they are entitled to an ever and ever larger share of other people's money, and their fake generosity—transforming giving away other people's money into an art form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can we take a minute now to reflect on how this money was grabbed in this budget and how it was wasted? It was grabbed from wage and salary earners who suffer higher and higher taxes each year through bracket creep, grabbed from the customers and shareholders of banks, grabbed from the people who already pay most of the tax via a higher Medicare levy, grabbed from those who employ foreign workers because they need their skills and grabbed from those who smoke cigars and roll their own cigarettes, leading more and more to switch to the illicit market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments, over decades past, Labor and Liberal, right up to the present day, have imposed a myriad of income taxes, company taxes, sales and consumption taxes, tariffs, excises, levies and stamp duties, and then they strangled creativity with red tape. Then there is the waste. It is wasted on welfare for those on middle-class incomes, like childcare subsidies for those on very high incomes, when it should be for the poor—up to $350,000 a year; wasted on welfare for over 800,000 people who are not Australian citizens; and wasted on nearly two million public servants and all their spending. How can a nation of 23 million possibly need two million public servants? It is wasted on Aboriginal welfare—failing to improve their welfare and not closing the gap; wasted on antibusiness, environmental and industrial laws that cost thousands their jobs; and wasted on duplicated Commonwealth and state departments, such as health, education and environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past. Unfortunately, that cannot occur under either a coalition or Labor government. As the budget has shown, one is no better than the other. They differ only in terms of how they rack up ever more deficits and debt—whether to rack up deficits and debt is never questioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a party that does not believe in deficits and debt and that has a plan to do something about them, we can look to the Liberal Democrats. Our 20 per cent flat tax would turn Australia into a magnet for wealth creation. And our plan to abolish import tariffs, alcohol tax, tobacco tax and fuel tax would dramatically cut the cost of living. We could then focus welfare on the needs of the truly poor, support our defence forces and justice system, and maintain and improve our infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all the needless pain, suffering and hurt caused by outrageous taxes and regulations, we say sorry. For taxing and harassing the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, the value creators and their valued creations, we say sorry. To those people who have created wealth for everybody else and who were then publicly vilified and pilloried, we say sorry. I offer you this apology without qualification. But now we must move forward with hope renewed and condemn this sorry state of affairs to the scrap heap of history. The Liberal Democrats will never vote for a reduction in your liberties. We will never vote for an increase in taxes, and we will always vote for a tax reduction.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:38</span>):  I am so pleased to be able to make this budget-in-reply speech on behalf of my colleagues Senators Griff and Kakoschke-Moore and the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie, from the other place, because we represent not just the state of South Australia; we represent the political centre. We look at issues not from ideology, not from the left or right, but with practical solutions to real problems that must be addressed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures contained in this budget will be the subject of literally millions of words of reporting, analysis, commentary and debate in the coming months. On behalf of my colleagues in this place and in the other place, I say this: we welcome, unambiguously, the specific measures we have collectively fought for, lobbied for and negotiated for in this budget. They are all measures which we believe are not only good for our fellow South Australians but, very much, in the interest of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Advanced Manufacturing Growth Fund of $100 million over the next two years, targeted at South Australia and Victoria, is long overdue. My home state and Victoria face a tsunami of job losses when car manufacturing in our nation ends in October this year, in less than 160 days. This fund will stimulate advanced manufacturing and research projects and will create advanced manufacturing innovation labs in South Australia and Victoria which will serve industry in a variety of roles, including test centre facilities and business capability development. It will also help to maintain engineering excellence, with engineering and student research through universities, technological institutions and industry in order to maintain the flow of highly trained engineers to the automotive design and engineering industry, rather than seeing an exodus of our best and brightest overseas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Fund of almost $50 million of new funding committed over the next two years will help dozens and dozens of innovative advanced manufacturing businesses in South Australia and Victoria to grow, to flourish, to find new markets and to develop new products and processes—and with it, to employ many hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians displaced by the closure of automotive manufacturing in this country—companies such as Supashock in Magill in South Australia, which design and manufacture state-of-the-art shock absorbers used the world over in racing vehicles and high-performance vehicles, where the drivers tell me that the difference between winning and losing those races is put down to the superior handling they get from the Supashock product developed in South Australia over many years. There are other businesses in South Australia, such as REDARC, with their automotive electronics, and Australian Clutch Services, that are itching to get an opportunity to grow their businesses with this fund. Across the border in Victoria, companies such as Quickstep, Dolphin Products and, of course, Carbon Revolution, all have an opportunity to bid for this fund and to employ so many more Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a crisis that we face in terms of jobs, and we must address it. Australian manufacturing has declined from 12 per cent of GDP to just over six per cent in the last decade. Of course much more needs to be done, but we now have $100 million more than we did a week ago, and we all worked very hard to make sure that that happened. I see this as a down payment on something much bigger once the government sees the enormous economic flow-on effects of this—the multiplier effects, the effects of having more technology and research, the jobs it will create and the intellectual property it will create that we can export to the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I and my colleagues will also push for the Fraunhofer model, which has been such a great success in Germany, and involves collaboration between industry, universities and other research organisations as well as international collaboration to serve the needs of small and medium enterprises. Going from strength to strength since 1949, it has been a great success in Germany, a country that is similar to ours—a high-wage country, a country that is all about developing advanced manufacturing, where their share of manufacturing as a percentage of GDP is not six per cent, as it is here in Australia, but 22 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to jobs, the apprenticeship mentoring program which my colleague Senator Griff has been instrumental in will have a positive impact on the lives of 45,000 apprentices across the nation, thousands of those in my home state. This program of $60 million worth of funding over the next two years is targeted and highly effective. It is a very, very good use of taxpayers' money. For instance, in South Australia alone, previous mentoring programs in the automotive industry—for mechanics, panel beaters, spray painters and associated trades—lifted completion rates from an industry average of around 50 per cent to a massive 91 per cent, but in 2014 the government decided to axe the program to save money in the budget. It was the worst form of false economy, because we saw a plummeting of those completion rates. Apprentices did not complete their apprenticeships, because mentoring was so critical to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague, Senator Griff, said, axing the program was a dumb choice. It certainly was, but reinstating it is a smart decision that will help to fill a chronic shortage of trained workers. In South Australia alone, the automotive retail service and repair sector is in desperate need of trained workers, and its industry association, the Motor Trade Association, is very excited to see the introduction of this new, updated mentoring program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to supplementary local road funding for South Australia, that is something that my colleague Rebekha Sharkie, the member for Mayo, has been an outspoken advocate for. She travels a lot of roads in the Adelaide Hills. It is a big electorate. She does thousands of kilometres each week, it seems. She is wearing that car of hers out. This announcement, whilst modest, is $40 million more than we had a week ago. It is $40 million over two years that will be poured back into council-managed roads in South Australia, including more than $2.3 million for the Adelaide Hills, for Mount Barker, for Victor Harbor, for Yankalilla, for Kangaroo Island, for Barossa and for the Onkaparinga Council in Mayo. This money was cut in the 2014 budget, creating a huge gap in the funding allocation to South Australian roads compared to other states. This is something that the member for Mayo has advocated for long and hard. We got that result. It is important for those country roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the solar thermal plant for Port Augusta—something that all of us have been very passionate about. The budget announcement of a $110 million equity loan will make a huge difference. It will be the tipping point to get this project off the ground, to build the solar thermal plant at Port Augusta and to get it across the line. Not only will it mean virtual baseload renewable energy of a 100-megawatt plant, it will create 1,050 jobs in the construction phase, with a flow-on effect of another 3,000 jobs. And it will drive advanced manufacturing and research not just in South Australia but nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to the community of Port Augusta, to its former mayor, the late great colourful Joy Baluch, and to its current mayor, Sam Johnson. They have both championed this project. Sam Johnson has been such a great advocate for this program. I also want to say that the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, is someone who has also advocated for this project. I will work with him because this is an issue that goes beyond politics—to make sure that this happens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Proton therapy is a form of cancer treatment that is state of the art. It is much more advanced than ordinary forms of radiotherapy. The beams can be targeted for difficult and hard-to-treat cancers, particularly pediatric cancers, brain cancers, spinal cancers and so many other cancers where the beam is targeted and it stops where it is needed so it does not cause damage to surrounding tissue. There is not one proton therapy centre in the southern hemisphere, but there will be now in the next three years in South Australia in Adelaide at the new SAHMRI. The $68 million one-off capital payment, plus changes to Medicare schedule, will ensure that proton therapy will finally come to Australia. It is not just for South Australia; it is for all of Australia and the entire region, and for the goodwill it will bring. Importantly, it will save, literally, thousands of lives in the years to come. It will mean the best and brightest from around the world in medical research will be drawn to this proton therapy centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of the people who I have worked with on this. I had many discussions with the Prime Minister, with the health minister, with Minister Birmingham and with Premier Weatherill in South Australia. It is an issue that is beyond politics. It is about saving lives and, also, driving excellence in innovation and driving this medical research that will save lives. The fact that the dean of the Harvard Medical School believed that the South Australian proposal was by far the most advanced and the best is something that is to be commended. I am looking forward to it. Just a few days ago when I was in Sydney speaking at the Cure Brain Cancer Foundation, Professor Charlie Teo, one of the great brain surgeons not just in this country but in the world, was so thrilled when the announcement was made last Saturday. It was about Australia having a proto<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#FF0000;&#xD;&#xA;  ">n</span> therapy centre—finally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about other issues that have not got the attention they deserve in the budget. But they do deserve our attention; they are important issues. One is the issue of defence abuse. The way that some of the men and women who have served our country over the years have been treated—some of them subjected to the most horrendous abuse without any forms of redress in the past—must be addressed. I commend and praise my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore for her ongoing advocacy for those victims of abuse. The budget, as a result of Senator Kakoschke-Moore's advocacy, includes some $30 million for victims of sexual and physical abuse in the Australian Defence Force over the years. It means that a fund previously set up through the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce will now be able to continue through the Defence Force Ombudsman. It means that many people who missed out on Defence abuse compensation will now be able to get that, because arbitrary cut-off dates will no longer be applied. That is very important. I know how many people Senator Kakoschke-Moore has advocated for. Their moving stories cannot be ignored, and this at least provides some redress. Of course there are more details, and Senator Kakoschke-Moore will advocate to make sure that the fund is working effectively and well and fairly. That is very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about another issue involving our veterans. I know that we will be hearing from Senator Lambie soon, but one issue that I have campaigned for—that we have all campaigned for—relates to British nuclear test participants. Finally there will be some justice for Australia's nuclear test veterans, for the 1,100 survivors of the 17,000 who were part of the Maralinga, Monte Bello and Emu Field tests in this country, as well as the thousands who served in the British occupation forces in Japan, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in the aftermath of World War II. They will get the gold card—finally some recognition for what they went through and for the illnesses that they suffer, instead of having to jump through bureaucratic hoops to prove, seemingly beyond doubt, that they were subject to illnesses due to that radiation exposure. That was a very unreasonable and onerous burden. This will make a difference. This $137 million will transform lives and be a belated recognition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something else that we negotiated for that may not seem that important in the scheme of things and it may not cost that much. It is community radio—the 440 stations across the nation that many hundreds of thousands of Australians listen to, that many thousands of volunteers are part of and that are an integral part of our communities. There will be $6.1 million allocated over the next two years, and it has been terrific to work with the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield, on this. This will provide diversity and difference. That capital injection will mean the difference between many of those station staying open and closing or restricting their activities. That is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will have an opportunity to discuss measures in the budget in detail in relation to school funding and higher education. That will be the subject, appropriately, of Senate inquiries. But I want to address the whole issue of the bank levy. We support the principle of the bank levy, subject to two associated issues being dealt with. Firstly, we need to have a last resort compensation scheme for victims of financial mismanagement and fraud. I and my colleagues have seen the victims of, for instance, managed investment schemes. We cannot blame the banks for that. Those managed investment schemes were a creature of this parliament from 2004 to 2007, when they were set up, and literally many thousands of Australians have been devastated financially by those schemes. We need a last resort compensation scheme in this country. I know that the Ramsay review has been looking at it, but it must be put in place. I acknowledge that, if you have been the victim of bad financial advice from a bank, at least you know the bank has the dough to cough up compensation, even though the method of compensation and the processes need to be improved dramatically. But we know that they are there. But too many businesses have gone into liquidation, too many financial advisers have gone bankrupt, leaving no redress for those many thousands of victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is one matter that I believe must be addressed in the bank levy. It is something that we will push for, because there is an anomaly here. The levy as currently proposed excludes foreign banks operating in Australia. This has the perverse impact of according almost a preferred status to foreign banks over Australian banks in the latter's home market. There are a number of these banks that are global in size and reach, and they compete with precisely the same types of lending that are targeted by the levy. That is, in particular, lending to large corporations and institutions, as well as lending for home loans. In both cases, HSBC and ING are significant lenders. Those foreign banks should not be excluded from this levy. Indeed, if the primary purpose of this measure is to raise revenue then this would be much better met by their inclusions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the global liabilities of just three foreign banks active in Australia—with ING, BNP Paribas and HSBC—a levy of just six basis points on those three banks and their Australian liabilities would raise $179 million per annum, almost $800 million over the forward estimates, which I believe would be a very significant contribution to a last resort compensation scheme. This is something that is long overdue. We cannot credibly have a levy on Australian banks without also applying it to those foreign banks operating in Australia. And additional money raised must be used for that last resort compensation scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about infrastructure. I know I got derision from some of my colleagues when I talked about the $70 billion of infrastructure commitments set out in the budget, but the fact remains that $3.1 billion of that infrastructure spend has been allocated to South Australia, which is some 4.5 per cent of the total spend. South Australia' share of population growth is 7.1 per cent. We have something like 12 per cent of the nation's local road network.</span>

                  </a>  The cries are, 'You're getting all this naval shipbuilding.' The fact is that, in the next financial year, only $319 million has been allocated for the Future Submarine project, and most of that will go overseas for the French design teams in France, before relocating Australians as part of the advance design teams to France, and for the US combat systems in the United States. Very little of it will come back to Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget does mention $270 million for the supply ships. But guess what? That is $270 million that will be spent largely on propping up jobs in Spain—not here in Australia—and that is something that must be noted. We also must note that South Australia has the highest unemployment rate in the nation. That is something that we must take into account with this anaemic infrastructure spend for South Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am pleased that the government is committing to some significant rail projects: $8.4 billion to the Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail and other rail projects that of critical importance to the nation's infrastructure. There must however be an absolute guarantee that we use Australian steel—structural steel from Arrium in Whyalla and rolling steel from Port Kembla in New South Wales. This is very important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very proud of the work that we have done, in negotiations with Senator Cormann, the finance minister, on the procurement rules in this country being changed dramatically. From 1 March this year we have had a situation where, for the first time, Australian standards must be considered and employment, environmental and occupational health and safety practices must be considered in any procurement decision. And, for the first time, the economic impact of any procurement of over $4 million must be taken into account. These are important issues, and we intend to ensure that the government lives up to not only the words of that procurement document—the procurement rules—but also the spirit of it to ensure that we maximise Australian industry participation in these projects.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention a few other matters that relate to some big-ticket numbers, such as Badgerys Creek and $5.3 billion for the Western Sydney Airport—long overdue. I note the comments of the Wagner brothers, who developed Toowoomba airport, which is referred to as the Wellcamp airport. It is a pretty remarkable piece of infrastructure, developed privately and without any government funding, and it was delivered at a fraction of the price that it would have been if a government project had delivered the same sort of airport—an airport that can land jumbo jets, large aircraft and international aircraft. I know that one of the Wagners was on the ABC just a few days ago saying, '$5.3 billion sounds too much; we can do it cheaper.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must, when we spend taxpayers' money, work out the best and most effective way of spending that money so that we do not waste it. And that also goes for defence spending. I support the two per cent target, but we must make sure that we do not have the debacles of the past, such as the $1.4 billion for the Seasprite helicopters that never actually flew in service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to energy prices, of course it is of critical importance that this country lowers its energy prices, and that is why we unambiguously support a scheme that I, and the then opposition leader, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, put forward back in 2009—an emissions intensity scheme. It was condemned by Labor then as a mongrel of a scheme; I note that now it is Labor Party policy, so it seems that the mongrel has become the top dog. We need to have certainty for investment in this country in energy infrastructure, and we need to tackle head-on the gas crisis in this country. With my colleagues, we have worked constructively with government for a number of measures of transparency in the gas markets. But we need to go further and have tough competition laws, and make sure we have export control so that we have enough domestic gas, and we need to get tough on the 'use it or lose it' policy, to make sure that people do not hoard their retention leases and gas is not there for the domestic market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about other measures that my colleagues have expressed real concerns about. We believe that this budget has failed older Australians. It has provided no additional funding over the next four years for the massive increases in older Australians requiring aged care—in short, it has failed the over-65s. There are over 200,000 Australians in residential aged care. There appear to be no policies to help to meet the increasing need for residential places. And, even more concerning, we are only providing half the required number of places that the Aged Care Financing Authority says we need. This budget does nothing to increase the home care support that older Australians rely on to remain safely in their homes. The budget provides an incentive to the over-65s who want to downsize to contribute $300,000 from their home sale into their superannuation; however, that amount and more will be absorbed by the significant fees nursing homes charge for a residential place. So, much more needs to be done. We need a comprehensive approach to aged care that allows all Australians to live their latter years with dignity and care.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to palliative care—and I know that Senator Lambie may talk about the particular impact, the cruel impact, in her home state and in South Australia—why on earth would we slash, in effect, home palliative care in this country, where people can die at home with dignity and with their loved ones? It makes good economic sense but, above all, good social sense.</span>

                  </a>  Well, there is a real concern that foreign aid is well below the millennium goal of 0.7 per cent, and that is something that we are concerned about. We need to lift foreign aid because that is what we should do as a wealthy nation, and it builds resilience in our near neighbours and is a bulwark against fundamentalism and extremism. It makes good sense.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the Medicare levy, we will consider that. We think we need to fund the NDIS adequately, but we want to look at the details of that. Also, we believe that the deficit levy for those who earn more than $180,000 ought to be kept in place. We welcome the housing affordability measures in this budget, but we believe more needs to be done. And, when it comes to our institutions being strong and robust, we will continue to pursue reforms to whistleblower protection laws which we believe would lead to better governance and government, both in our corporate and public sectors.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to finish off with a long-forgotten piece written for <span style="font-style:italic;">The West Australian</span> in 1950 by Bertrand Russell, one of the greatest philosophers of the last two centuries. Bertrand Russell had visited Australia and made good friends here in 1950, and he spoke of a country whose future would surely be better than its past and which had greatness in its grasp. This is what Russell wrote, in a warning to his new-found Australian friends—a warning that has even more force today. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Perhaps you are all to comfortable to take so much trouble. Perhaps you will be content with a moderate and humdrum success, but I hope not. I hope that the more adventurous and enterprising spirits among you will be inspired by a golden vision of a possible future, and will be content to take the risks involved in aiming at a great success rather than acquiesce in the comfortable certainty of a modest competence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We share Russell's hope for Australia, particularly for my home state of South Australia, and we hope that the vision and noble aspiration of Russell is something that, in a sense, will guide us in the decisions we make on this budget, because we want the very best for our nation and for our home state.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:05</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate regarding Treasurer Scott Morrison's 2017 budget. I would like to take this moment to thank the Liberal government for its one-off funding commitment to the Mersey Community Hospital of about $730 million. Thank you for listening to the concerns of the Mersey community and to my concerns and those of the Labor Party regarding a lack of long-term vision for the hospital. I and my Tasmanian constituents still have concerns about what will happen in 10 years when the funding deal runs out and the Mersey Community Hospital is in the hands of the state government, who have proven, so far, to be incompetent when it comes to running the public health system in Tasmania. I strongly encourage health minister Greg Hunt to intervene in the state health minister's management of the health system in Tasmania and protect the lives of Tasmanians. The state of the health system is at breaking point, and Tasmanians are needlessly suffering. Our nurses, doctors and paramedics are overworked, with many being asked to work three or more shifts in a row. In Tasmania, it is now normal for our medical staff to work double shifts because they are so under-resourced. This is an important matter to me, and I will not stop lobbying until the federal government intervenes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank the federal government for listening to my call to fund Missiondale Recovery Centre in Tasmania. Missiondale has a high success rate and a proven track record of rehabilitating those with substance abuse issues, and it makes sense to grant them the funds instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. This funding will allow Missiondale to dedicate more funds and time to the work of rehabilitating people by resourcing beds that already exist.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are talking about rehabilitation, let me tell you about a centre that will go ahead in Tasmania soon. The Home of Hope is a rehabilitation centre for mums and bubs, a safe place where women with substance abuse issues can escape traumatic environments with their children. There is a proverb that says, 'It takes a village to raise a child,' and the Home of Hope will be situated in the beautiful and caring community called the Meander Valley, a community that is happy to be a part of the healing process for these women and their children. But the Home of Hope has received no government funding because it was set up by religious organisation Teen Challenge. I admit my son did his rehab with Teen Challenge in Queensland. But—when statistics state Teen Challenge has a success rate of 86 per cent, with over a thousand centres in a hundred different countries, which makes the organisation one of the most effective in the world—I would hope that the Liberal government will consider granting ongoing funds to the Home of Hope in the next budget, as a way to help these women escape domestic violence situations and rehabilitate substance abuse issues. This will be the first mums-and-bubs rehab centre in this country, and I am very proud to be a part of that. In the meantime, I am the one out there raising the funds, and I have to raise about half a million dollars this year. I am going to be throwing in everything I can in the next six months. It would be nice for the government to consider putting some funding into these mums and bubs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was disappointing to see that the budget included around $70 billion in infrastructure spending over the next 10 years, yet there was no new infrastructure spending for Tasmania. I am sure you are aware that the Bridgewater Bridge near Hobart desperately needs to be replaced. At 70 years old, the bridge has suffered constant maintenance issues, including lifting span malfunctions. With a price tag of $535 million attached, it is costly infrastructure that the state government cannot fund on its own. It is a necessary project, with an average of 18½ thousand vehicles crossing it each day, according to the Tasmanian government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's budget does provide funding for a plan for the Snowy Mountains Scheme 2.0, but fails to provide any funding for a second Basslink cable, which would have been a good investment opportunity for the Tasmanian economy. New pumped hydrotechnology together with a second Basslink cable would have seen renewable energy investment in Tasmania, with opportunities to export more power to the mainland. That would have put Tasmania in a position to assist our cousins in South Australia during electricity shortages. Because Tasmania already has a baseload power in its Hydro, greater renewable investment would not affect the reliability of power in Tasmania but would increase the island state's exporting capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greater export capacity is a double dividend for taxpayers, because further jobs would be created in Tasmania in the renewable energy industry while providing cheaper electricity to the mainland, giving Tasmania the opportunity to make more profits for its balance sheets and therefore be less reliant on government handouts. The Liberal government's failure to fund a plan on a second Basslink cable shows that it is a government with horse blinker on and is incapable of broad energy planning for the future of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget fails to address bringing in an appropriate royalty regime in the natural gas industry. The petroleum resource rent tax, otherwise known as PRRT, is grossly inadequate because it is not delivering real economic paybacks for Australia to re-invest in infrastructure. Once these fossil fuels are depleted they are gone forever and our nation will have nothing to show for it because it failed to collect proper royalties. Some royalty regimes have been implemented at a state level; however, there has been a failure to consistently implement such at the federal level. This results in extraction of natural gas without Australia being reimbursed for its natural resource. By next year, the Reserve Bank estimates that liquefied natural gas—otherwise known as LNG—is likely to become Australia's second largest commodity export in value terms. Because Asia is increasingly importing LNG for electricity production, this demonstrates that the Australian government should benefit from the extraction of our fossil fuel resources. The government's 2017-18 budget fails in addressing these important energy issues, just as it fails to appropriately address the issue of housing affordability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's plan, outlined in the budget, to allow first home buyers to salary sacrifice their deposit savings into their superannuation and to unlock supply will not go far enough to help those who really need it. I have developed a housing affordability package that I believe will be a gentle approach and I would like to see it discussed in a mature and open-minded manner. My proposal includes a cap on the number of houses that can be negatively geared and the removal of the capital gains tax exemption on houses worth more than $2 million. I would also like to see foreign investment in the housing market reduced at a taper rate of 10 per cent per year for five years, until foreign investment in the housing market has been reduced by 50 per cent and then reassess the situation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also allow access to superannuation for first home buyer deposits but would cap access at five per cent of the house price up to $500,000, with a requirement that the buyer matches at least 50 per cent of the super contribution. For example, if you want to buy a house valued at $500,000, the first home buyer would be able to access $25,000 from their super for their deposit but they would have to match it at 50 cents to the dollar and therefore would have to put $12,500 in. Lastly, boosting supply is a vital part of any housing affordability scheme and can be achieved by reviving a first home buyers grant for new homes and a first home builders grant to be funded by the states, as we have previously seen. This would get them close to a $40,000 to $50,000 deposit for their first home of up to $500,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the media are reporting that this budget is a Labor budget, I can assure you that there are still signs of the Liberals in it. The higher education reforms proposed in this budget have the Liberals all over it, asking students to take on a greater burden. There are already so many barriers for students of disadvantaged families that a jump in fees and a requirement to pay the HECS debt back sooner will only deter students from this group from continuing their education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">University carries with it the promise of a better future and the potential to earn more. So, if a university graduate is earning $42,000 a year, I do not imagine that they are in a career where they can use their university degree—and that is a failure on the government's behalf. It is a failure to stimulate the economy and create jobs for our university graduates. I imagine if my Liberal colleagues had ever been on a salary of $42,000 they would know that every dollar counts. Even a one per cent repayment places pressure on that person's budget, especially if they have family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice the budget also proposes to reduce funding for Catholic schools. When the legislation presents in the Senate I will be moving to exempt Catholic schools in rural and regional Australia, because it is those schools who are helping disadvantaged students and families. I am just going to explain that a little further. My children went through the public system until high school. Then, when they went to high school, I was able to put them into Catholic education, that being St Brendan-Shaw College in Devonport. I started to run into a lot of financial difficulties, and my children had the opportunity to stay there even though I could not pay the fees. They were able to do that because of the school funding they received. I know there are a lot of single mums and low-income families out there who want to give their kids the best possible chance in life. If that means that we can just scrape together a little bit more money to give them a better education and better discipline through the private system, then we will do that. But if you take that away from those people, you will make the divide even greater, because it will not give people like me, who are going through what I went through, the opportunity to give their kids a better start during their teenage years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The removal of the deficit levy was also a sign of the Liberals' involvement in this budget. While the richest Australians are getting a tax break, everyone else is getting a tax increase in the Medicare levy. While 0.5 per cent may not seem like much to my colleagues, once again, to a low-income earner, it is enough to break the bank. As I have mentioned already in this speech, a low-income earner has every cent accounted for, and a 0.5 per cent tax increase takes away their ability to pay for life's basics. Going forward, I will be discussing with my colleagues how to increase the threshold for the Medicare levy to at least $40,000—and, quite frankly, I would make it a lot more—for a single person and reintroduce the deficit levy to make up for the gap in funding for the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, if anybody had had any idea what it would be like to pay for medical conditions and support, they should have looked at veterans' affairs, because they underestimated the cost of the NDIS. It does not matter who did it, you underestimated it. You may have put the money away, but you short-changed yourselves. That is okay; these people are disadvantaged, and I am sure most Australians that can afford it will not mind paying a little bit extra. But, certainly, those who are not paying tax—the big boys up there, the boys at the big end of town—need to pay their fair share. It is time they did their heavy lifting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By now, you have probably heard that I have asked for politicians to take random drug testing and alcohol testing. I admire the politicians who have stood up since then and said they would willingly take random drug tests. This is not a political stunt. I believe politicians must lead the way if they expect welfare recipients to be drug tested, as this year's budget states. A trial for 5,000 welfare recipients to undertake random drug tests at Centrelink appointments is discrimination, which is unhelpful in overcoming substance abuse. Creating greater stigma around welfare recipients will not help rehabilitate people with substance abuse issues. As my mother always says, 'What's good for the goose is good for the gander.' Politicians and public servants are also paid by the taxpayer and should be held to the same, if not a higher, standard as an unemployed person being paid by the taxpayer. The government must stop its discrimination against Australians on welfare and be willing to step up to the plate themselves. Politicians have an opportunity to set an example and send a clear message to welfare recipients, 'We are in this together,' which, at the very least, is a show of support. I did appreciate the government's promise to rehabilitate any welfare recipient at the first positive test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was particularly pleased to see the government take up the cashless debit card for this group as well. It is not news for my colleagues that I would like to see it rolled out all across Tasmania as well. The substance abuse in regional Tasmania is one of the highest in the nation, and intergenerational welfare dependency is also higher in Tasmania. And, because Tasmania is an island, it makes the perfect trial site. It is isolated. The cashless debit card will be the kick-start we need to break the welfare cycle. But I will not support it unless the government implements support services alongside it, otherwise there is no point implementing it. If there are not enough rehab centres and mental health services and programs or jobs, the cashless debit card may as well not be implemented. It will be a waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education and industry need to be in lockstep to ensure Australia is producing graduates with relevant skills who have a job waiting for them at the end of their qualification. Twiggy Forrest has said Australia is one of the most educated unemployed countries in the world, and many qualifications are not translating into jobs. To make matters worse, the Job Services Australia system is costing the government $1.3 billion a year, yet the unemployment rate is not moving. If you read Twiggy Forrest's <span style="font-style:italic;">Creating Parity</span>, you will find only five per cent of employers use the Job Services Australia system to find workers. It does not meet employer needs and trains for the sake of training. The government claims the Job Services Australia system is outcomes based, yet only eight per cent of their funding is at risk if jobseekers do not hold a job for 26 weeks. On the other hand, Vocational Training and Employment Centres—VTEC—services put 100 per cent of their funding on the line if jobseekers cannot retain work for 26 weeks. It is this VTEC model which the government should be funding for all Australians. It connects jobseekers with guaranteed jobs and brings together the support services the jobseeker needs to remain employed in the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's budget provides funding for early access to rehabilitation for veterans. Doing such is good for veterans and their families. However, in the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2016, otherwise known as DRCA, the government omitted the provision of minimising the duration and severity of injuries to employees by arranging quickly for the rehabilitation. When it comes to veterans' rehabilitation, the government is inconsistent with what it is budgeting for and what it is offering veterans under veterans' entitlements law. When DRCA comes up in the Senate, I will be moving an amendment to restore the provision of arranging quickly for rehabilitation so as to accord with what the government has actually budgeted for. The quick rehabilitation of our veterans, who have made enormous sacrifices to defend our freedoms, is the key to a successful recovery. Supporting veterans exposed to atomic bomb testing with a gold card in this budget has been 60 long years overdue—better late than never. But the government budget fails to provide funding for the children of those veterans exposed to radiation involved in the British nuclear testing and the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Some of the children of these veterans have experienced serious health issues and have no support from the government. This is shameful and should be reconciled this year as a matter of priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's continued commitment, in this budget, to funding pilot programs on suicide prevention is most welcome. The government needs to follow through with implementation of pilot programs, given its funding commitments. I note that last year the government made commitments for a rollout of a pilot program. It took seven-plus months for it to be instituted. In this regard, prior to making public announcements, the government should have a blueprint of any pilot program that is ready to go and should have its funding commitments guaranteed. Veterans do not need to be misled or experience broken or delayed promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note this budget is void of any funding to support those who have experienced side effects with mefloquine and other antimalarial drugs. This important health issue is being addressed by our allies as we in Australia lag behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The modernisation of computers within DVA in this budget will be the key to streamlining veterans' claims processes—we hope, anyway. I will be following DVA's information and communications technology upgrades very closely to insure best possible outcomes for our veterans. Cutting over $170 million through changes to veterans' healthcare arrangements in this budget may serve to negatively affect healthcare services to veterans. Thus far, the government has failed to adequately explain that cut. Nor has the government assured the veterans community that this budget measure will not disadvantage veterans in their healthcare needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of measures in this budget that I am pleased with but, before the Liberal government gives themselves a pat on the back, this budget is the bare minimum. Many of the measures are nothing but a change of mind—a reversal of cuts and a commitment to make no more cuts. It is the very least this government could do to support the Australian public. It is a budget that lacks vision and much-needed reform. I will not be smoking a cigar. Jobs and growth never took off. Exciting times were short and sweet. The 2017 budget is anything but fair. I think the opportunities for the LNP have taken a detour, and the only question still unanswered is: is the PM's job secure?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's nothing fair about making middle class and working class Australians pay more, while millionaires and multinationals pay less.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">And the great irony of this budget is that while it doesn't measure up to Labor's values – it doesn't keep faith with traditional Coalition values either: </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's a budget of big government, higher tax and more debt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, it's a budget devoid of values altogether. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our kids deserve nothing less. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's why tonight we can promise a Labor Government will restore every single dollar of the $22 billion the Liberals have cut from schools – right down to every last cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Better schools, better results and great teachers – properly paid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And tonight, Labor can confirm we will oppose the Liberals' cuts to universities, the increase in student fees, and the change in the repayment threshold that hits women, Indigenous Australians and low-paid the hardest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will never cheat smart, hard-working young and mature-age Australians out of the chance to get a degree. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Because we believe a university education is an opportunity that is earned – not a privilege that is inherited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When Mr Shorten and his brother were growing up, their mum and dad always told them that we could choose to learn a trade or go to uni – and they would support them either way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not a surprise perhaps, considering they were raised by a teacher and a fitter-and-turner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As prime minister – Mr Shorten will give that same promise to young Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Whether they choose university, TAFE or an apprenticeship – under Labor, the government of Australia will give them every chance to be their best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This begins with a new focus on training Australians, instead of importing skills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So far, all the Government has done about exploitation and rorts in the work visa system is re-name 457s visas, and yell at the Opposition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Their much-hyped changes only affect 8 per cent of visa holders. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Labor congratulates the Prime Minister for getting tough on foreign antique dealers and foreign goat farmers, but we need a lot more than that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's why Labor will train more nurses, cooks, carpenters, carers and electricians here at home – and help them fill the jobs we know our country needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And here's a free tip for a government looking for a policy – workers will believe they are fair dinkum about stopping visa rorts when they have independent labour market testing. Otherwise don't bother wasting their time, they're busy working</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In their past three budgets, the Liberals cut $2.8 billion out of training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On Tuesday night, they cut another $600 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A Labor government will reverse the Government's new cuts to TAFE and training. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And we will reverse the trend toward privatisation – because it's time to put public TAFE back at the centre of our national training system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Tonight, Labor pledges that in government, we will allocate 2 out of every 3 dollars raised of public vocational education funding to public TAFE. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After years of Liberal neglect, campuses in our regions and outer suburbs have fallen into disrepair, some have even closed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This means local people can't access the courses they need, in the communities where they live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's why Labor will create a new $100 million Building TAFE for the Future Fund, to renovate the classrooms, the workshops, the kitchens and the ag science centres. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We'll deliver world-class facilities, for a world-class training system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And this rebuilding work will begin where it's needed most – in areas of high youth unemployment around the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Rebuilding TAFE goes hand-in-hand with backing apprentices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's why a Labor Government will make a new rule, the one-in-10 rule.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For major infrastructure projects funded by the Commonwealth – 1 out of every 10 people employed must be an Australian apprentice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That means when we invest in public transport for our cities, on projects such as Cross-River Rail in Brisbane, Western Sydney Rail Link, Melbourne Metro, ADELINK and Perth METRONET.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When we back good local projects like the third crossing over the Shoalhaven in Nowra or better water security for Townsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When we make sure Victoria gets the fair share of funding it deserves.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When we modernise and build our energy network – with new pipelines and updated interconnectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And when we develop the North – through tourism infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We'll also be investing every time in Australian jobs and apprentices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Labor will hire Australian and we'll buy Australian too, maximising local content and Australian steel in our infrastructure and delivering Australian gas, first priority, to support blue-collar jobs in manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There was a time when the public sector was one of the biggest employers of apprentices. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But contracting-out and privatisation have undermined this. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">To turn this around, Labor will apply our new 1 in 10 rule to Government-Business Enterprises like the National Broadband Network, defence procurement and the Australian Rail Track Corporation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Like many members of Parliament, Mr Shorten has seen the pride that comes from wearing the ranger uniform, people working for this country on their country and their waters. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">A Labor government will set the example on job creation but we're going to need help from business too. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What they mean is better days for millionaires and multinationals, better days for property investors and tax-minimisers, better days for the big end of town, but bad news for battlers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister has said this budget is about 'helping Australians realise their dreams'. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unless they are a working class kid, who dreams of going to university; or a small business owner, dreaming of a proper NBN; or a young couple who dreams of owning their first home. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This Prime Minister of many words has learned a new one – fairness – and he's saying it as often as he can. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But repetition is no substitute for conviction. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's only one party this Parliament that believes in fairness - and delivers it: fair funding for education; fair protection for Medicare and the safety net; a fair deal for Australians with disability; a fair chance at a job – and a fair wage at work, including penalty rates; a fair start in the housing market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And a fair deal for the generation that follows us through taking action on climate change, equal pay for women, tackling inequality, closing the gap.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:26</span>):  I rise tonight to respond to a very clumsy, lacklustre and impotent attempt by a colleague in this place today to cast aspersions on the good work and character of another politician in this parliament. The speech delivered can only be characterised as a clumsy and juvenile attempt—and will only be remembered as being delivered by a desperate individual, a failed politician himself—to damage the outstanding credentials of the federal member for Capricornia, the truly outstanding coalition warrior, Michelle Landry. It is a matter of public record that Michelle Landry and her parliamentary colleague Luke Howarth, the member for Petrie, are credited with delivering the Turnbull coalition government to office. So that makes this attempt by a colleague in this chamber, Senator Watt, even grubbier, in my view. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Senator Watt claimed in his speech earlier today that Capricornia MP Michelle Landry is 'arguably the biggest failure in the House of Representatives'. Before we get on to Michelle Landry's performance as the member for Capricornia, let's just take a couple of minutes to compare the records of these two politicians. In the case of Senator Watts, except for a short period of time, he has been nestled in the breast of the public purse for his entire adult life. His first failure came when he took on the job as the chief of staff to Premier Bligh—and we all know what happened there. It resulted in the most catastrophic Labor loss in the history of this nation—losing 40 seats in my home state of Queensland. What contribution did Senator Watts make to that? Well, he actually had to lift heavier than any of his colleagues in his attempt to enter the parliament. He was successful in the seat of Everton, but he took a 9.2 per cent hit to the holding of that seat—the biggest in that election. Then, of course, not satisfied with his failure there, he went on to lose the seat for the first time in 40 years. The seat was held for 40 years by Labor, and he took another hit of 14.5 per cent. He took it from being one of Labor's safest seats in the state of Queensland and handed it over to us. It is now one of the safest seats we hold. This is the legacy of Watts. What did he do then? He had to find a way to make his way into this place. This is a man who in this place often champions the support of Labor in the regions. He even said so to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mercury</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think it's important Labor geographically spreads, that's why I'm setting up my office on the Gold Coast.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can get a light rail ride for $6.70 to the Gold Coast. It is hardly regarded as the regions and certainly not a region like that represented by the great Michelle Landry. What did he do? How did he make his way back? Labor had, accidentally, only one senator in the state of Queensland in the regions, and that was Jan McLucas in the seat of Cairns. You have heard me say in this place that poor Jan threw her legs over the side of the bed one day and sat up and looked down and her head was still on the pillow, because Labor took it off and replaced her with Senator Watts. Dear, oh, dear! I do not know even where to start. Before you lose the recent memory of Senator Watts's performance as a failed politician, let's have a look at Michelle Landry. What did she do?</span>

                  </a>  Knocking the 's' off means that there is not more than one of them—so Senator Watt. What we have now is Michelle Landry. She wrested the seat of Capricornia out of the grasp of Labor. It is one of the crown seats of the Labor movement. Do you know how Labor is? It is Labor that left a convicted paedophile as the member for the state seat embedded in Capricornia. He got elected. And then they went on to make him the opposition leader. This is how Labor in this area is. She took it off them not once but twice. For the first time in 50 years, this woman held that seat and returned it into our government twice. They were still riding horses around the main street of Rockhampton when that was last done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In case I run out of time—because this is going to take me a couple of hours to get through, but I am sure there will be further opportunities for me to finish—let's have a look: this woman has delivered into the region of Central Queensland in the seat of Capricornia $550 million worth of funding. It is on the public record and in the budget papers. What has Senator Watt put into the place? That would be zero. She got $166 million to fix the Eton range, $38 million to replace five country bridges near Mackay and Isaac, $1.1 million for Mackay Regional Council in funding to fix the intersection of Horse and Jockey Road and $8.5 million to engineer two overtaking lanes. Let me take a breath. She got $7.9 million for the new north- and south-bound overtaking lanes on the Bruce Highway, $190 million for future defence infrastructure for Capricornia, $10 million for the Yeppoon beachfront, $7 million for Rockhampton riverbank precinct and $2.3 million for the Capricorn rescue chopper. How many things has Senator Watt delivered for the seat of Capricornia? That would be none. And, just as we are attempting—and Michelle Landry is leading the charge—to put the Adani mine into Central Queensland, he voted in this place, along with his Queensland Senate colleagues, to knock it on the head. He voted to close coalmining in Queensland. He was not satisfied that, when he worked for Bligh as her chief of staff, they eroded 14,000 jobs from this part of the world that Michelle Landry is reinstating with this phenomenal effort that she has done to bring funding into the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $2.3 million for the Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service. That'll be there for Senator Watt when he needs to be rescued at the next election! There is $136 million to floodproof Bruce Highway in Rockhampton. There is $300,000 to Meals on Wheels when he is next unemployed, because it will only be a matter of time. There is $3 million for 16 Green Army projects and $2.7 million for Beef Australia. Given the time, I have no capacity to get through the pages and pages articulating this $550 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bloke who should have given this some thought. He did not even need to go around and get the library to do some of this; he can Google most of this. He should have given this some thought before he made this attack on this woman. I promise him this: he can come in here as frequently as he likes to attack my colleague and the colleague of the Nationals and the coalition. He can come in here every day. For every five minutes he does, I will do 10, and I have not even started on him. This was a grubby speech. It needs to be stopped. If he wants to take it, he can take it outside. If he wants to fight us, I will go with him up into Central Queensland. I made the offer to Labor today. I will take him into the public bar of the Black Nugget Hotel, and he can tell them what he has done and what he is doing for their jobs in Central Queensland. I tell you what: Michelle Landry is in and out of there all the time. She is much respected and much respected to win a Labor seat and then hold it for the first time in 50 years. For her to be maligned by a man who has failed at every political effort he has made since he came onto the public teat some 15 years ago is, I think, a grubby attempt. He should be ashamed of himself. It was a clumsy effort. It was a juvenile effort. He needs to be encouraged not to do it again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:36</span>):  What an absolute failure this federal budget has been for working people across all of Queensland. In this budget we see tax cuts for the wealthy, tax cuts for multinationals, a tax hike for working people and devastating cuts to our schools. Mr Turnbull sent us to the hustings for two long months last year, promising jobs and growth. He fielded candidates all over Queensland, making hollow promises to invest in our great state, lifting the hopes of Queensland voters that our state would finally be offered more support than was offered in the Abbott-Hockey era. He has monumentally failed to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead the Prime Minister has delivered a tax cut for millionaires and a tax hike for working Queenslanders. Residents of Point Piper and Toorak earning $1 million get a $16,000 tax cut. Queenslanders earning $65,000 get a $325 tax hike. Mr Turnbull has replaced the two per cent debt levy on incomes over $180,000 with an extra half a per cent tax hike for everyone, shunting the tax burden back onto low- and middle-income earners. There is a commitment to think about the Cross River Rail but not to deliver it. There is a promise to fully fund Medicare, but the Turnbull government is keeping the freeze across the health system for years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How did it get to this? The LNP has 21 of the 30 House of Representatives seats in federal parliament, but not one of them is up to the job of getting our state its fair share. Not one federal LNP member was prepared to stand up to their mates and stick their neck out for Queensland. As a result, Queenslanders are being hit with higher taxes and cuts to education for nothing in return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that loves to pretend it is helping Queenslanders. Take, for example, their failed decentralisation plan. There is no money for it in the budget. This absence of any funding for the LNP's decentralisation idea in the budget confirms my suspicion that it was nothing more than pub talk. The member for Flynn, Mr O'Dowd; the member for Capricornia, Ms Landry; and the member for Dawson, Mr Christensen, peddled this nonsense. They blindly followed the Deputy Prime Minister into the abyss of promoting his pork-barrelling. They talk about being fiscally responsible, yet they do not hold the Deputy Prime Minister for the money he spends on his own pet projects, and these projects remain on the never-never. They are fake promises with no purpose. They are absolutely shameful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government budget has proved once again that they do not care about regional Queensland. Furthermore, LNP Central Queensland MPs have failed to deliver long-promised job packages time and time again. This failure to secure funding for Central Queensland is a broken election promise. The LNP's much touted regional jobs and investment package has not delivered one job. Not one dollar has been spent, not one brick has been laid and not one business has been boosted. According to the government's own budget, the unemployment rate and the jobs growth rate hardly change over the forward estimates. If the government is serious about jobs and growth, we should see the numbers in the budget. Yet again, all talk and no jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years after the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility was announced, Mr Turnbull has failed to invest a single dollar from the NAIF while investing billions into new infrastructure for places like Sydney and Melbourne. This is a budget for millionaires in the south who get the $16,400 tax cut while Queenslanders get the tax hike. Mr Turnbull announced he might spend billions buying the Snowy hydro scheme from Victoria and New South Wales, but has not spent a cent on hydro power for North Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast Labor has announced that, if elected, it would deliver: $200 million for hydro power and $100 million for Townsville's water security, $25 million to build the south Rockhampton flood levy and $80 million for the Port of Gladstone access road. The only money in the budget for Queensland jobs is money that Mr Turnbull announced last year but has not been bothered spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget fails the jobs test; unemployment is going up. It fails the fairness test, with Queenslanders being left behind to pay for big projects elsewhere. And do not get me started on the zombie measures. Some of them are still there. They have not gone anywhere at all. The budget includes unfair zombie measures and new hidden nasties such as: keeping the age pension age at 70—the highest in the developed world; new cuts to family payments; new cuts to veterans' health; and the abolition of the energy supplement, which will leave pensioners up to $366 a year worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government has finally removed some other unfair zombie measures from the budget, everyone knows it will bring those savage cuts back as soon as it gets the chance. Temporarily removing these cuts are only about one thing: saving Mr Turnbull's job. They have changed their tactics, they have changed their rhetoric, but they will never change their minds. This budget is not fair. This budget is not what commentators are calling 'Labor lite'. A Labor budget would not hurt families, pensioners and schools to give millionaires and big business a tax handout. Queenslanders can never trust Mr Turnbull to deliver a fair and honest budget. That is because he does not believe it; his party does not believe it. The Treasurer says this is not a budget he wanted to deliver. It is a budget designed to save Mr Turnbull's job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this brings me to my last point: the bank levy. Queenslanders will not be fooled by this. Mr Turnbull is a friend of the banks. He is colluding with them to stop a royal commission that would end the rorts and rip-offs. We will not oppose the levy for big banks. The big banks are already getting a massive tax cut. The banks are already threatening to increase fees, and Mr Morrison says they should not. But what safeguards is he putting in place to stop $6 billion in new fees? Why is the ACCC only funded for a single year to protect consumers? Any new fees and charges will be the fault of Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison. Queenslanders can expect this government to monumentally fail to deliver. We can expect their regional jobs packages to never be actioned. We can expect their mobile phone towers to never be built. And we can expect their cruel and harsh cuts to return. Thank you.</span>
