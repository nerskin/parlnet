                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011 is primarily about ensuring that the subsidies and grants given to victims of the floods and Cyclone Yasi are tax deductible, and the coalition of course supports the tax deductibility of these subsidies and grants for people who suffered such a terrible start to 2011. We are debating this bill on the day that this government is going to deliver its next budgetâ€”the fourth Labor budget, the fourth deficit budget, the fourth budget that no doubt in the great Labor tradition will deliver more wasteful spending, more taxes, more debt and yet another deficitâ€”and of course the government will again use the floods and the cyclones as excuses for the budget being in such a disastrous position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Floods, cyclones and bushfires are a sad part of the Australian reality. Good governÂ­ments ensure that the budget and the economy are resilient enough to be able to deal with these sorts of tragedies if and when they occur, because as sure as night follows day they will occur, and a good government budgets for those sorts of contingencies. But this government has so mismanaged our public finances and so mismanaged the budget that there is no flexibility in the budget anymore. There is no resilience at all and we are now of course in a situation where, as a result of Labor's waste, misÂ­management and reckless spending, our budget is already in record deficit territory yet again for this financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government for the last couple of weeks has been talking about how this is going to be a tough budget. Yet over the last five months, the budget deficit for this financial year alone has blown out by another $8Â½ billion. Five months ago when the government released the MYEFO, the deficit was going to be $41.5 billion. Now we are being told that it is going to be more than $50 billion. Next year's budget is going to blow out by more than $8 billion and last year we were told that the deficit would be about $12 billion plus and it now looks as if it is going to be more than $20 billion. There is no suggestion that the government is in any way, shape or form capable of ever delivering a tough budget. I draw to the attention of the chamber that, as we speak, the government is borrowing $135 million every day to fund the deficit for this financial year. When we have a cyclone or when we have a flood, like we had earlier this year, the government cannot help itself but go for yet another ad hoc tax grabâ€”which was the $1.8 billion increase in income tax, also known as the flood tax. So here we are: it is borrowing $135 million every day. Next year the government will spend $6 billion on interest payments to service the debt that it has now accumulated. Six billion dollars worth of interest payments! Just imagine how much a prudent government, how much a good government, how much a government that spends taxpayers' money wisely, could do with $6 billion. That is six world-class public hospitals. Just imagine how many roads or how much infrastructure could be built. Imagine how much could be done in the reconstruction effort in Queensland if the government had not mismanaged the finances to the extent that it has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wayne Swan talks about the budget tonight as a tough budget. As I have already mentioned, this is not going to be a tough budget. I noted the description of the budget by Senator Wong earlier this week. I think it was in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>. Senator Wong said that this will be 'a Labor budget'. I took that as being a bit of a threat to the Australian peopleâ€”that the budget tonight is going to be a Labor budget. If it is going to be a Labor budget, we sure know that it is going to be a budget full of wasteful spending, full of more taxes, full of higher deficits and more debt, and full of ideological attacks on those Australians who are not seen to be part of the Australian Labor Party voter support base. It will be a tax on those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own health care by taking out private health insurance. These are the sorts of things, no doubt, that we are going to see in a good old-fashioned Labor budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are, in a circumstance where we have a budget that is an absolute mess. This is, of course, a very bad tradition of the Labor Party. This will be the ninth conÂ­secutive deficit budget of a federal Labor government. It will be the fourth consecutive deficit budget of this Labor governmentâ€”four out of four. Of course, there were five consecutive deficit budgets under the previous federal Labor administration. So deficit budgets are part of Labor's DNA. Mismanaging the economy, mismanaging our public finances, is part of Labor's DNA. People across Australia know that, whatever happens, the Labor Party in government messes things up and it is the coalition that has to come in and fix it, through a sound approach to better financial management and by restoring good government. Labor always talks tough before a budget and then goes on to deliver yet another deficit. Labor does not know how to live within its means. This is no doubt going to be the way it is going to play out yet again tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of this legislation is an attempted fix of another Labor Party stuff-up. Remember the First Home Saver Accounts, which the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, announced back in 2008 with much fanfare? We were told as part of the budget then that the First Home Saver Accounts initiative would see 730,000 home saver accounts opened over four years. Just 24,000 people have taken it up because it is such a low-value offering, due to the way it was structured by the government back in 2008. This bill will make some changes which will make the offering slightly more attractive. In particular, the changes that will be made by this bill will allow savings to be paid into a mortgage at the end of the minimum qualifying period rather than requiring them to be transferred to a superannuation or retirement savings account. We support that change, but we make the point again that the government do not know how to manage any program competently. They do not think things through before they press ahead. Wherever you look there is failure, waste, mismanagement and incompetence. There is weakness, there is indecisiveness and there is budget mismanagement. So this is yet another fix for what was an example of Labor Party incompetence in Wayne Swan's first budget. With those few remarks, on behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we will be supporting this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I also want to make a few remarks on that part of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011 that deals with making exempt from income tax the disaster income recovery subsidy payments made to victims of the recent floods and Cyclone Yasi. Both events were traumatic for those involved and there was loss of life in both instances. Regrettably, both happened in my home state of Queensland. I want to emphasise to anyone who might be listening to this debate that, whilst there were those disasters, they are a matter of courseâ€”that is, nature occurring. Indeed, Queensland is open for business and always has been. We know how to deal with cyclones, particularly in the north. They cause great trauma to those directly involved, but for the rest of the North Queensland area life continues as usual. Holiday destinations along the north coast of Queensland are certainly open and very welcoming to people around Australia, and indeed the world, who may want to experience a great holiday in the North Queensland sunshine as we approach the southern winter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wish to address the aspect of the bill where recovery subsidy payments are made to victims. I think it is appropriate that they are exempt from income tax. This has always been something that various governments have looked at. I think the Howard governÂ­ment set the scene some years ago when it declared tax exemption for payments to victims of a cyclone in Western Australia whose name I cannot recall. I think that was the first instance when the Howard governÂ­ment dealt with this particular problem that arises from disaster subsidy payments and set the scene for subsequent governments to follow and apply income tax relief to these payments. While I am on my feet I also want to congratulate the Greens political party for their support of legislation which effectively provided a tax on all Australians to assist with the flood recovery in my state of QueensÂ­land and elsewhere but which imposed its burden only on individual taxÂ­payers and not upon those companies that the Greens are always railing againstâ€”those multinational mining companies that are ripping the lifeblood out of Australia. That, I mention for the benefit of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, is a summary of the approach the Greens political party have always made. They always look at these international investors in Australia and say how awful it is that they are digging up Australia and exporting the profits overseas. It amazes me then why the Greens supported the Labor Party in imposing a flood tax on individuals but allowed those multinational profit-taking companies, that the Greens are always so keen to talk about, to be exempt from any payment of that flood tax which would go towards recovery in Queensland and elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I simply cannot understand, with all the rhetoric you hear from the Greens as we approach the budget on how we need to increase taxes on these mining companies and other international companies, why they exempted those very same companies from the flood levy, from the flood tax. If the Greens were genuineâ€”and you know my view on that I do not think the Greens are genuine about too much at all except personal publicity and promotion of their ultra left-wing agenda within the Australian political sceneâ€”one would wonder why they would tax Australian individuals but let off all of those companies which make substanÂ­tial profits in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to rehash the debate on the flood levy but I always thought that rather than having a flood levy it would have been better to take the money needed for the recovery from cyclones and floods from the general revenue in which case companies would pay company tax towards it, the extra wealthy would pay a higher level of contribution towards it and those with lower incomes would barely contribute at all. That is appropriate in a nation with a progressive tax system. But no, the Greens did not support that. The Labor Party and the Greens, the alliance, got together and taxed individual Australians but let companies go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been brought home to me as I have toured the cyclone devastated parts of North Queensland that the local butcher and the local baker are paying the flood recovery tax but Woolworths and Coles, their competitors in the bread and meat markets, are not paying a cent towards the flood recovery levy. How could the so-called party of the worker, the Labor Party, and the Greens, who are so keen on their left-wing agenda, possibly penalise local small businesses in North Queensland and indeed elsewhere by imposing a flood tax on them but exempt Coles and Woolworths, who compete with them in their businesses?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we approach the budget tonight you will find a lot more of that sort of hypocrisy coming from the Greens. I say to the Greens: good on you. You are supporting a governÂ­ment that believes in the Pacific solution. I thought the Greens were opposed to the Pacific solution for boat people who come here without permission. I thought they were violently opposed to that and yet here they are supporting a government which is now havingâ€”</span>

What confidence can anyone have in the Greens? I just cannot wait until the new Senate starts and we have Senator elect Rhiannon in the Greens little group here. Unfortunately you do not bet, Senator Xenophon, but I would not mind betting that she will be making a leadership bid very soon after she gets here and who would discourage her from attempting to do that and give a bit of real exposure to the Greens as to what they really stand for. I do not think Senator elect Rhiannon tries to hide where she is coming from, where she is going to or what her goals are, and that might be a refreshing change even if it is a change that is totally abhorrent to particularly those of us on this side of the chamber.</span>

                    </a>  You have anticipated me wonderfully, Mr Acting Deputy President. The next words to come out of my mouth were to be: 'But I think I have strayed a little from the debate before the chamber on the exemption from income tax of disaster income recovery subsidy payments.' I will conclude my remarks; I do not want to delay the chamber. I will simply say that with the victims of Cyclone Yasi this sort of legislation is well received. It is certainly supported by the coalition and, as I say, it follows an initiative started by the Howard government some time ago. There are anxieties, if I might put it that way, with the recovery effort. I was told recently that the number of suicides in the town of Tully, which was one of the towns that received the direct brunt of Cyclone Yasi, have increased. That in itself is a tragedy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know a lot of small businesses in Mission Beach, Cardwell and Tully will not reopen. People had put their life savings into small businesses in those areas affected by the cyclone. In terms of being able to take advantage of the generosity of other Australians in making voluntary donations to various appeals and also of the Australian people as a whole through the flood taxâ€”not Australian companies, I might add, but Australian people who will be contributing through the flood taxâ€”the way that has been administered is causing some real concern and the rules relating to that have also caused some anxiety. I think it is not the time today or on this bill to go into that. Suffice to say that, as with so many things with the Labor Party at both federal and state level, the idea is good and the principle is correct but the administration of those relief schemes leaves a lot to be desired. Never is sufficient thought given to them. Never is sufficient thought paid to the importance of small business in those areas and of the small business people who create the jobs in all parts of Australia but particularly in regional Australia. As I say, I am distressed to hear that a number of them will not reopen their doors. But insofar as this legislation is concerned, as Senator Cormann has said, the coalition support the exemption from income tax of those subsidy payments and we urge support for this bill.</span>

                    </a>  I indicate my support for this legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011. It seeks to implement the recent disaster related initiatives and changes to Australia's tax laws. My principal concern that I explored at the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the flood levy legislation was for those individuals who have suffered from lesser-known disasters, such as the Stockport floods in South Australia, who have also lost their homes and whether they would be liable to the levy. I am satisfied with the response I have received from the government that those areas of South Australia that have been the subject of a declaration made under the NDRRA, the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, so long as one of the following conditions were satisfied: whether an individual was seriously injured; an Australian was killed, and that Australian was an immediate family member of the individual; or the individual's principal place of residence was destroyed or sustained major damage; or the individual was unable to gain access to their principal place of residence for at least 24 hours; or they were stranded in their principal place of residence for at least 24-hours. They would be fully coveredâ€”in other words, they would not be subject to any income tax levy. They would need to apply for that, so there is an administrative process, but they would clearly be eligible to be exempt from any levy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that in my home state there were floods in Stockport, Riverton and Rhynie areas in early December 2010. There were also floods in the Barossa Valley in February 2011 which affected Eudunda, Swan Reach, Nuriootpa, Kapunda, Tanunda, Stockwell and Ebenezer. For the Clare and Gilbert Valleys Council the damages bill was in the order of $15 million. The Regional Council of Goyder had a damages bill of $10 million, the District Council of Peterborough had a damages bill of $2 million and as well there were damages for councils in Orroroo, Carrington and the Flinders Ranges and for the Northern Areas Council. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements cover those individuals and businesses that have been affected and I think it is entirely appropriate in the context of the administrative arrangeÂ­ments in this bill. Therefore, I indicate my support for the government's bill as being necessary administrative arrangements to the tax act to implement the effect of the flood levy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 to this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011, amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the disaster income recovery subsidy payments to victims of the recent disasters that devastated parts of Australia during the 2010-11 summer. The amendÂ­ments also exempt from income tax ex gratia payments made to certain New Zealand visa holders affected by the disaster in 2010-11 where the Australian government disaster recovery payment has been activated. Exempting these disaster relief payments from income tax is consistent with the govÂ­ernment's response to other disasters such as the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoriaâ€”your home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshallâ€”and alleviates the financial hardship being felt in affected communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 exempts from income tax category C payments made under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements for small businesses and primary producers affected by the 2010-11 floods and Cyclone Yasi. This measure recognises the hardship suffered by small businesses and primary producers in affected areas and provides certainty for recipients in terms of tax treatment at a time when they should not need to worry about tax matters. Schedule 3 increases the flexibility of the first home saver accounts. Individuals who purchase a home before meeting the minimum release conditions will now be able to put the money towards their new home. This change amends the tax laws to allow money in a first home saver account to be paid to a genuine mortgage, after the end of a minimum qualifying period, should the account holder purchase a dwelling in the interim. Currently, this money would go towards their superannuation balance. First home saver accounts are designed to encourage individuals, through tax concessions and government contributions, to save for their first home over the medium to long term and have been available since October 2008. This measure applies to houses purchased after the bill's royal assent. The bill deserves the support of parliament and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  I am delighted to speak to this bill on behalf of the opposition because, as I think you know, very few things excite me more than legislation concerning personal property securities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes some minor and technical amendments to the personal property secÂ­urities regime, which was introduced by the government, with coalition support, in 2009 and which comes into effect later this year. The regime rationalises the current CommonÂ­wealth, state and territory laws on securities over personal property to create one national and consistent set of rules and a single, national online register. It establishes one comprehensive law and thereby removes the doubts and confusions of at times inconsistent regimes between the various states and territories as had heretofore been the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The personal property securities legislation arises from an Australian Law Reform Commission reference as long ago as 1990. The matter was pursued through COAG, which in 2007 endorsed the national system. The former Attorney-General the Hon. Philip Ruddock gave this issue particular priority. In October 2008 COAG signed an intergovernmental agreement to effect the proposed legislation as part of the Seamless National Economy agreement among the Commonwealth, states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments proposed by this bill in particular clarify that the regime does not affect a secured party's capacity to appoint or veto the appointment of a company administrator under a transitional security agreement, confirm that the rights and liabilities of receivers and administrators in respect of pre-appointment transactions are unchanged, ensure access to third-party data for consumer protection purposes and prevent access to the register for the purpose of sale of the data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also some technical amendments in respect of the powers of the registrar and to deal with accession to the regime by states which have not yet adopted the relevant version of the PPS scheme as amended in 2010 and by this bill. These amendments were recommended by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report on the 2010 amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, the coalition has always supported the implementation of the PPS regimeâ€”indeed, this area of law reform was largely driven by former Attorney-General Mr Ruddockâ€”and therefore is pleased to indicate its support for this bill.</span>

The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulatory Levies (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 contains amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. These amendments will enable NOPSA, which is funded on a cost recovery basis with levies raised from the offshore petroleum industry, to collect levies to recover costs associated with undertaking its augmented integrity and well-related regulatory functions. As NOPSA is funded on a cost recovery basis, levies imposed by the Safety Levies Act are required for NOPSA to carry out its functions and responsibilities. Current levies imposed by the Safety Levies Act are not appropriate in terms of both their purpose and the entity from which they are collectable. These bills will ensure that NOPSA is able to collect levies relating to its augmented well-related functions from the correct entity, which in this case is the title holder.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010, although I must note that, in the explanatory memorandum circulated by Minister Macklin some time ago, she suggests that the financial impact of this bill in the year 2010-11 will be $0.4 million, with other financial impacts decreasÂ­ing as the years go on. That is $0.4 million the government has saved by delaying the introduction of this bill until now. In 2008, the then Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquired into this bill, and in May 2009 the government came back with its response to the bill. So, two years on, we are now looking at putting into effect the government's reaction to the committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must disclose that I was a member of the ministerial advisory group that was set up by former senator the Hon. Dr Kay Patterson to establish the legislative framework around the special disability trusts some years ago. It was thought then that about 5,000 special disability trusts would be set up over the next four years, and the budget for it was predicated on that fact. The majority of the members of that ministerial advisory group were parents of people with disabilities. While there was great enthusiasm for this development, there was also concern put to us by departmental and other groups that we needed to be sure that we did not break the budget with what was at the time a very revolutionary idea: providing extra funds to assist with the long-term care and support of people with disabilities. So, in the end, the legislation that went through erred on the side of caution. Unfortunately, as a result, only 119 special disability trusts had been taken up as at the end of last financial year, I think. Clearly, the bar had been set far too high and there were too many hoops to jump through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This billâ€”the government's response to the community affairs committee inquiryâ€”does change some of those criteria. It allows a lighter work test. It actually encourages people with disabilities to work, whether that is in the mainstream system or on a supÂ­ported wage, whereas under the previous criteria, if you were capable of working, you probably could not have a speciality disability trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My thinking on the specialty disability trust had always been that it was in a way analogous to superannuation. We provide pensions for older people who cannot provide for themselves. We have never had a system that allowed people with a disability to do anything other than be on a pension. This system allows those with the capacity to do so to set up trusts for the long-term care and support of their relative with a disabilityâ€”normally a child or grandchild. It means that these people, hopefully, have the chance to live the life of their choice, supported by their relatives. This has not happened in the past. We are talking about people with very little earning capacity of their own, with wages of perhaps $3 or $4 an hour, which never allows anyone the opportunity to develop superannuation. This would be a way to allow those people to proceed in an environment that protected their assets. So some of the moves that are in this bill well and truly relating to special disability trusts are very, very welcome. There are one or perhaps two that I found particularly disappointing, and one was the government's response to the committee's recommendations on home ownership. A special disability trust will continue to be able to own a residence which is the residence of the person who the trust is established for and just over an indexed half a million dollars of other assets. What the committee suggested was that the home owner's grant should be available for these houses within the trust. We also suggested that if the house was sold it should be exempt from capital gains tax. If you look at the position of any Australian citizen, they are entitled, when they buy their first house, to get the first home owners grant. They are entitled when they sell that primary residence to have it exempt from capital gains tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that people with disabilities do not buy and sell their own homes is that they have impaired decision-making capacity. That is the whole reason that you set up a special disability trustâ€”so that that person's income and assets are protected and looked after by people who can help them to make the decisions that need to be made. So, if you have a disability and impaired decision-making capacity as a result of that, you cannot take advantage of the same benefits that are available to any other Australian. The government refused our recommenÂ­dation that the first home owners grant be available for a house bought by a special disability trust. On the same basis, the government did not accede to our recomÂ­mendation that that house be exempt from capital gains tax when it is sold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I realise that what we have here is the butting up of trust legislation against disability legislation. Nevertheless, it would seem to me to be grossly unfair to say that, because a person has a disability, that means they cannot own a home in their own right, are subjected to extra capital gains tax and are not eligible for a grant that is available to any other Australian when they buy their first home. So I would urge the government to go on looking at ways to improve this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did also recommend that if the changes that were proposed by the comÂ­munity affairs committee inquiry into this bill did not see a larger uptake of special disability trusts then we review, yet again, what was wrong with our legislation that is preventing people from doing this. There were two recommendations that I would like the government to follow. The government agreed that, again, it should be reviewed if it does not lead to a bigger take-up of special disability trusts. We are two years down the track and, obviously, this has not yet happened, so it will have to be 2013 or so before we can even decide whether we need to change these regulations further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our other recommendation was that Centrelink be used to promote the existence of special disability trusts, and on that basis I was extremely disappointed to hear Queensland's Public Trustee on radio in Brisbane last week, when asked about what was available for providing for the future of people with disabilities, not actually mention special disability trusts. What he did mention was that there are some arrangements that the federal government is sort of working on now. What he meant was this piece of legislation that will assist in making it easier for parents and other relatives to come up with a system to support and look after the future of children with disabilities. But I would urge the government to very much use Centrelink and other groups to push for and promote these schemes. They are known about in some areas of the disability community. Unfortunately, what has happened is that people who have looked at the trust scheme, under the previous legislation, and found that it was not wide enough to allow them to establish trusts, have told others that the trusts are useless. So the changes that happen here must be promoted and promoted well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed that Minister McLucas smiled there. I did say earlier that there was a balance of caution, when this legislation was first introduced, between the cost of it and the useability of it. And clearlyâ€”and I do not think anyone would resile from the factâ€”we did not get the balance right. But it was a revolutionary change and it needs to be supported and continue to be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I would like to make is that this is just one of the building blocks that this government needs to look at in terms of the long-term care for and support of people with disabilities. We now have the draft of the national disability insurance scheme. In some ways, it overtakes some of the concerns that parents who could not afford to set up a special disability trust had, because one hopes we are going to get to a needs-based disability system that is actually a fair, well-funded system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is not just about the money. The money is only a very small part of what people need. I had a man with an acquired brain injury and a friend of his family and an advocate for disability services come to see me last week. This man lives alone in a flat with other tenants living around him. It is low rental. His money and his food are often stolen by other tenants because he simply does not have the ability to stop this happening. He has frequent falls because his leg muscles sometimes do not react as he would want them to because of the brain injury. He often ends up in hospital because of these frequent falls. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current response of our disability service system to this man is to give him three hours of assistance a day. Someone comes to cook his meals in the evening. He does not eat unless prompted to eat. This is part of his condition. He had lost a huge amount of weightâ€”in fact, he was possibly going to starve himself to deathâ€”yet it was not until a family friend and the advocate brought this to the attention of the Queensland Department of Communities that anything was done to assist him to make sure that he got meals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The family friend tells me that once he fell and broke his collarbone. He was taken by ambulance eventually to the local hospital and stayed there all day waiting for surgery on the broken collarbone. The surgery was cancelled at 6 pm and the hospital said to the family friend, who has no responsibility for this man whatsoever except that she appears to be one of the few people who cares about him, to take him home. She refused to do that. My point is that our system is not in any way conducive to helping people in those positions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not about money. It would not matter how much money this man had in the bank. He could probably live in a better flat, but without people who care about him around him to see whether the services he is getting are good services, poor services or adequate services his life is going to continue to be unhappy and frustrating. So it is not just about the money. I think we need to consider further not just this piece of legislationâ€”which assists by establishing trustees who will have a stronger interest than a state public trustee, for example, in the quality of life of the personâ€”but also the need for a system that incorporates developing planning options and planning services for people with disabilities so that when they no longer have family members or others who can care for them they are not left to the mercies of the disabilities system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we do all of this we have to take into account the need to have caring people and adequate services and services that are being advocated for by groups outside governmentâ€”disability service groups such as the one involved in this case, which is SUFY, a Queensland organisation called Speaking Up For You. We need that sort of support behind people to make sure that what is being provided is not only adequate, which in many cases it is not, but also meeting the real needs of people. I think it is about time we realised that by doing this we do not just save $0.4 million, which is what has happened here by delaying the introduction of this by over a year, but also all the on-costs of people becoming sick, mentally unwell, because they did not have a small input of support when they needed it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  The Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010 is a bit of a grab bag of miscelÂ­laneous measures with certain schedules in and then out, in and then out. However, I will limit my comments to those schedules that we are debating. The Greens particularly welcome the amendments to the special disability trusts, believing that this is a very important mechanism that enables parents of children with a disability to put in place proÂ­visions to make them feel more comfortable that their children will be looked after when they are no longer there. I have been particularly supportive of and continue to support special disability trusts. I was an active participant in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry that took place several years ago looking into them. Having said that, I am also aware that trusts are available only to a certain number of people and that we need to be putting in place, as Senator Boyce has just said, a range of other measures to ensure that those living with a disability are supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be supporting the amendments the government has put in place. They were raised very substantially through the committee inquiry and I think they will make the trusts much more usable for those that have established them and for those that intend to establish them. As Senator Boyce also highlighted, because of some of the barriers in the current legislation, people have not been setting up special disability trusts and we hope that these provisions will enable people to use that mechanism much more effectively and efficiently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, the government is aware that there is unfinished business on the trusts and more needs to be done. I know that in many states, particularly in my home state of Western Australia, there are people that are deeply concerned that they have already established accommodation for their son or daughter and are not able then to transfer that accommodation, those homes, into the trusts. I understand the government's nervousness about that and the belief that this would open up areas for other trusts. However, these people need our support. These people are trying to do the right thing and set up provisions to look after their son or daughter and we need to find a way to facilitate that. I for one will keep pushing until we do find a mechanism to transfer those homesâ€”because they are people's homesâ€”into the trusts. In Western Australia, parents are very worried that they are going to start hitting issues around asset tests et cetera. We believe more work needs to be done, so the government has a pass but 'can improve'. We look forward to the government's looking at some of those other issues to enable the special disability trust provisions to be as effective as possible. The Greens joined with many people, including the coalition, to express our concerns with the government's original provisions under schedule 2 of this legislation. We were concerned that the provisions that dealt with the issues of change in the portability of the DSP payments would adversely affect a number of people where carers have to travel overseas for work purposes, so we are pleased that the government has now circulated amendments to this. We had serious concerns about the ramifications of the changes to the portability arrangements for recipients, particularly of course for those who are caring for somebody with severe disability who is dependent on a family carer. We had submissions from carers who are required to reside overseas for long periods. As we know, that schedule was referred to the Senate Standing Committees on Community Affairs and there was a report tabled on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I am glad to see that the issues arising from that have been dealt with by the government. However, we do still have some concerns that there will be people whose carers need to travel overseas for other, very legitimate reasons and not necessarily just for paid work. For example, they may already be caring for somebody in Australia but have to travel overseas for extended periods to look after sick or elderly parents or to pursue higher education. We are glad to see that the amendments now refer to carers who are family members. We believe this has brought them into the definition of the guardianship orders and better recognises family care arrangements that can be complex and often fragile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just referred to the fact that some carers have to travel overseas for what we believe are other legitimate reasons and that they need to take the person who they care for with them. We understand that the government has acknowledged that they will review the operation of the new portability arrangements, starting no later than one year after the commencement of this section, and will include a report as to whether granting special consideration for work purposes is too restrictive and whether it would be appropriate to extend the qualifying circumÂ­stances to cover other extended absences from Australia for non-work related purposes such as caring for other family members. We thought this was a better approach than seeking to amend the government's amendment, because we want to see how that amendment operates, but we do think that there may be other legitimate circumÂ­stances that may penalise those caring for a family member with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other issues that came up during the committee inquiry was the sensitive issue of the definition around severe disability as it relates to working age provisions. This is a very touchy subject and a very important issue. One of the issues that people constantly raise with meâ€”and it was raised again in the inquiryâ€”is that of carers who are caring for someone with a lifelong, severe disability who receive forms every two years and have to continue to say, 'Yes, my son or daughter or the person I care for still has a severe disability.' I have described before how the system works in WA. There are adopt-a-pollie schemes, where politicians are 'adopted' by a family with a child living with disability. The family that I have been adopted by was sent a letter when the child attained driving age asking, 'Has he got his driver's licence?' This is about somebody with a severe and lifelong disability. That sort of letter can be seen to be very insensitive by families, as their child will never have any hope of being able to live unsupported, they need 24-hour care and they will never have any hope of obtaining a driver's licence. I think we can do better than that in Australia. Yes, we need to have checks and balances, but that sort of thing should not be happening and it has been raised with me a number of times and was raised during the committee inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will also be supporting schedule 2, subject to the government's amendment, and we are pleased that the government was responsive to the committee inquiry. It again shows the usefulness of committee inquiries in reviewing legislation. I have circulated amendments to schedule 4. Schedule 4 is no longer part of this particular bill. I just need to highlight that I will, of course, not be moving those previously circulated amendments to schedule 4.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McLUCAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I thank the various senators who have made contributions on this legislation. This bill introduces one 2010 budget measure and some other measures. As Senator Siewert indicated, it is an omnibus bill. The budget measure is to enhance the existing arrangements for special disability trusts. This is part of the government's ongoing commitment to people with disability and their families and carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Special disability trusts were established in 2006 under the former coalition government. Their purpose is to help families and carers provide for the care and accommodation needs of a family member with a severe disability. Special disability trusts are different from other types of trusts in that they have generous concessions from social security means testing arrangements for the beneficiary and eligible contributors. The effect for a person with a disability who is a beneficiary of a special disability trust is that the person will not lose any of their disability support pension unless their assets exceed a generous assets test threshold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs found, in its 2008 inquiry, that the take-up of these arrangeÂ­ments has been lower than expected. The arrangements were simply not working for people with disability, their families or their carers. The government responded to the committee's report through the 2010-11 budget with a number of changes to special disability trusts. More flexibility for trust beneficiaries will be provided to make special disability trusts more attractive to families. At present, if a person with a disability works for as little as one hour for the relevant minimum wage or above, they are not eligible to be a beneficiary of a special disability trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in this bill address that incentive for people with disability to participate in work and in the community. The changes will allow eligible people with a disability to work up to seven hours a week at or above the relevant minimum wage and still qualify as a beneficiary of a special disability trust. There will also be a significant expansion in the purposes that trust funds can be used for, such as all medical expenses, including membership costs for private health insurance funds and maintenance expenses of special disability trust properties. The trust will also be able to make up to $10,000 a year of discretionary spending for the beneficiary's wellbeing, recreation and independence. This change modifies the restrictive rules presently in place that trust funds can be used only for specified care and accommodation expenses and will increase the social participation of beneficiaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes contained in this bill build on the taxation concessions the government announced in the 2009-10 budget in response to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report. In a separate measure, the bill closes a loophole in qualification for disability support pension. This loophole has meant that disability support pension has continued to be paid to people who live permanently overseas but who return to Australia every 13 weeks to retain their pension. Under this bill, except under limited and specific circumstances, only disability support pensioners currently residing in Australia will continue to get the pension. Closing the loophole will bring disability support pension into line with other workforce age payments. It will also keep the disability support pension payment system fair and effective. If a pensioner has a need to travel overseas for short periods, he or she will still have access to the 13-week temporary absence rule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government amendments to this measure will include a delay of the commencement from 1 January to 1 July 2011 so there will be no retrospective adverse effect on those affected. The government amendments will also introduce from 1 July 2011 an extended portability period for severely disabled disability support pensioners to address concerns raised by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The extended portability will apply if the person accomÂ­modates a supporting family member who has been posted or seconded by their employer to work overseas for a period. Senator Siewert in her contribution raised other circumstances where a person with caring responsibilities may need to travel for reasons other than work. We undertake to conduct a review of the operations of the DSP portability measure after one year of operation to ascertain if there are circumÂ­stances which may need to be considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The eligibility for family tax benefit part A of some families with FTB children who are studying overseas full time will be clarified by this bill. If the courses these young people are undertaking do not link to an Australian qualification, it is not clear under the current legislation that they should attract family tax benefit part A. This bill puts that beneficial policy intention beyond doubt. It makes sure that young people studying overseas full time are treated for family tax benefit purposes in the same way as full-time students undertaking Australian study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further amendments in the bill are minor matters. In particular they address two minor anomalies arising from the pension reform legislation enacted in 2009. Both amendÂ­ments are to make sure people get the benefit of the new provisions that they were intenÂ­ded to have. Amendments made in the House withdrew from the bill the two schedules relating to the Indigenous Land Corporation and the scheduling of land. This withdrawal was purely for timing reasons: to allow a particular land measurement to be clarified and an inquiry into the Indigenous Land Corporation measure by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee to proceed without delaying the bill unduly. Those measures will be introÂ­duced in a future bill, and this current bill should proceed without them. I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I rise to speak on the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. This bill continues a program of reform that was initiated by the previous coalition government in 2004 when it created the Department of Human Services to place greater emphasis on the way government delivers services to Australians. This bill merges the back-end support services and some customer areas for Medicare and Centrelink, locating both within the Department of Human Services. The bill will achieve this through making amendments to the provisions of the Medicare Australia Act 1973 and the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997, which is more widely known as the Centrelink act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will abolish the statutory offices of the chief executive officer of Medicare Australia and the chief executive officer of Centrelink and create statutory offices of Chief Executive Medicare and Chief Executive Centrelink within the Department of Human Services. It will also abolish Medicare Australia and Centrelink as statutory agencies, and the existing functions that both of these agencies provide will be delivered by employees of the Department of Human Services in support of their chief executives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry into the legislation by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee did raise issues regarding privacy, and this bill brings in amendments to clarify the operation of program secrecy provisions after the restructure to ensure that there is substantially no change from previous arrangements with respect to the sharing of customer data. As a consequence, the bill will bring in new defined terms of 'Medicare programs' and 'Centrelink programs' to replace the current secrecy provisions which focus on the agencies as the basis for regulating information sharing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also amends the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to align the provisions for the appointment of the Child Support Registrar with the provisions for the appointment of Chief Executive Centrelink and Chief Executive Medicare. It also makes consequential amendments to a number of other acts that currently refer to the agencies or statutory authorities that will be abolished. The amendments to formalise the new structure of the Department of Human Services will be implemented on 1 July 2011 and transitional arrangements have been put in place to ensure no disruption in customer service delivery occurs consequent to these changes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also amends the investigative search and seizure provisions of part IID of the Medicare Australia Act. Many of these provisions were modelled on earlier versions of the corresponding provisions in the Crimes Act 1914. Because there have been amendments to the Crimes Act over time, some of the provisions in the Medicare Australia Act are no longer aligned with provisions in the Crimes Act. The main purpose of the proposed amendments to the investigative search and seizure provisions is to bring those provisions into closer alignment with the Crimes Act provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition believes in smaller and more streamlined government. This bill continues in that reforming tradition. This bill, which will consolidate the back-office operations of Medicare and Centrelink into a single department, should enhance service delivery from the perspective of the taxpayer with minimum change to the interaction of the clients of Centrelink or Medicare. Clearly, it is not the intention of the opposition to oppose this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I stand to speak in support of the Autonomous Sanctions Bill 2010. The opposition supports the broad thrust of this standalone piece of legislation, which gives the government the ability to impose sanctions regimes without resorting to sometimes confusing and often messy legislation and regulations, such as in banking, customs regulations and other legislation related to the provisions of services and/or software. As I said, this is a standalone piece of legislation that brings together the Commonwealth's power to impose a vital diplomatic tool on certain circumstances arising in the international public policy arena. It also imposes standard penalties for those who contravene the provisions of the legislation and is consistent with the rules applied to the enforcement of UN Security Council sanctions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should pause to say that sanctions, and autonomous sanctions as set out in this legislation, are not the solution to every international and diplomatic problem. They are a very useful tool, but of course there are often unintended consequences with respect to the innocent populations within countries against which sanctions are imposed where they are deprived of certain necessities and other goods that people in Australia may wish to export. By way of a brief history, Zimbabwe, North Korea, Burma, Iraq, the former Republic of Yugoslavia and Fiji have all been the subject of Australian autonomous sanctions. North Korea has been subject to sanctions since 2006. As far back as 1992, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was the subject of sanctions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, and speaking on behalf of the opposition, this is a useful diplomatic tool that is refined in this legislation and made more flexible and more effective. I pause to say that there have been some privacy concerns on the part of the opposition. The Senate committee resolved those to some extent. The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee went some long way towards setting out the problem and then indicated that it had been resolved in the legislation. I pause also to say that there appears to be no right of appeal or review with respect to an adjudication for exporters to countries that are the subject of sanction. The Defence Export Control Office is a classic example. An arbitrary decision by the Minister for Defence can inhibit the export of certain goods by Australian companies without them having any say or any right of review or appeal. That is a very unsatisfactory situation. I underline it simply to say that ministers need to engage much more with Australian industry on such matters. Having said all of that, I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

The 1999 act impleÂ­mented the UN Commission on International Trade Law, UNCITRAL, model law on electronic commerce of 1996. The intention of the model law is to provide a more secure environment for electronic commerce to remove legal obstacles to its acceptance. The principal effect of the act is to provide that transactions will not be invalid merely because they have been completed electÂ­ronically. Giving information in writing, providing a handwritten signature, producing a document in material form and recording or retaining information may all be done electronically.</span>

However, it makes no substantive change to the law of contract.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill applies the changes proposed by the convention in respect of international contracts. It provides default rules for determining the time of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications for the purÂ­poses of formation and performance of a contract. It also clarifies the traditional contractual rules on formation in the context of electronic commerce to recognise autoÂ­mated message systems. It clarifies rules about invitations to treat and determining the location of the parties and updates the electronic signature provisions. The conÂ­vention rules exclude personal, domestic or household contracts from its regime. However, the bill does not make any such exclusion. The reason for this is that the act does not override the consumer protection provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act, formerly the Trade Practices Act. The public consultation process called for submissions on this issue but received none. This is not surprising, because the bill makes no substantive changes to contractual rules or remedies.</span>

Will the government acknowÂ­ledge that the asylum-seeker policies it has pursued for the last three years have encouraged the people smugglers and have manifestly failed; that those failed policies have encouraged thousands of people to queue-jump to try to reach this country illegally at great risk to their lives; and that those failed policies have resulted in a hugely expanded onshore detention system which is now bursting at the seams and has become the scene of riots and mayhem? Will the government now apologise to the Australian people for its failure of leadership in dealing with this issue?</span>

There is no doubt that we face a range of challenges in relation to unlawful people movement through the region. This is a problem that Australia shares in the region with countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, and it is something that we have resolved to tackle in a regional context because we know that we have to work together to address these issues. It was a lesson that the previous government learnt as well about needing regional cooperation in order to deal with these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note in passing that this is a now huge issue around the world. We are seeing Europe responding to large numbers of people fleeing North Africa; in fact, people are demanding a review of the EU arrangements in terms of border control. There are huge issues in the United States and Canada. Unauthorised people movement and people seeking asylum is a huge issue for our century as transportation becomes more available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do not accept the proposition that was put by Senator Abetz. The government is working with countries in the region to try and address the challenge of unlawful movement. We do have a huge issue in that many people are seeking refuge and fleeing persecution, and we as a region have to work to tackle those challenges. A lot of work has been done in recent times through the Bali process, which we have reinvigorated with Indonesia, and the announcement the other day regarding a framework of cooperation with Malaysia is part of that regional response to an issue we are all dealing with.</span>

I think it was cynical, and it was costly. It is worth remembering that the people who were subject to the Pacific solution are now settled in Australia and New Zealand; the vast majority have settled here or in New Zealand. The Howard government did a deal with New Zealand to take a large number of people off the island of Nauru in order to have political cover for the fact that the Pacific solution had failed; it was cynical, it was costly and the reality is that people were resettled in Australia. The Howard government did not like to front up to that, they did not like to publicise that, but the reality is that those people were settled in Australia. So the Pacific solution was no solution. We need regional cooperation, we need the support of our neighbours, and that is what this government is focused on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Senators will be aware that on 2 May President Obama announced that Osama bin Laden, the leader of the international terrorist group al-Qaeda, had been killed in an operation conducted by United States forces in Pakistan. The Australian government very much welcomes this news, as I am sure the Senate does; it represents a great blow against international terrorism. The Prime Minister has spoken with President Obama to pass on Australia's thanks and gratitude to the United States and to their military, who carried out the operation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Osama bin Laden was directly responsible for terrible acts of violence against innocent people, and he inspired acts of violence by others. Under his command, al-Qaeda planned and carried out the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 innocent people were murdered. Bin Laden's al-Qaeda also carried out or was involved with many other terrorist atrocities in which Australians were killed and wounded. Australia remembers those who lost their lives in those attacks, and they include those in Bali on two occasions; in London; in Mumbai; in Jakarta; and, of course, in New York.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's fight against terrorism does not end with bin Laden's death. We must remain vigilant against the threat posed by al-Qaeda and the groups it has inspired. We know that al-Qaeda in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions is not the only terrorist threat that the international community faces. Australia will continue to support the counterterrorism efforts of the United States and our partners. We remain committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorism. This work has already cost Australian lives, and Australians remain at risk, but it is vital and we will continue the mission in Afghanistan.</span>

The government's strong view is that it is in our national interest to be in Afghanistan with the United States and 46 other members of the international community acting under a United Nations mandate. Australia has a responsibility to fight international terrorism and ensure stability in Afghanistan. Australian forces are there to ensure Afghanistan does not again become an operating base from which terrorists recruit, train and launch attacks against us and our allies, as it was under the Taliban dictatorship. Australian forces are there at the request of the government of Afghanistan and operate as part of the United Nations mandated International Security Assistance Force. Training and mentoring the Afghan national security forces will help create the conditions for an irreversible transition of security responsibility. As the Prime Minister has said, Australia will continue to support Afghanistan in some form through this decade at least. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

However, it does not mean an end to the threat of global terror posed by al-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups. The Australian government will continue to make proper preparations in the face of those threats. The government has issued a travel bulletin indicating that there is a risk of reprisals and that people need to be careful about their personal security and avoid large gatherings of people associated with the aftermath of this event. The government has not increased our threat alert either onshore or offshore at this stage, but people do need to be very wary. Australians should continue to monitor the DFAT website when travelling for updates to that travel advice, and of course we always strongly recomÂ­mend that Australian travellers register with the DFAT website. The threat remains from international terrorism, and we continue to urge Australians to be cautious and take due precautions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer the minister to the recent protests at the Villawood detention centre in Sydney. Can the minister explain why it took the Australian Federal Police 11 days to detain the rooftop protesters involved in the Villawood riots? Isn't the government's inability to deal with the protest emblematic of the fact that the government has lost control of the asylum seeker issue just as it has lost control of Australia's borders?</span>

Can I indicate at the outset that the government will not tolerate riots in immigration detention centres. On 4 May 2011, the AFP arrested and charged seven people as a result of the investigation into the disturbances at Villawood. Six people were arrested at Silverwater Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre with cooperation from New South Wales Corrective Services personÂ­nel and transported to the AFP's Sydney offices. Of course, all were charged with a variety of offences as follows: some with affray and some with destroying or damaging property. The government will, of course, continue to take a hard line against anyone who engages in violence in the immigration detention networkâ€”all agencies. While the detention service provider has incident management plans in place to ensure appropriate responses to disturbances at immigration detention facilities, any response, of course, is underÂ­pinned by the fact that immigration detention is administrative, not punitive, in nature. The department has a well-established relationship with law enforcement agencies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the specifics, I will seek further particulars about the time line and the chronology of events, which may assist Senator Brandis. I am advised that, of course, the department has met with senior representatives from all state and territory policeâ€”it is about ensuring that we do maintain law and order within the detention centresâ€”and met with the Australian Federal Police on 19 April 2011. I am advised that that was a productive meeting and part of the routine and ongoing engagement between the department and law enforcement officers to ensure that issues such as that are dealt with expeditiously and early, can I say.</span>

Serco has responsibility for responding to instances within the IDCs. I just want to ensure that the facts are on the table about the circumstances. This includes trained negotiators and extraction teams. If Serco is unable to maintain good order at an IDC, Serco then may request police assistance, which is then assessed in accordance with the circumstances. Within an IDC, those are the processes and procedures that are adopted. The opposition are seeking to compare and contrast it with another incident outside an IDC, but I think it is sensible to say that these are the circumstances of how and when responses are undertaken. So it is Serco within the IDC and then, if it is a matter that requires AFPâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, does it not follow from your previous answer that your government considers that an 11-day long rooftop protest at a detention centre and the destruction of numerous buildings at that detention centre is consistent with maintaining good order? Is this not just another example of your government's inability to manage the immigration system when a Liberal government in New South Wales is able to enforce and police a protest?</span>

It is a comparison that only Senator Brandis would or could make. The government has made it clear that engaging in inappropriate or criminal behaviour whilst in an immigration detention centre will not be tolerated. Contingency plans are in place to respond to instances at immigration detention facilities. The immigration department works actively with Serco to review security staffing system procedures and infrastructure and the minister has already announced an independent review into these instances. In terms of the broader issue, Serco, as the detention service provider, is required to have appropriate security and emergency arrangements in place with local law enforcement agencies and the response times, as I indicated in my primary answer. I will certainly get back to you with a chronology of those events. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It will be a budget that is marked by its commitment to sound financial management, a budget that recognises the challenges of the mining boom and leverages its opportunities for the benefit of all Australians. This sound financial management will be evident in the choices that we have made in this budget and in the fastest fiscal consolidation that we have seen since the 1960s.

This is about getting us back into the black, getting more Australians into jobs and spreading the opportunities of the mining boom, and we will outline a budget which sets out a clear path to the return to surplus, which we are committed to. But what will be interesting to see this week in this parliament is whether the opposition are prepared to apply the same discipline to themselves that they are asserting the government should adhere to. I think we should be running a bit of a wager as to whether they will front up. I wager they will not front up and do what they say they will do. Those opposite might want to know that your shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, has committed to bringing the budget back to surplus on your figures by next year. That is what Mr Hockey has said, but he has not done the numbers to work out how. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I said, it is interesting the shadow Treasurer has committed the oppositionâ€”I bet this was without a shadow cabinet meetingâ€”to returning a surplus by 2011-12. That is after they have climbed out of their $11 billion black hole. So he beat his chest and said, 'We'll make the hard yards.' When pressed he said, 'I don't know what the numbers are.' Well, he will know tonightâ€”and I will bet those opposite will still not be able to work out how to do it. The problem those on the other side have is that Joe Hockey has led them down the garden path; he has made a promise that they will never be able to live up to. How embarrassing for the party that used to be the party of fiscal disciplineâ€”now the party of a budget black hole.</span>

But he has been directly on the topic, providing what information he has about the incident, and it is quite outrageous to suggest that he is not being relevant. If there are other matters that are not covered in his primary answer, the senator has the opportunity to ask two supplementary questions.

                  </a>  Mr President, I have been asked by Senator Cash about an incident that occurred at the centre on 19 March 2011. I am providing information. She has sought to rely on a newspaper report of the allegations as to what occurred on this occasion. I have provided information to the Senate on the basis of the information that has been provided to me by the minister. What I can indicate is that the New South Wales police are making inquiries into the nature of the events that occurred and that no person of interest in relation to the incident has been identified at this stage. The department advised the minister's office of the fire at the time but not of the discovery of the device or that the police had taken it for examination as possible evidence. In terms of what the senator seeks to assert is a matter of priority, that is entirely hypothetical.</span>

Why was the minister not aware of the homemade bomb and what steps has the minister taken to ensure he remains fully informed on the vital issues within his portfolio?</span>

How does the government expect the Australian people to have any faith in their so-called border protection policies if the minister was not even aware of a bomb in a detention centre until he was told by a talkback radio host?</span>

The fire that was the subject of the incident itself was discovered and extinguished by Serco officers at 3.20 in the morning. The local emergency services were called immediately. The New South Wales police attended at 4 am and they took possession of what is now referred to as a bomb and returned later in daylight hours to take photographs. No person of interest has actually been identified at this stage as a result of the police inquiry. The department did not advise the minister at the time and the department secretary has been instructed to find out why not.</span>

The Malaysian High Commissioner today declared that Australia cannot simply dictate which people will be sent to Malaysia under the Gillard government's Malaysian solution. Will the Malaysian government officials come to Australia to select which asylum seekers they will take or will it simply be conducted through paperwork? How will the Malaysian government decide who is sent to their country?</span>

The government has announced that the Australian and Malaysian governments have committed to enter into a landmark transfer agreement under the regional cooperative framework and that this process undermines the efforts of people smugglers to seek to encourage people to undertake very risky journeys to Australia. This in fact is a new initiative to ensure that we are able to take all the necessary steps to highlight the extraÂ­ordinary dangers of undertaking such a voyage and to indicate to people that this is a counterproductive move and is unlikely to produce the results that people are looking for in terms of finding settlement here, because people will be sent to Malaysia, from which many of them come originally, and will be placed at the back of the queue.</span>

The reports today that the Malaysian High Commissioner is wanting the right to refuse people entry are inaccurate and misleading. While the government cannot comment on the specifics of current diplomatic negotiations, the reports that appeared today are incorrect. What I would have thought the Greens would be particularly interested in is that, for the first time, the UNHCR is involved in terms of the Malaysian government, a point which the UNHCR have made and indicated is a matter of some significance to them. The public comments by their spokesperson have highlighted that fact. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I remind the senator that UNHCR regional representative Richard Charles says that this is a bilateral agreement that has been negotiated within the broader regional cooperation framework with the involvement of the UNHCR, the involvement of the IOM, the International Organisation for Migration and, we hope, the involvement of other imÂ­portant actors as well, including non-government organisations. So it is an agreeÂ­ment between countries that are actively involved with refugee issues and that commonly face a refugee displacement problem. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

These are major new initiatives, major new developments, in regard to the way the refugee conventions are being treated within our region.

What I have indicated is that the government will finalise the agreement with Malaysia in the coming weeks, depending on resolution of certain operational matters. I also indicated that it was a bit rich to argue the toss about increasing the humanitarian target, which we are quite proud of, when the Liberal Party during the last election sought to increase it to 15,000 and double it in their conversations when they were trying to secure a majority in the House of RepreÂ­sentativesâ€”a proposition which would have cost $3 billion. That was the claim when they were discussing the matter with Mr Wilkieâ€”$3 billion to get one vote. And they want to argue the toss about increasing slightly the refugee intake numbers that we are doing at the moment! We see here a little of hypocrisy even by Liberal Party standards that sinks to new depths.</span>

I thank the minister for saying initially that they were in the process of developing arrangements and later then saying that it would be a number of weeks, dependent upon certain operational matters. Thank you, Minister. What this really means is that we have no ideaâ€”it could be weeks, months, years. So I asked the minister: what additional steps is the government proposing to stop the flood of boat arrivals who will try to get in in that interregnumâ€”that one week, three months, two years or whatever it isâ€”until this arrangement is finalised?<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are indicating to people who now are contemplating being in the hands of the people smugglers that it is not in their interest to engage in that action by seeking to travel to Australia by boat. We will settle the outstanding matters with Malaysia in the signing of an MOU very, very quickly. We are also in the process of engaging in ongoing talks with the Papua New Guinea government about the establishment of an assessment centre in that country. We have a range of measures, therefore, in place where we are seeking to deal with these matters in a firm but very fair approach to ensure that Australia is able to secure, within its interÂ­national treaty obligations, proper assessÂ­ments of people seeking to come to this country by irregular movements.</span>

This is the first time this has happened with respect to Malaysia and we hope that there will be other important actors as well, which will include non-government organisations. So there is a real opportunity here, an opportunity to deal with these issues in a humane and fair but firm way to ensure that the agreement between this government and other countries involved in refugee issues are treated properly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

One of the key features of the government's digital switchover program is that we have finally brought viewers in regional and remote Australia access to the same number of TV channels as are available in capital citiesâ€”something long thought impossible and certainly never attempted by those opposite. Last week we turned off the analog signals in regional Victoria. More than 455,000 households across the state have made the move to digital-only television. We have had less than 100 complaints in the five days since the switch. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

When asked about those issues she indicated that that was one of the issues that would be reflected upon when those arrangements were finalised. So that agreement and the MOU will reflect the finalised arrangements in relation to returns to Malaysia. I might point out, though, that it was the Liberal Party that used to detain children in detention centres. This government has ensured that children are not in detention centres but are in alternative arrangements, where they are allowed to live with their families. I think we all support that as a much more humane and appropriate way of dealing with children.</span>

Given that we are dealing with larger numbers of both accompanied and unaccomÂ­panied minors, we have been looking for better alternatives than existed preciously, and I would just like to acknowledge the work of those community groups, churches, the Red Cross and others who sought to support the government in providing better alternatives for unauthorised arrival families which have children and of course for unaccompanied minors. In terms of the primary point of Senator Abetz's question, those details will be finalised as part of the MOU.</span>

But what non-negotiable preconditions have been sought from the Malaysians to ensure that minors are protected?

We actually put in place better arrangements for children so that they receive proper care.

I do have some additional news about new support for small business in the areas of Australia that have been devastated by the recent natural disasters, floods and Cyclone Yasi. Of course, the Gillard government remains focused, as an ongoing priority, on the recovery of these regions and the businesses and individuals that have been affected. The government is providing an additional $3.3 million funding boost to small business support groups to help them deliver additional services to assist Australia's disaster-affected small business.</span>

                  </a>  No, it is not the ACTU, Senator Macdonald. You trivialise the very important work of the BECs, the business enterprise centres. They are dedicated, hardworking and committed. They worked, and are still working, enormously long hours to assist in the disaster-affected areas to provide additional assistance, ongoing support, counselling, business recovery and advice to the many small businesses affected. For Senator Macdonald to trivialise with that sort of silly interjection the enormous commitment and hard work that the BECs are doing on behalf of small businesses in these disaster areas is a reflection on Senator Macdonald.</span>

                  </a>  Again, a trivial interjection. We are not shutting them down. There might be some state governments shutting them down, but we have expanded the funding. I am very proud that it is this government that introduced funding for the business enterprise centres. It was an election commitment in 2007 and it was delivered by my predecessor, Dr Emerson. We are very proud of the work the BECs have done. They deserve the additional funding, even if Senator Macdonald and the Liberal Party do not think it is deserved.</span>

We are actually expanding the services being offered, Senator Macdonald, contrary to the silly interjection you made earlier and the quite false claim that we are cutting back on the centres. We are expanding the reach of these centres. Senator Macdonald would be well advised to go and visit some of the small businesses that have been receiving advice from the new centre in Cairns. You are obviously so divorced from the issue and from your own community that you have got no appreciation of the work of these centres. Many of the advisers are formerly small business operators, and they are referred to small business operators.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Health and Ageing has also received a proposal from the NSW government seeking funding for a number of aged care places at a multi-purpose service in Gulgong. This proposal is currently being considered by the Department against the criteria listed in the Aged Care Act 1997.</span>

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Last year, the Government announced that some funding from within the Family Relationships Services Program would be re-directed to provide legal assistance and advice to help separating families resolve disputes with targeted legal assistance delivered by organisations such as community legal centres.</span>

              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">However, the Government continues to provide more than $200 million in funding each year for the Family Relationship Services Program.

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Early indications since redirecting the funding indicate that this new approach to providing legal assistance for couples attending Family Relationship Centres has been positive and demonstrated that early and targeted legal advice can help couples resolve their disputes without resorting to the courts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an interesting day today because, to be honest, very few people are going to be watching us; they have got other things on. But people stopped listening to the Labor Party long ago. I came to parliament this week thinking that maybe things would settle down, and then all of a sudden we had what would have to be one of the most peculiar decisions that has ever been foisted on this nationâ€”the so-called Malaysian deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To throw further light on the Malaysian deal today, we had Senator Carr's response to the 'little bomb' issue. They had a little fire and they found a little bomb and they got a little inkling that something was going on. They found a little bomb at one of the detention centres. But don't worryâ€”it was not a big problem; it was only a little problem as it was only a little bomb. There was a little fire going at the same time. There was a much bigger fire earlier onâ€”a really big fire. That was a big problem, but then they had a little problem. Unfortunately, the peptic ulcer inside the government's stomach started to give a bit of a twitch and they realised that they had to do something. So the thought police, the brains trust, of the Labor Party got together and worked out this deal. They got on the blower and started ringing people all around the world to see if they could come up with a deal to cover up for the fact that the budget was going to be a disaster and that they also had a bit of a problem because people keep burning down buildings in the middle of Sydneyâ€”burning them down, mind you, when Australians are sleeping on the street merely miles away. That is the more sobering side of the problem that they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently we are sending to Malaysia 800 people and then they are sending back to us 4,000 people. There is logic in that somewhere, apparently. It started off as a one-to-one deal, but it has somehow changed while Julia Gillard was negotiating. She cannot say it and she cannot do it, but she decided that she was going to negotiate her way out of the problem and this is how she would do it. Not only are we sending Malaysia 800 people and getting 4,000 in return but we are also sending them about $292 million. This sounds like the deal of the century. This is Labor Party politics. Now we also find that there will be a trail fee, a sort of trail commission, on this and apparently we are going to have to pay them another lazy $200 million to look after the problem. So it is about half a billion dollars and rising for this complete and utter fiasco.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a deal like this, I expect the phones to be running hot in Julia Gillard's office. We will have Hugo Chavez on the phone saying, 'Mate, I can do a better deal for you. How about you send me 50 and I will send you 10,000. And I'll cut the price: I'll do it for a lazy 100 mill.' President Koroma of Sierra Leoneâ€”another country that is not a party to the United Nations refugee conventionâ€”will be on the phone: 'Don't worry, Julia; I'll help you out. I've got a few refugees here. How about we park a couple of hundred thousand over there. We could send you a couple of hundred thousand refugees, because we've got them in bulk. We've got a civil war on; we can park them over there.' Maybe we could go to the former Prime Minister of Somalia, Haji Hussein. He has probably got a few refugees. He should be in the market. It could be one of their biggest exportsâ€”exporting refugees to Australia. It is just so bizarre. You have become so bizarre. You have become so strange that if you did not laugh you would cry. And we get all this for the lazy sum of $292 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted just before the budget that a good bloke called Kenneth Rogoff from Harvard University has been listing the countries that have had the greatest cumulative increase in real public debt since 2007. I will go through the top three because we do not want to mention every country in the world: No.1, Icelandâ€”we all know about Iceland; No. 2, Ireland; and No. 3, Australia. You get yourself into debt like that when you come up with ludicrous, mind-numbing solutions such as spending half a billion dollars on making your problem of 3,200 people bigger. We pay them half a billion dollars and the net effect in Australia is that we are 3,200 people worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who thought that up? Who is the plant from the Liberal Party or the National Party in Julia Gillard's office giving her this advice? Own upâ€”who are you? Stop giving her this advice. Stop making it easy for us, please. We do not need any more help. This is what is happening. This is the manic world of the Labor Party. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  On rising to speak on the motion to take note of answers, I am very proud of the fact that this government believes in real regional cooperation on asylum seekers. We know that, ultimately, that is the best way to manage this issue. It is also the best humanitarian outcome, something the Howard government, frankly, was never interested in. I, like most Australians, feel strongly about honouring our international protection obligations, and it is sad to me that Senator Joyce does not seem to take that obligation seriously. I do not shy away from the fact that we must find a better way to support vulnerable refugees. Our resolve to end the dangerous transport of so many vulnerable lives in shonky boats is one that I support. You need look no further than at the loss of nearly 30 lives before last Christmas off Christmas Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Malaysia has taken a much greater burden on it as a nation in terms of managing asylum seekers, with an estimated 100,000 people seeking refuge there. A fundaÂ­mentally important part of this arrangement is that the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, will be working to process the 800 refugees that Australia will send to be processed in Malaysia and will work closely with us to resettle the 4,000 that will come here as part of this increased humanitarian intake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my mind, this is no small thing. I am but one of thousands of Australians who make a small monthly donation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees fund, which works to support, resettle and process refugees. The UNHCR has a very difficult job and has been encouraging of Australia and other countries seeking to work together to find regional solutions on this issue, to support vulnerable people who need our protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our arrangement with Malaysia is something we have been working on over the last six months as part of a regional cooperation framework. Very sadly, Mr Tony Abbott and Mr Scott Morrison have turned a blind eye to the facts when mounting their scare campaign on these issues. Frankly, I am surprised that Mr Abbott objects to an increase in the humanitarian intake. He showed he was prepared to support such an increase and in fact double the intake to win Mr Andrew Wilkie's support in the House of Representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to delivering on regional cooperation. This may be hardâ€”it may be difficultâ€”but ultimately it is the only path which will see better outcomes for asylum seekers throughout the region. We will see better outcomes for people who would otherwise languish in our detention centres. This arrangement is but the first step, and we need to keep talking to countries in the region. It is no easy task. We are working through the Bali process, we are talking to Papua New Guinea and we are working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Such apÂ­proaches were never a real prospect under the Howard government. Mr Abbott has simple rhetoricâ€”'Stop the boats,' he saysâ€”but he has no credible plan to enhance the capacity of refugees to get the protection to which they are entitled throughout the region in an orderly fashion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="G0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  May I issue an apology to all the Australian people listening to this broadcast for wasting five minutes of their lives listening to a bunch of nonsense from Senator Pratt. It was just extraordinary that Senator Pratt was interjecting on Senator Joyce during his speech, saying, 'This is not a joke,' and yet everything that Senator Pratt has said makes an absolute mockery of what the government has been saying for the last three years and the 10 years previously. During this time our discredited Prime Ministerâ€”and I say she is discredited because we cannot believe a word that comes out of her mouth nowâ€”has duped an increasingly sceptical and disillusioned public by saying that offshore processing is inhumane, it is wrong and it has no place here in Australia. The only thing she has not acknowledged in the entire thing is that offshore processing actually stops the trade in people smuggling and it stops the boats from coming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But according to the government the boats were coming due to push factors and it had nothing whatsoever to do with the soft treatment they have received in Australia since the government changed the laws. The facts speak for themselves: since 2008, 224 boats have come to this country, entering Australian waters illegally and carrying 11,246 arrivals seeking asylum. Since the last election we have had nearly 4,500 people arrive, and still the government said that nothing was wrong and that they would not go back to the inhumane treatment of refugees. There is nothing more inhumane than having people in a detention centre who are threatening the lives of other people by setting it on fire, by having riots and by planting bombs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government would not acknowledge these risks, but all of a sudden it has now done a deal. It has ditched the East Timor solution, which it has been defending for months since the last election, and it has cooked up the Malaysian solution. I say 'cooked up' because it has been cobbled together, clearly at the last minute. But the government's representative, Senator Pratt, has just told us that the government has been working on this for many months. They have been negotiating with themselves, because they have talked themselves out of a one-for-one deal to a one-for-two deal, a one-for-three deal et cetera, until they got a one-for-five deal. But let me tell you: that is not all you get, and it is not all that Malaysia get. They also get hundreds of millions of Australian taxpayer dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are very sympathetic to the plight of those who are in need. That is why we have a humanitarian refugee program. What they do not like are those people who are seeking to jump the queue and bypass the system. Yet this government seem to want to encourage that. They have said that they will not deal with an offshore processing centre on Nauru because it is not a signatory to the UNHCRâ€”and yet they go off and deal with Malaysia, which is also not a signatory to the UNHCR. Is there any wonder that the Australian public are questioning the very legitimacy of this government?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since when have we had a circumstance where the Australian people cannot believe a word that comes out of the Prime Minister's mouth? Since when have we had a circumstance where the Australian people believe that everything their government tells them is based on spin and lies? And they have got good reason to be suspicious of everything this government says, because not only do we know that the Prime Minister is an illegitimate prime minister but we also know that this government is so bereft of any structure and of any substance that it cannot manage the most simple policy decisions. It has put at risk Australia's border security. We know that; the evidence speaks for itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now the government expect the Australian public to believe that they have done a good deal on our behalf, because when we get the next 800 people arriving in this country illegally we are going to swap them for 4,000 people who are in Malaysia seeking asylum. Eight hundred for 4,000â€”I would love to play poker with our Prime Minister. Whatever money she has got left after squandering it on so many bad programs would soon be in my pocket, because she cannot even carry off a bluff adequately. This is the problem we have: we have a government that do not know what they believe in and we have a Prime Minister who does not believe in anything. She has put everything on the shelfâ€”everything that she has spent her entire life defending. And you wonder why the Australian people say, 'Enough is enough; we need to go to an election'.</span>

I think they must have spent the last few weeks listening to the more extreme radio shock jocks and reading emails from the more extreme right-wing groups. They seem very buoyed up, comparing finding a solution to the refugee issue in our region with poker games where people are swapped like betting chips; yet, in the same breath, they criticise the Australian government for their reaction to it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that the opposition clearly does not understand is this concept of a regional framework.

We are dealing with increased numbers of refugees around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that solution, we have agreed to take an extra number of refugees. Clearly, there are some in the community that are going to dislike that. But what is the alternative? We leave refugees to pile up in Malaysia or Indonesia under very poor conditions? What is the serious proposal of other parties in this discussion? It is to go back to a solution that they found useful a decade ago. It is no longer useful. It is important now to look at the current situation and look at a way to address the situation that gives due respect to other countries in the region that are also experiencing an increase in the number of refugees and gives due respect to those refugees. It is, in the end, a practical solution to the problem. This is what the Gillard government has attempted to do. This arrangement will provide a method by which the refugee cases will be processed according to the UNHCR, which, as has been pointed out by the opposition, Malaysia has never been a party to. It now will be. Surely that is an advance which should get some recognition from the opposition. But no, they go onto these fantastic flights of fantasy about other countries joining in. This ignorance stems from a refusal to listen or to give good analysis to a situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No government would expect an opposition party not to critique its policy, but a nation would expect an opposition to be able to seriously address the issues and come up with a reasonable, sensible alternative proposal if necessary. It is clear, from today anyway, that the opposition has got nowhere near that state of affairs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="J7Q" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  To paraphrase the now Prime Minister: another 224 boats, another 224 policy failures. When Ms Gillard was the shadow minister for immigration, not often did she have to come up with that line 'Another boat, another policy failure'. Regrettably, there have been 83 boats since she became Prime Minister on 24 June and 69 since the election of last year when Labor reversed what was a successful policy of the last coalition government, handed to them on a plate and rejected. That equates since 2008 to no less than 11,246 asylum seekers who have arrived on these shores. What we see yet again today is failure by an incompetent Prime Minister and an incompetent Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in this latest effortâ€”that is, to try and strike a deal with Malaysia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was in March of this year that the asylum seekers rioted on Christmas Island. What was the reward after the first night of riots for those who led it? They in fact got their wish and they were air-transported to Darwin on the mainland. So what happened the next night on Christmas Island? The riots naturally extended and expanded to where others in detention, staff and people on the island were at risk. We now move forward to April this year, a continuing policy of a failed incompetent minister, to Villawood. As others have said, we saw not only firefighters, staff and others in Villawood put at risk but the destruction of Australian government property in this effort led by the allowance of an incompetent minister. What action have we seen taken? As spelt out here this afternoon, 11 days it took for the Federal Police to get these people down off the roof of that detention centre. Australians are heartily sick and tired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now see the latest knee-jerk reaction. Nobody believed that East Timor was going to participate in this so-called regional solution. There has now been a suggestion of Manus Island. That is probably a smart one because it is a return to the Howard governÂ­ment solution. We have just heard Senator Hurley, the previous speaker, making reference to involving and including those in the region. We now know, of course, that Nauru itself is willing to sign up to the UNHCR. We already have the assets available to us in that country. It only requires the Prime Minister and her incompetent minister to swallow their pride, pick up the phone and get on with what worked in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen a billion dollar blowout in the budget for immigration during the current financial yearâ€”budgeted at $200 million but will cost over $1 billion. One can only wonder what we are going to see this evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spent much time in Malaysia. I have even spent a brief time as a guest of the corrective services department in Malaysian detention centres. I can assure you they are not a place you would want to spend more time than is necessary. For those who do not believe that, they need to consult nobody else other than Anwar Ibrahim. But we have also now learnt that the Malaysians quite correctly will reserve for themselves the right to actually determine who of the 800 come to this country. So let us see the scene: the asylum seekers leave their home country, they go through Malaysiaâ€”incidentally, they have a passport when they go through Malaysiaâ€”they get on a boat, they come down here, they are processed, nobody likes them, so what happens? They go back to Malaysia and guess what happens to the people smugglers: they get to sell a second ticket, because they will leave that detention and once again return to Australia. The merry-go-round created by this incompetent government will only continue. The people smugglers are the ones who probably are smiling the most. Naturally those who do end up coming down on the boats a second time will destroy their identification papers and their passports, which gives us more work to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my comments with the observation that when the Howard government stopped the boats they continued the level of migration by genuine refugees, those who had been waiting for years and continue to wait for years in camps and who are currently being put further to the back of the queue because of these queue jumpers, most of them well-heeled, who are making a mockery of this country and its citizens.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  I listened very carefully to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in his answers to some of the questions he was asked today in question time, and I caught the phrase 'sleazy deal', which I will have another look at when I review the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> tomorrow. But I have to say for the minister's information that the only sleazy deal that is actually being done is the deal that is being done by the Gillard government with the government of Malaysia: 'We'll give you 800; however, in return we'll take another 4,000.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has shown the people of Australia that there is no principle that it is not willing to break, no promise it is not willing to not keep and no policy that it is not willing to shred in the interests of staying in power. Based on what we have seen with the latest thought bubble coming out of the Prime Minister, the Malaysian deal, Australians can only assume that the Prime Minister of Australia must wake up each morning and say to herself: 'What do I believe in today? What spin or tall story can I give to the media so that they can tell the people of Australia that maybe I have some form of idea or policy, even if those ideas or policies have a shelf life of approximately 24 hours?' This is no better reflected than in the deal that has been done by the Gillard government, the so-called Malaysian deal: the deal where we send one asylum seeker to Malaysia and in return the Malaysian government sends us five back. That is the deal that has been struck by the Gillard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say the absolute absurdity of this deal was summarised quite beautifully today in a cartoon in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Advocate</span> newspaper on page 15. The cartoon is of the Prime Minister, and it has a thought bubble coming from her head which says: 'Hee hee! We trade their 4,000 for our 800 and we throw in $290 million, and the Malaysians fell for it.' That sums up the state of this deal that the Gillard government has done with the Malaysians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on top of that, what Australians need to understand is that they pay for everything under this deal. The Malaysians are not going to be paying for anything. We have negotiated a deal whereby we give, we take back even more and we pay for both the giving and the taking. For every refugee that we are going to be giving back to Malaysia, Australians will have paid $90,000, and for every refugee that we will be taking from Malaysia to Australia Australian taxpayers will have paid approximately $54,000. That is absolutely absurd, but I have to say that, if I were the government of Malaysia, I would have snapped up the deal. I would have snapped it up and then I would have turned to the Prime Minister and I would have said, 'Are there any other deals that you'd like to do today?' because I am quite sure that, with the way that that Prime Minister negotiates, there was certainly a deal to be had by the Malaysian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is not against genuine refugees seeking asylum in Australia. What we are against, however, is an incompetent government that has absolutely no idea whatsoever about maintaining the integrity of Australia's borders. The so-called Malaysian dealâ€”on top of the potential to do the deal with PNG, on top of the fact that the Nauruan government would actually like the phone picked up for a call to them and on top of the fact that we also had East Timor thrown in the mix at one stageâ€”represents nothing more and nothing less than a panicked announcement by a Prime Minister who realised that she was running out of options very quickly and the only policies that actually worked were the policies of the former Howard government. Because the details are so lacking under the Malaysian deal, the Prime Minister of Australia cannot even tell the Australian people which refugees we will be getting from Malaysia and, more so, which refugees we will be sending to Malaysia. The Prime Minister of Australia has refused to rule out whether or not pregnant females, children, the elderly and people who have disabilities seeking asylum in Australia will be sent to Malaysia as part of the deal that was struck with them. If this is true, it is possibly the most inhumane move I have ever heard from any government. It is an absolute disgrace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is worse is the utter hypocrisy from the Labor Left, because it was reported in the newspapers today that this Malaysian dealâ€”despite the lack of detail, despite the obvious flaws and despite the complete disregard of a humanitarian approachâ€”has been accepted by the left wing of the Labor Party. If that is trueâ€”and we have no reason to doubt it is notâ€”there is only one conclusion that can be reached about the Labor Left: they have trashed their principles and they have let the Prime Minister of Australia walk all over them and throw out their core values. Clearly, they do not have the guts to stand up to the Prime Minister and tell her that she is wrong. The members and senators of the Labor Left should be ashamed. They are being ignored and they are being ridiculed by the Prime Minister of Australia. In fact, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper today reports that left faction convenor Doug Cameron initially had reservations about the plan but Senator Cameron, who tackled Ms Gillard on the issue at yesterday's caucus meeting, said he had come to see it as an innovative solution. It must have been a pretty pathetic tackle if the outcome is that the Labor Left have rolled over, had their tummies tickled by the Prime Minister and have accepted that the Malaysian deal is in some way innovative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Which part of the deal do the so-called Labor Left see as innovative? Is it the part where for every one asylum seeker we get five back? They probably do like that part of the deal. Is it the part where the Prime Minister has refused to rule out the deportation of pregnant women and children and has refused to rule out the deportation of the elderly or the infirm? Perhaps the Labor Left really like the part where the Prime Minister of Australia said, 'We are going to do a deal with Malaysia, even though last year I am on the record as saying that I will rule out anywhere that is not a signatory to the refugee convention.' We all know that Malaysia is not a signatory to the refugee convention. Perhaps the Labor Left were won over by Malaysia's alleged undertaking that asylum seekers will not be sent back to the country that they are fleeing from. All I can say to the left wing of the Labor Party is that I hope that statement by the government of Malaysia is not one with the same substance as the statement by Prime Minister Gillard the day before the scheduled election last year when she said to the people of Australia, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' We all know what happened as soon as the Prime Minister assumed officeâ€”she changed tack. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Labor Left: you have rolled over just like you did on the pay equity deal. You rolled over and you played dead. You did not have the guts to stand up and, just like that, you have done the same here. You have rolled over and you are betraying your constituency by agreeing to the Malaysian solution. You are now endorsing the Prime Minister of Australia's game of Pacific bingo. What Pacific island will the Prime Minister come up with next? We have had East Timor for months and months. East Timor was the be-all and end-all for the Labor Party. That was going to be the saviour policy for the Labor Party. We on this side had consistently said it was never going to happen, and every time we said that what did the Labor Party tell us? We were wrong. And now it has been absolutely, completely and utterly ruled out not only by the East Timorese but also by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen. East Timor is done and dusted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we have in the press the other day? We had PNG. We had the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and CitizenÂ­ship, Andrew Metcalfe, making a quick and quiet trip up to PNG to have a chat with the PNG government about whether or not we should reopen Manus Island, despite what the Labor Party has said about Manus Island in the past. Lo and behold! Before the dust had even settled on the newspapers, the Malaysian deal was struck, allegedly. According to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, it is going to be struck within the next few weeksâ€”signed, sealed and delivered. On top of that, we have Nauru in the mixâ€”the only country that wants the Prime Minister to pick up the phone and say, 'Can we bring refugees to you?' The Prime Minister refuses to deal with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is in complete disarray. This is a government that has a minister whose department is failing to tell him what is going on in the detention centres. We have a Prime Minister and a Labor government that is so desperate that it will do anything and say anything and accept any deal in an attempt to get itself out of the mess it is in.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  I did check the diary today to see what day it was just to remind myself which particular section 75 debate we would have, because if you look at the record over the last several months one day per sitting we have had words very similar to those used today. I think there are three words that are different today but it is the same process.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator MOORE:</span>
                  </a>  I'm sorry; maybe you should check for the next sitting Tuesday so that we can get those words accurateâ€”so we know, so we can get the rhetoric right. I have listened to the debates very carefully, I have taken part in a few of them, and it is really great to have the consistency of the rhetoric, even down to the point of making sure that someone, somewhere gets some guts. We are consistently reminded of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really strongly believe that these issues are so important that we must continue to discuss, we must continue to find a solution that will be something that the whole of the parliament can share. But, in that process, what truly disturbs me is that, every time the opposition put up this motion, they begin with an announcement that we have to secure Australia's borders and the process seems to indicate, and we have seen it over many years, a visual picture of Australia being under attack, being invaded. They build up the fear, they build up the rhetoric and they put in place a view that any discussion of the serious issues of asylum seekers in our nation and in our world should be derailed by the premise that we are already in a warlike situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not new from the opposition. We have seen elections fought using this process. At no time has there been any attempt to hide the number of boats, to mislead with numbers. In fact, what we see is an agreed process whereby when a boat is found to be coming towards Australia that is announced openly to the world. We are told that a boat has been found, we are told how many people are on it and we are told what the process will be. It is not exactly a clandestine, secret operation. In terms of the numbers that have been thrown around in this chamber, we can determine exactly what numbers there were, how many people were involved. These are people who are seeking asylum; we must remember that. We are looking at that issue, and as a country and as a parliament we need to come up with a process under which we take due responÂ­sibility as a nation. We must take that responsibility. There is no doubt about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot explain how pleased I was to have a lecture in this asylum debate today about compassion in processing people. I totally support that. That word, that process and that value should have seen a higher level of debate in this place over the past number of years. That needs to be on the agendaâ€”treating people with compassion. Certainly that is something that will be part of any decision, of any agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, the rhetoric is very important. In the previous speaker's contribution we did not hear about international negotiations, we did not hear about discussions that were held openly between nations to come up with a solution, including at the recent Bali conference. That was a conference; it was not some kind of poker game where people were sitting around making deals. Again, colouring the debate, ensuring that instead of listening to what was happening, instead of understanding the seriousness of the issue, it is better to marginalise, to use rhetoric which takes the focus away from the issue, and also to give those quick one-liners that can be picked up so easily in the media, that can be used to scare, to terrify, to make people genuinely afraid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have had over the period of the Rudd and Gillard governments is an acknowledgement that there is a real issue of asylum seekers in our region. We have also identified as a country that, based on international circumstances, it is an issue not only in our region. The issue of asylum seekers, people fleeing to seek another place to live because of conditions in their homelands, is something that countries are struggling with, making negotiations about and working to come to solutions on across the whole world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no different in the Asia-Pacific region. In fact, what has been acknowledged in the Asia-Pacific region is that because of a number of key issues over the past few years in our regionâ€”including the continuing war on Afghanistan, the issues in Sri Lanka, what is happening around the Iranian issue and, most particularly in the past couple of years, the uncertainty in Pakistanâ€”more people are fleeing into the Asia-Pacific area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has our government done? We have said that we wish to work with the other countries in our region to come up with a regional solution. This is similar in some ways to the negotiations, the commitment that governments have made towards the good work that has been done in the past on trafficking and people-smuggling, where we have been able to work with other nations to make sure that everybody has acknowledged and accepted their own responsibilities. What has been referred to as the Malaysian deal, which is an agreement between two countries, is premised on the fact that there is an issue in our region. No-one denies that one of the key points in the journey that people take in this region is Malaysia. They have a significant problem. More than 90,000 people in the Malaysian Peninsula have been identified as seeking asylum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a real need for all countries in our region to understand their responsibilities. We have made a commitment that we will, as a signatory to the international convenÂ­tion, work within that framework to come up with a solution. It is true Malaysia and other nations in our region have not yet signed up to that convention, and that is a serious gap in the process. Labor was absolutely scathing of the coalition government and our policies, especially the Pacific solution, and vowed to end them in government. The fact is they worked. We controlled our borders and it was the Australian government who decided who was to come to Australia. An the infamous words from some, but for us a statement of how it is, I can recall John Howard's words: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we look back now. That is not the case at all, is it? It is not only the people smugglers that are going to make this decision nowadaysâ€”we know that the responsibility has now gone to themâ€”but now it is also, I understand, the Malaysian government. They have obviously done a pretty good deal on this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to touch for a moment on the contribution from Senator Moore in regard to our policies and that somehow they lack compassion. I would remind Senator Moore and those on the other side that I do not think there is a lot of compassion in a policy that allows people to place the lives of women, children and men on boats that we saw demonstrated at Christmas Island in December on that fateful, tragic day. As a consequence of getting on their boat, so many lives were lost in a pretty horrific way. I do not think you can say that it is not compassionate to ensure that under the UNHCR those people with the highest priority in the world come first. That is the idea. There are 50 million people seeking a migration outcome. We must give the priority to those most in need, and we have identified those people who are leading in abject poverty and misery in the Horn of Africa. The majority of those refugees on boats are not priority refugees, because they can least afford to get on a vessel and to pick a forum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is the latest bumbling attempt to empty our detention centres with the proposal to ship 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia? Well, in return we are going to receive 4,000 refugees picked for us specially in Malaysia. If this plan were cooked up by anyone else, people would have dismissed it as a bad joke. UnfortunÂ­ately, it is real and only could be put down to a desperate and incompetent government. A one-off deal: 800 out, 4,000 in and, by the way, we get to pay every single way. Who could possibly have sat down and said, 'This is in Australia's national interest. You can have 800 of ours, we'll take 4,000 yours and we'll pay everything that is going for.'? I mean, really, spare me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the media originally said that this was going to be a two-for-one swap, but such was the strength of the negotiating capacity of the Labor Party, we actually managed to back it up to five to one! If that is not an act of desperation I don't know what is. Malaysia seriously saw the Prime Minister and Minister Bowen coming. That is a complete act of desperation. They have actually got to settle 4,000 refugees in another country at no cost and only had to take 800 people in return, with Australia also footing the bill for that process. Wouldn't it be great if we could do a deal like that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can recall them saying that this is going to stop the boats. I can tell you what it will do. It will make sure that boats arrive in a different placeâ€”called mainland Australia, mark my words. This is a sophisticated place to play in and you need sophisticated policies that are able to respond. They will not be going to Christmas Island; they will be coming to mainland Australia. If you live where I liveâ€”in Darwinâ€”or in Broome in Western Australia, they will be the sort of things to look out for. I am not sure, again, that that is in our interests. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does appear to be that, once again, it is only really pride and vanity that prevent this hopeless, incompetent, weak and indecisive government from picking up the phone and actually doing a deal that has been there forever. Ring up the President of Nauru. They have the facilitiesâ€”again, run by IMO. We have a senator shaking his head on the other sideâ€”'No doubt it is because they are not actually a signatory of the convention.' Well, sir, neither is Malaysia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the meltdown of the borders is completely emblematic of the government's weak, indecisive nature. You are not capable of making a decisionâ€”we know that right across the board. But even when it you come to make decisions you give away our national interest in the process. Weak and indecisive. It will never do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Thank you for your protection, Mr Acting Deputy President. The fact of the matter is that this opposition is treating the arrangements as if it is some human bargainâ€”as if a person-for-person arrangement is a fair trade. This is not about a trade. This is, on the one hand, this governÂ­ment accepting Australia as a developed country with substantial resources has the capacity to receive refugees who have been through the appropriate processâ€”and, after all, wasn't that the proposition which the former government advanced as justifying the Pacific solution? This government is saying: 'Let's get the UNHCR working in Malaysia. Let's get the UNHCR involved in Malaysiaâ€”and the IOM. Let's get an assessment of people who have been waiting there for years'â€”and we are told there are over 93,000 of themâ€”'and let's make a small contribution and accept 4,000 of them and for Malaysia to make a contribution to what has been agreed on a regional basis in the Pacific region, and that is: let's find a way to disrupt the people smuggler arrangements which lead to a train of people moving from Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran through this region looking for sanctuary, predomÂ­inately in Australia.' So there is nothing wrong with the government's proposal to find a way to get the Malaysian government to become involved in a regional solution to disrupt the activities of people smugglers. But, of course, we are reminded of the coalition's Pacific solutionâ€”we were told that all we had to do was pick up the phone and we could have returned to it. We could have made an arrangement with Nauru about what was once perhaps but is not now a ready-to-function destination for potential refugees. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the UNHCR say about the Pacific solution anyway? I think it was Richard Towle, the spokesman for the UNHCR who said:</span>
              </p>

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Australia was obviously looking at ways to divest itself of some of the responsibilities of dealing with refugees.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is: the former government was seeking to divest Australia of its responsibilities to deal with refugees. That is what he said. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The countries that were negotiated, Nauru and PNG at that time, did not have a refugee issue of their own and largely became places were Australia was able to manage its own protection responsibilities under the convention.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">So it was not a regional burden-sharing arrangement at all. It was much more of a responsibility-shifting arrangement. And that's why we think they are not only philosophically but also in the way they were implemented they're quite different types of arrangements. </span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said the latter reflecting on the proposed arrangements, those to which there has been in-principle agreement between the Australian government and the Malaysian government. I say again: Australia is in the position to accept refugees and there are refugees who satisfy the test and are waiting for an opportunity and looking for an opportunity to come to a country such as Australia. Over many years Australia has accepted its responsibility. I believeâ€”unless someone tells me this is not the caseâ€”that this is a bipartisan policy between the opposition and the government. We both agree that this country has the capacity to accept refugees, has a responsibility to accept refugees and is prepared to accept refugees who go through a process of seeking asylum from outside of our borders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has this put in place? It puts in place arrangements where, on the one hand, those refugees languishing in Malaysia will get an enhanced opportunity to come to Australia if they satisfy the necessary tests. On the other hand, people smugglers, particularly in Indonesia, will be faced with the problem of convincing those who hitherto would have paid the money to come to Australia that in fact they are not paying the money to go backwards and end up in Malaysia. Self-evidently, that is a proposition which will cause a great deal of trouble to the people smugglers in Indonesia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course it was the government's hope to negotiate such an arrangement with East Timor. I am happy to say that, although East Timor does not find itself able to move down that path, Malaysia does. The government has also announced that it has in train discussions with other countries about broadening the scope for such a policy, because, at the end of the dayâ€”and I think this was also the policy of the coalitionâ€”this problem is not just an Australian problem; it is a problem for the region. There are refugees in Indonesia. There are refugees in Malaysia. In the future, one suspects, there will be refugees looking to go to countries such as Papua New Guinea as their economy improves, particularly as the mining sector grows and there is more wealth and opportunities there. There will be other islands in the Pacific which will be seen as destinations for refugees. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is a regional problem and it is a problem that is developing. It is a problem that is not going to go away just by Australia trying to shift its responsibilities, as the Pacific solution did, by shifting those people to places of detention in Nauru and PNG with no other solution available. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the UNHCR and the Malaysian government have embraced this approach, given Malaysia's history on refugees, shows just what a substantial breakthrough this arrangement is and just what sort of deterrent this will be for the people smugglers in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 8 February, the UNHCR spoke about the previous Nauru situation and the then closure of that centre the UNHCR said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">â€¦ </span>
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">in our view, today's closure of the centre on Nauru signals the end of a difficult chapter in Australia's treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. Many bona fide refugees caught by the policy spent long periods of isolation, mental hardship and uncertainty â€“ and prolonged separation from their families.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality was of course that many of those people ultimately found their way either to Australia or New Zealand. So all that that arrangement did was defer the inevitableâ€”that genuine refugees would find a location and that, being in our region, the likelihood was that it would be Australia or New Zealand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note Senator Scullion talked about the cost of arrangements with Malaysia. We were paying substantial amounts of money to the Nauruan government and the government in PNG for them to operate facilities on our behalf as well as paying for the cost of the operation. So let them not say on the one hand that we are spending money on arrangements with Malaysia, when they spent money, on just the same basis, when they wanted to locate refugees in Nauru and PNG when they were in government. So it really is a bit hypocritical of those who would argue that we should not be paying that money, when one looks at the performance of the previous government.</span>

                  </a>  Good. Anyway, that is what he chooses to do in his dying days of politics and being a parliamentarian. What a shame, because you know as well as everyoneâ€”everyone on that side knowsâ€”that this is a case of 'here we go again'. This is not the East Timor solution. This is not the people's assembly. This is not the Papua New Guinea deal. This is the Malaysian deal. It is a new one. It is a brand new deal that you knew nothing about. Cabinet did not know. You are taking it all over again from your leadership. You do not have to; you should not. It is no way to run a government, it is no way to run a country and it is no way to serve in public office at all. Sooner or later you have got to stand up to that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard one speaker mention the 'consistency of this debate'. You bet it is consistent; it has been going on for years. Let me read to you, for the purposes of those on broadcast, what this debate is about. They will recognise the terms of this debate, because it has been going on since 2008. It reads: '<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The Gillard governmentâ€™s continued failure to secure Australiaâ€™s borders and introduce policies to deny people smugglers the product they sell'. </span>It is a consistent debate, and we have been consistent in putting up the policies to fix the problem. We have been consistent in bringing the government to account. It is the government's inconsistency and policy failure after policy failure. The only consistency is that the leadership will announce it, when you know nothing about it, and within 24 hours you have to walk in here and defend it. You are given your riding instructions, you are given your dot points and you dutifully undertake the defence of the indefensible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite often I come into this place singing the praises of Senator Doug Cameron. He is on a different political spectrum from me, but I have always looked for what Senator Doug Cameron has said in the newspapers. I always like to cut these things out and put them into my top pocket for moments like this. I have always thought, 'Here's a man, unlike the other weaklings across the other side, who will stand up to the Prime Minister, who will raise things in the caucus meetings.' But that is just a perception. I have now been disappointed by Senator Cameron. His latest foray in the caucus roomâ€”and it always manages to get into the newspaper, I should addâ€”was to pretend that he was standing up to the Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, and ask about this latest deal, the so-called Malaysian solution. Senator Cameron quickly, as it was rightly described, rolled over. I have worked Senator Cameron out. He is a big disappointment. I am going to have to find another hero on the other side now, in the limited time I haveâ€”but I will be watching on A-PAC.</span>

                  </a>  I have no respect! How is that? I just want to make this point before I get on to the substance of my address. On the night that Ms Gillard took over the prime ministership there was an adjournment debate in this House. I spoke on it and so did Senator Lundy. On that very night, or perhaps it was the night after, Senator Lundy came into this chamber and dripped with praise for the new prime minister, because she was all part of that plot. She was out for a promotion. Get her the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. It is disgraceful. It is terrible that anyone could be as greasy as Senator Lundy. Heaven forbid if that is how she treats her public office. And sheâ€”who does nothing in this chamberâ€”has the audacity to interject on me and say that I am just filling in time. Rubbish! You are the greatest filler I have ever met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gravity of this issue does require someone from the front bench, other than an interjector, to come in and speak on this issue. But they never do. They always leave it to the hapless backbench, who know nothing about what is going on. They were warned about the softening of the laws by the Labor Party in 2008. They were warned by their own department. Senator Evans was warned by the department that this would lead to a surge and he was warned by the Federal Police that this would lead to a surge. And that is exactly what happened. But due to the false piety of the other side trying to claim some delusional moral high ground, they maintain this soft policy. What is so moral, I ask themâ€”and I ask the next speaker to answer this questionâ€”about giving succour to the people smugglers? What is so moral about inducing people to cross the seas on treacherous journeys where many are lost? What is so moral about denying those in the detention camps, who rightly apply and queue up, their chance to come out to Australia? These are the true moral questions that those on the other side ought to address. You have a policy that is in shambles. You are in denial. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="e6c" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WORTLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  In rising to speak in this discussion can I first say that this matter of public importance was proposed by those opposite, yet we have had Senator McGauran stand here and waste eight minutes speaking about nothing. He would have had plenty of time to prepare if he had a case, but he does not have a case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike Senator McGauran, I welcome the opportunity to set the facts straight about what this government has done, and is doing, in the critical area of border protection and, importantly, to set the facts straight about the global context that has given rise to the displacement of people of many nations, some of whom are fleeing civil wars and the like to seek safe haven for themselves and for their families</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of unauthorised boat arrivals and irregular migration is not confined to Australia; it is a global problem which many countries around the world have been experiencing for some time now. These countries include Denmark, Sweden, Greece, Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, the United States, Austria, Norway and the United Kingdom. In March this year, the UNHCR released a report showing that during 2010 an estimated 358,000 people fled persecution in their homelands to seek asylum in industrialised countries. The total number of claims made in Australia remains well below levels seen in many other countries. It represents two per cent of total applications for asylum in the industrialised world, according to the report. In 2010, the main destination countries for asylum seekers were the United States, with 55,500 claims; France, with 47,800 claims; Germany, with 41,300 claims; Sweden, with 31,800 claims; and Canada, with 23,200 claims. In comparison, in Australia we received 8,250 claims, and these were largely from people coming from the most troubled and conflict-ridden regions of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: border protection is indeed a matter of public importance. This government has a long-held commitment to addressing the serious nature of people-smuggling activities and to targeting those criminal groups who seek to organise, participate in and benefit from people smuggling. For the record, the Labor government has devoted unprecedented resources to protecting Australia's borders and developing intelligence on people-smuggling activities. It has worked cooperatively with Australia's regional partners to disrupt people-smuggling ventures overseas, and we are subjecting people smugglers to the full force of Australian law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that people smugglers are motivated by greed and we know that they work in sophisticated cross-border crime networks. We know also that they have little regard for the safety and security of the people being smuggled, endangering their lives in unseaworthy and overcrowded boats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government believes the way to respond to what is a regional problem is to develop regional solutions. Irregular migration and people smuggling are global and regional problems that cannot be tackled by acting alone. These issues must be tackled in partnership with other countries. Under the Howard government, Australia took a unilateral approach. The Howard coalition government acted alone. It is a fact that genuine regional cooperation was never a prospect under the Howard government, and Senator McGauran knows that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting Australia's borders and airports from threats of terrorism, people smuggling, organised crime, illegal foreign fishing and the trafficking of illicit goods continues to be a top priority of the government. Those opposite know that the Labor government introduced legislation, including the Anti-People-Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, which reflects this. This bill ensures that people-smuggling activities are consistently and comprehensively criminÂ­alised and it makes it an offence to provide material support for people smuggling. It also equips our law enforcement and national security agencies with effective investigative capabilities to detect and disrupt people smuggling. It is just one example of the government's commitment to addressing the serious nature of people-smuggling activities and targeting those criminal groups who seek to organise, participate in and benefit from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced new measures as part of a regional cooperation framework that aims to put people smugglers out of business and prevent asylum seekers making the very dangerous journey to Australia by boat. The bilateral arrangement will take the form of a cooperative transfer agreement that will see asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by sea being transferred to Malaysia. In exchange, Australia will expand its humanitarian program and take on a greater share of the burden of responsibility for resettling refugees currently residing in Malaysia. The core elements of this bilateral arrangement will include a provision that 800 irregular maritime arrivals who arrive in Australia after the date of effect of the arrangement will be transferred to Malaysia for refugee status determination. In return, over four years Australia will settle 4,000 refugees already residing in Malaysia. Transferees will not receive any preferential treatment over asylum seekers already in Malaysia. Transferees will be provided with the opportunity to have their asylum claims considered, and those in need of international protection will not be refouled. So no-one who is transferred will return to their country of origin while their claims are being assessed or if they are found to be in need of protection. Transferees will be treated with dignity and respect in accordance with human rights standards. In addition, the UNHCR will be responsible for the processing of applicants involved in this process and a robust, independent advisory board will be established to oversee the implementation of the agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, today most of the world's refugees are living in countries that have not signed the UN refugee convention. In the case of Malaysia, there is agreement to abide by key parts of the convention. Australia and Malaysia are working closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration to operationalise the arrangeÂ­ment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the government's announcement, UNHCR regional represenÂ­tative Richard Towle said the scheme has the potential to improve the way the region manages refugee flows. In an interview published on the ABC online website, he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">â€¦ it's very important that this agreement is appropriately monitored and is seen to deliver not only outcomes for governments in terms of dealing with human smuggling and trafficking movements but also is seen to deliver improved protection for people in the region.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">make a significant practical contribution to what we're trying to achieve in the region.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">And if it's a good experience other countries can look at it and say yes, that's a positive way of managing these issues. Perhaps we want to embark on similar or other initiatives under a regional cooperation framework.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Towle goes on to say that there are significant differences between the current deal and the Howard government's Pacific solution. He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">This is an agreement, it's a bilateral agreement that has been negotiated within a broader regional cooperation framework with the involvement of UNHCR and the involvement of IOM â€¦ and we hope the involvement of other important actors as well, including non-governmental organisations.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">So it is an agreement between countries that are actively involved with refugee issues and both commonly face a refugee displacement problem.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Towle points out that the Howard government's push to house asylum seekers in countries without a refugee problem was about shifting responsibility. He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Australia was obviously looking at ways to divest itself of some of the responsibilities of dealing with refugees. The countries that were negotiated, Nauru and PNG at that time, did not have a refugee issue of their own and largely became places were Australia was able to manage its own protection responsibilities under the convention.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">So it was not a regional burden-sharing arrange</span>
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Â­</span>
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">ment at all. It was much more of a responsibility-shifting arrangement. And that's why we think they are not only philosophically but also in the way they were implemented they're quite different types of arrangements.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  The coalition supports the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. It essentially appropriates an extra year of funding for the Australian Research Council for the 2013 year as well as providing for indexation of the funding in the forward estimates. Other than that, the bill makes no substantial amendments to the ARC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is worth briefly giving some context to why research matters. Research is the engine of innovation, productivity and, of course, growth. In a modern advanced economy, research is essential to maintaining the edge over our competitors and improving the lives of Australians. Virtually every technology we use, every convenience we take for granted, has its roots in research. We might not see or think much about research, but its benefits are all around us. Spending on research is, quite simply, one of the best investments a government can make. In purely monetary terms, it produces a better return on every dollar spent than just about every other way the government can spend money. It advances human knowledge, produces countless direct benefits and spin-offs and, when commercialised, brings a wealth of benefits to our country, our economy and our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all fairness, I am starting to sound like my friend Senator Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, in expanding the benefits of research. In a sense I raise this because of mooted cuts to the budget of the National Health and Medical Research Council, the NHMRC. I know that Senator Carr and I am sure Senator Evans as wellâ€”being responsible for tertiary educationâ€”would agree with me that the funding of research is critical. It is a pity that the government is considering cutting those funds. I am hoping that Senator Carr, Senator Evans and others in the government that care about these things will make sure that Mr Swan and the bean counters do not get away with too much. I think it is fair to say that with research you cannot just cut it and then pick it up the next day, because when you cut it people leave, contracts are broken, relationships are destroyed and expertise often goes overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day I was at the well-named Menzies Research Institute at the University of Tasmania where they are doing great work in the areas of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. They have 150 researchers there and it is one of the Australia's great medical research institutes. I am really concerned about what might happen to that institute among others if those cuts that are being mooted in fact occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great interests of former Prime Minister Mr Howard was medical research. Senators will remember that, between 1995 and 1996 and up until the 2008 budget, the coalition provided a fivefold increase in medical research funding with funding increasing to about $700 million annually. It was one of Mr Howard's great passions. I was told when I was at the Menzies Research Institute that the then Prime Minister spent nearly an entire day at the institute looking at the projects and the medical research being undertaken at the University of Tasmania. That is a long time for a prime minister to spend in one spot looking at one particular project. To the coalition, this is very important research not just for the researchers in Tasmania but for the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the budget is being delivered tonight and I know there are financial constraints on the budget. I accept that and I think the country knows that. Suffice to say that cutting medical research at this time would be the wrong move because the benefits it brings to all Australians has great multiplier effects. I am hoping tonight that Mr  Swan does not take an axe to that. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

Its mission is to deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the community. In seeking to achieve its mission, the ARC provides advice to the government on research matters and manages the National Competitive Grants Program, a significant component of Australia's investment in research and development. Through the National Competitive Grants Program, the ARC supports the highest quality fundamental and applied research and research training through competitive selection processes across all disciplines, with the exception of clinical medicine and dentistry.</span>

Bills to amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to receive administered funding occur each year. This is to apply indexation to existing appropÂ­riation amounts, create an additional forward estimate and may also contain new funding for new initiatives. The current bill updates the special appropriation funding cap amounts administered by the Australian Research Council to include indexation adjustments to three existing financial year appropriation amounts and adds a forward estimate year in the Australian Research Council Act 2001. The bill adjusts the Australian Research Council's funding cap for the financial years beginning on 1 July 2010, 2011 and 2012 in line with indexation and sets the funding cap for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2013. Indexation adjustments and adding an additional forward estimate are part of the standard budget process and are administrative in nature. The proposed amendments change only the administered special appropriation; they do not alter the substance of the act or increase departmental funds.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ARC is the major source of funding for the innovative, investigator driven research that has underpinned inventions ranging from the bionic ear to the Jameson flotation cell which saves the coal industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year. ARC centres of excellence provide key science and policy advice on the management of coral reefs, are developing automated control systems for the mining industry and agricultural sector and are taking some big challenges in medicine such as applying nanobionics to regenerate spinal cord injuries. ARC funding has enabled regional centres such as the Cairns campus of James Cook University to attract Australian and international leaders in tropical rainforest ecology to build world-class teams of researchers and postgraduate students. Ongoing funding for the Australian Research Council is essential to the vitality of the Australian higher education system. Excellent researchers across all areas of the university system must be able to compete for funding if we are to keep world-class academics in Australia working in our universities and teaching the next generation. Since 2007 the Australian Research Council has delivered on our 2007 election commitment of 1,000 Future Fellowships. The Australian government will provide, over five years, up to $844 million and will award up to 1,000 of these midcareer research fellowships. The inaugural 200 future fellows were announced in September 2009 and a second round of 200 was announced in October 2010. Sixty of the fellowships announced last October identified environment and climate change as a target research area.</span>

This world-class research centre, hosted by the University of New South Wales, will receive $21.4 million over seven years. The centre's research programs will investigate the effects of tropical convection on Australia's climate; risks; mechanisms and attribution of changes in Australian climate extremes; the role of land surface forcing and feedbacks for regional climate; drivers of spatial and temporal climate variability in extratropical Australia; and mechanisms and attribution of past and future ocean circulation change.</span>

This is a world-leading research evaluation frameÂ­work reflecting the Australian government's commitment to a transparent, streamlined evaluation of the quality of research undertaken in Australia's universities. The Australian government has provided $35.8 million over four years. Since 2008 the ARC has undertaken three years of comprehensive and widespread consultation with the higher education research sector on the developÂ­ment of ERA. The first full round of evaluations for ERA took place in 2010. The ARC delivered the ERA 2010 national report on 31 January 2011. This landmark report highlights both Australia's research strengths and areas with potential for further development. It will allow the Australian government to plan the future of research investment in Australia. It provides assurance to government, industry and the Australian public of the quality of research conducted in Australian higher education institutions and the value of government investment in the research sector. For ERA 2010 the ARC received data in relation to some 330,000 unique research outputs and over 55,000 researchers.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I rise to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This bill has two main components, one being to effect a reorganisation of digital television channels to realise what is commonly referred to as the 'digital dividend', and the second being to deal with amendments to the regulatory framework which provide free-to-air television via the new VAST satellite service as part of the digital television switchover. The switch to digital-only television will make the present spectrum used for television in the analog space in the frequency ranges between 694 and 820 megahertz available for other uses. Beyond that is a capacity and opportunity to restack the spectrum used in the digital space, further making capacity available. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Spectrum is of course a valuable comÂ­modity, and I expect significant competition for this spectrum including from providers of superfast broadband, which we all know is increasingly the internet platform of choice for many Australians. This will of course provide a windfall of sorts to the government when that spectrum is allocated, auctioned or otherwise disposed of. I wish that I could say I have confidence that when this government receives windfall gains such as from the sale of spectrum it knows how to use the money wisely. However, I can but hopeâ€”given its history in pink batts, school halls or other areasâ€”that there is a change of government in place by the time the dividend in financial terms to government from this spectrum reallocation is made available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To enable this digital dividend, a more efficient organisation of broadcasting services spectrum is required, which will be overseen by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, otherwise known as ACMA, through a process, as I mentioned, known as restacking. This reorganisation requires amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act and Radiocommunications Act, which are presented in this bill. The coalition recognises the need to provide ACMA with the regulatory changes it needs to complete the restacking process effectively. However, as coalition senators outlined in their additional comments to the report of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 inquiry, the coalition does have some concerns in relation to the realignment of the broadcast licence areas. Before I move onto those concerns, I place on record my thanks to the members of that committee for their work in that inquiry and, of course, to the committee secretariat as always.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concerns raised by coalition senators in particular highlight the power that the amendments in this bill provide to the minister to direct ACMA to make or vary television licence area plans. These licence area plans, of course, set the boundaries into which different television broadcasters operate. While it is likely that there will be some change to licence areas, it appears the powers provided by these amendments offer, to some degree, free rein to the minister and ACMA in terms of those boundary changes, with few restrictions put in place. While I would not expect ACMA to just draw random maps for the sake of it, this is still a concern in terms of the lack of boundary and direction provided for in the bill. I also note that ACMA could allocate additional licences in some broadcast areas, potentially to significant industry players, which of course would come with a detrimental effect on existing broadcasters. In fact, in the Senate inquiry, the Department of BroadÂ­band, Communications and the Digital Economy testified that the bills contained:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these are important issues, and local stations with local programming content and local advertising provide a great community benefit and help to foster strong, vibrant regions. They are good for regional business, good for regional people and good for regional communities as a whole. While the legislation and these amendments that provide for this capacity may all be of good intention, sometimes good intentions go astray and there is nothing wrong, of course, with taking a precautionary approach in relation to such amendments. On this basis, I would invite the minister to provide some response to those issues raised by coalition senators and to provide some comfort in regard to the overall capacity of the minister and ACMA to exercise these powers in relation to the boundaries and the allotting of broadcasting spectrum.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the finalisation of the restacking exercise and to achieving the entire dividend, critically related to this is the switch-over itselfâ€”the switch-over from the analog signal to the digital signal, which has already taken place in parts of my home state of South Australia as well as parts of Victoria and Broken Hill. It is quite clear that the planning for the switch-over and preparation for it has--certainly in my experience dealing with parts of regional South Australia--been somewhat lacking. Hundreds if not thousands of people in the regional switchÂ­over area in SA are experiencing problems. They have contacted my office; I have spoken to them through media outlets and received their calls in many, many cases. We have written on many, many  occasions detailing dozens and dozens and dozens of particular examplesâ€”and  I am sure there are many more for all those who have contacted my officeâ€”in regard to problems people are having with the switch-over. Many of these problems remain and we are still getting new calls and inquiries some six months after the analog signal was switched off in parts of regional South Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the government seems to have failed to provide sufficient information to many households about how their antennas are set up and what things are needed for the switchover other than just getting the technology of a box or a new television in place. This failure has left them with poor or no television reception. In other cases there are technical reasons for why people are not getting the quality of television service that they previously enjoyed under the analog system. While Senator Conroy is well aware of my concerns in this area, I hope he is aware that these concerns are shared by many of my coalition colleagues, especially surrounding the preparation of further communities for the switch-over in regional areas. There is a real concern in many communities that not all current analog terrestrial transmission sites will be replaced with digital terrestrial transmission facilities. This, of course, will mean that many people who currently receive a terrestrial signal will have to switch to the VAST satellite service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's VAST satellite service programâ€”to cost some $375 million over 12 yearsâ€”replaces community funding models which allow communities to invest in self-help transmission or retransmission services that allowed them to access terrestrial facilities. The minister ought to be aware, and others have made these points, that of the 680 current self-help sites it is estimated that around 570 will not be upgraded to provide for digital retransmission. This will affect hundreds of communities in regional Australia and will see some 127,000 households move from a terrestrial television service to a satellite television service, losing the local connections and content which, as I highlighted earlier, are so significant and important for many regional communities. With another budget to come this eveningâ€”another budget, no doubt, of further waste and incompetence on the government's partâ€”you would think that Senator Conroy and the government might have paid some attention, and I can live in the hope that perhaps they have, to the views and submissions of the Local Government Association of Queensland, which stated in its submission to the exposure draft of this bill:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, moving from terrestrial to satellite television will not be a cheap exercise for taxpayers, households or, in particular, for many small businessesâ€”especially for retireÂ­ment homes, motels and caravan parks. Last week I was in Georgetown, in Northern Queensland, where the motel owners expressed their concerns about the expense of changing over from a terrestrial service that they currently have on a self-help basis to a satellite service that will cost them greatly to transform every room in their motel. With  no subsidy scheme for businesses, unlike for households, there is a real question for people like the motel in Georgetown as to how such businesses are to provide television services and, in doing so, fund the considerable cost of the new satellite equipment. Many simply will not be able to afford the expense or will see it as another hit to the bottom line, especially in the tourism industry, as well as for all those other small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an alternative that others have outlined, and that is that the government should move to allow communities to pool their VAST subsidies to pay for upgrades to their existing retransmission sites to a digital retransmission service. This would be a sensible win-win outcome for communities who would get to keep a terrestrial service and in many cases for many taxpayers who would actually save on cost. For instance, in Normanton, also in Queensland, some 552 households will be eligible for the $700 Satellite Subsidy Scheme, which, in addition to the householder co-payment of between $200 and $350, could total up to $600,000 in costs for Normanton households to access the VAST satellite system. Meanwhile, the minister himself has stated that setting up a digital terrestrial facility to retransmit all of the VAST channels would cost between $110,000 and $270,000. I think we can see in this example that there are opportunities to save money in relation to this switchover from the types of programs the government has proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, on the total cost for households, it is likely that in many instances the $200 to $350 co-payment ,which applies to upgrading only one household appliance, will not be enough given that we know many households have multiple televisions as well as recording devices, so this will be a considerable cost to households in those communities as well. Keeping a terrestrial signal in place wherever possible is simply good for communities, good for small businesses and good for tourism operators in particular. It is unfortunate that the government is not taking this approach and I would again urge the minister and the government more generally to reconsider and to look at ensuring, wherever possible, that it does support the maintenance of terrestrial facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities are not just concerned about the cost of the switch-over; many are also worried about the time they have to prepare. Broadcasters who have undertaken to convert existing analog transmission facilities to digital are required to do so six months before the switch-over date in any particular given region. This is to ensure that households have enough time to ensure that their digital reception equipment is working correctly. Without this time, many people are left with no TV services when the analog signal switches off. Indeed, my office has received calls from many people who, following the switch-off of the analog signal in South Australia, were left with no signal and felt they had little information about what to do to upgrade and in some instances had not had access to a digital signal so far in advance. In fact, the six-month rule was not observed in South Australia or in Mildura, and I would hope the government does ensure in future that it is observed in all switch-over areas in all cases. The six-month opportunity for people is important if they are to ensure that all of their equipment is working correctly before the switch-off occurs. It is simply not good enough and, as I indicated before, my office is still receiving many, many calls from South Australians receiving poor reception who really could have done with extra time to ensure their equipment was working before the switch-over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does recognise the need for the switch-over to digital-only television and we recognise this bill's role in this process. We do, however, implore the government to look at some of the measures I have outlined today that would enable more people to receive a terrestrial signal, would save taxpayer dollars and would ensure that people could continue to receive the terrestrial signal as well as ensure that those matters that have been debated in this place previously, such as the six-month rule for the switch-over, are maintained and observed by the broadcasters and by the government in the setting of the switch-over dates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition also recognises the importÂ­ance of local content wherever possible, and this is another reason why the opportunities of terrestrial services should be maintained. Overall we do not oppose this bill. We do recognise that it provides the necessary framework measures, particularly to achieve the financial dividend for taxpayers and the benefits of the spectrum becoming available for new technologies and new uses and to ensure that we get out of that public good of spectrum the best available return for all Australians in an economic sense, in a social dividend sense and also for taxpayers. We would urge the government, in relation both to how it manages that process and in particular to how it continues in managing the digital switch-over, to heed some of the concerns, to look for opportunities for cost saving and to show us that it is up to managing this process effectively into the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  I rise to add some comments on behalf of the Australian Greens, and I advise the Senate at the outset that the Greens will be supporting this bill. We have a number of concerns, which Senator Birmingham has outlined, and the concerns that we raise are very similar. I will give advance warning that I will be moving two second reading amendments that address in particular one of the issues that Senator Birmingham just raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the RadioÂ­comÂ­muniÂ­cations Act 1992. It has come in consequent to a process that we do support. The switch-over to digital television has been a long time coming. It has been delayed; it is probably running about a decade behind schedule considering when it was first proposed. It is appropriate that we are debating this legislation now with the process of the rollout where it is. The amendments introduce measures to effectÂ­ively implement the reorganisation of digital television channels, to realise the digital dividend and to improve the regulatory framework for free-to-air digital TV services provided on the VAST satellite service and the switch-over to digital-only television.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens welcome the government announcement that 126 megahertz of broadcasting spectrum will be released as a digital dividend. This dividend will be released as a contiguous block of spectrum in the UHF band in the frequency range of 694 to 820 megahertz. The spectrum will become available as a result of the switch to digital-only television and the release of spectrum currently used for analog television. Digital switch-over will be completed in Australia, we understand, if all goes according to plan, by 31 December 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have asked the government to estimate the overall revenue that will be raised by the auctioning of the digital dividend band, which of course is now an important and extremely valuable piece of taxpayers' property effectively. We have asked the government whether any sections of the band will be allocated for use by the emergency services or by other non-comÂ­mercial services. I missed the first few minutes of Senator Birmingham's speech. I am not sure whether this is an issue that the coalition have taken an interest in or not. The Australian Communications and Media Authority should be able to tell us the commercial value of the 20-megahertz spectrum requested by the Police Federation of Australia on behalf of emergency services organisations, and we think that this information would be useful as the debate unfolds with regard to who gets what in the digital dividend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the government is still considering whether or not to reserve part of the digital dividend in the 700 megahertz band for police and emergency services, and if so how that will be organised. I will indicate now I have a number of questions with regard to this issue and a couple of others, and that I will be proposing that we take this bill into the committee stage so that we can debate some of these issues with the minister. We want to put on the record that the Greens' view is generally supportive of the proposal that we understand came forward from the Attorney, Mr McClelland, that 20 megahertz or thereabouts be reserved for these public safety agencies because it is vital for the services that Australians need during natural disasters and other critical events such as terrorist incidents, bushfires and so on, and that there are particular technical reasons why emergency service organisations are requesting that particular band of that particular part of the spectrum. As I understand it, all of Australia's police commissioners support the Attorney-General's proposal, including the New South Wales commissioner, who is the spokesÂ­person on the matter, and the governÂ­ment's own chief commissioner, Tony Negus of the AFP, who in March 2011 told the ParliaÂ­mentary Joint Committee on Law EnforceÂ­ment how important access to that particular band is for police and emergency services workers. I understand the proposal is also backed by peak bodies representing fire authorities, ambulance services and so on across the country, and that the issue was raised at the February 2011 COAG meeting. So I suppose I am inviting at this stage the minister, if he is able to, to provide us with an update as to how that is going. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A hundred and twenty-six megahertz in the 700-megahertz range, the digital dividend, will soon be available for new users when Australia moves from analog to digital television, and of course police and emergency services are seeking 20 megahertz of that available spectrum, around 16 per cent of it. The remaining 84 per cent would then be available for auction to the big telecommunications carriers. I understand that there is resistance to the Attorney-General's proposal from the carriers and there has been a certain amount of debate in the public domain as to whether emergency services need that band, whether they are requesting something in the wrong place or whether it is irrelevant. Of course the carriers all want the available spectrum for commercial purposes, so they are just doing their jobs as well. I understand there is probably some contention even within the government, and maybe the minister can spell out for us what the views of the government are in this regard. I understand that the Attorney has a report from Access Economics which says that setting aside 20 megahertz of spectrum for natural disasters may not reduce the proceeds from auction because of the scarcity value of the spectrum, so in effect it decreases the amount that is available for bidding, which has been described as the waterfront property of radio spectrum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are essentially two alternatives to the Attorney's proposal. One is to insist that police and emergency services buy their communication services from commercial carriers. In effect, that means they would at this stage be reliant on Telstra, which is the only carrier in this space which has the reach that they need right across the country. This is the 'leave it to the free market' option that leaves our public safety agencies potentially at the mercy of Telstra, whose systems are not really built to importance level 1, which these services require for reliable, robust communications that survive natural disasters, to have that highest degree of network resilience that they obviously require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other option is to impose conditions on the commercial carriers which are successful in buying spectrum in this range at the forthcoming auctions. Such conditions would aim to ensure that the carriers meet the needs of police and emergency services, whether it be robustness, priority, security and so on. This approach was tried by the Obama administration in the States in 2008 and it failed because the carriers did not want to take on the onerous requirements that were necessary to meet the needs of first responders, quite understandably again. Their interests there are actually quite different. So subsequently President Obama reserved 20 megahertz for first responders in January 2011. They have rolled back in the US to the approach that the police and emergency services organisations are proposing here in Australia. If only mild conditions were imposed on the commercial carriers, the needs of first responders would not necessarily be achieved, and that is obviously something that they have great concerns about. We know the carrier systems regularly fail during natural disasters. Recognising that the NBN rollout will change the picture substantially, it is not going to change the underlying dynamic of the divergence of interests between the commercial carriers and emergency services personnel. So we believe that the Attorney-General's proposal probably has merit and is the only option that will ensure that police and emergency service authorities have the high-speed mobile broadband communicaÂ­tions that they effectively need in situations like natural disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that COAG has endorsed the need for these public safety agencies to achieve interoperability so as to protect the community in the range of circumstances that are foreseeable. I again give the minister notice now that I will be asking about that in the committee stage. This is a case obviously where the government's first priority, in our view, should be public safety and it should be the national interest rather than the interests first of the telecommunications carriers to maximise the value of the spectrum auction. I understand that a number of independent MPs are supporting the Attorney's proposal to reserve spectrum for natural disasters and other critical incidents. So we believe that public safety should come first and we are interested in pursuing the proposal to reserve spectrum for law enforcement agencies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We come now to the other area that we addressed during the Senate inquiry earlier this year, which Senator Birmingham touched on in his remarks. It goes partly to the issue of pooling the Satellite Subsidy Scheme. During the caretaker period last year a letter from the department said the following concerning pooling:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The subsidy will be provided by way of a procurement model under which contracted satellite installers will be engaged to provide the equipment and installations for eligible households. It will not be paid directly. Because of this it does not lend itself to pooling of payments. </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 15 November last year I wrote again to the minister suggesting again the concept of pooling the SSS payments.

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">I am also advised that pooling of the SSS funding in some areas could have the effect of increasing both the cost of the scheme to government and the copayment by individual households. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is becauseâ€”I am paraphrasing slightly hereâ€”of the model used maximising benefits from economies of scale that come from being able to contract for a specified number of households on a state-wide basis. If the number of households is reduced, the contractor's price might be expected to rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Environment and Communications Legislation Committee report of March this year shows in a bit of detail the objections and the counterproposals that were put in this matter by the Local Government Association of Queensland, Broadcasting Australia in particular and the Remote Area Planning and Development Board of Queensland, who took a particular interest in these issues. They provided responses within their submissions to the Senate committee as the same points were made by the minister in a letter of 9 December to the chairman of RAPAD. On the first point we believe that, just as the cabinet submission in relation to the scheme may have specified it being used only for DTH reception, so a subsequent cabinet decision could sensibly alter such a restriction if the arguments were made and if they were accepted. On the second point the department and the minister have said that such a procedure would distort the SSS scheme and result in higher copayment charges for the few remaining homes within the SSS VAST conversion structure. It is a reasonable argument, but we respectfully disagree. No bidder to an SSS tender can alter any quoted price on the basis of changes to the predicted number of homes regardless of the reason. This is reasonably well established. The exact wording from schedule 3, which is the pricing schedule for the required RFT response, says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The exact number of Registered Households that will participate in the scheme may be higher or lower (than outlined in the Schedule) â€¦ The list of locations participating in the scheme may also vary due to decisions by the broadcasters to, or not to, convert self-help sites to digital â€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So people coming into this process are well aware that the numbers of households can change. The second argument that the minister put to us in his letter does not actually hold water according to the documents. It is clear that broadcasters can quite freely decide to upgrade a self-help facility or not to upgrade one that they previously said they would at any time. The department does not seem to be concerned at this significant potential for a rise or fall in SSS participation and any effect on remaining homes. This already happened at Orroroo in regional South Australia after, we understand, the regional contract was signed with Skybridge. They lost more than half the predicted regional South Australian business. The same happened with Cohuna in regional Victoria. This town of 1,800 residents was removed from the department's scheme town list early in December 2010 after the broadcasters decided to upgrade the self-help transmitter at the end of November. We understand that that occurred after the contract with Skybridge had already been signed. Finally, we understand that total SSS business in regional Victoria is only running at about a third of the original predicted rate in the RFT documentation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pooling concept is fairly simple. Funds equivalent to the Commonwealth contribution for the relevant locationâ€”whether it be 400, 550, 700 or 980, depending on locationâ€”plus the manageÂ­ment fee which is paid to the contractor for every eligible home serviced multiplied by the expected eligible household numbers for the location would be handed to the relevant council. This is something that councils are requesting to at least have the option to be able to do. If the Commonwealth were concerned about such a transfer, it could certainly coordinate an RFT process for such self-help upgrades, resulting in the relevant councils or the local government association and the Commonwealth entering into a bulk contract for all such regionalâ€”but mostly remote Queenslandâ€”self-help upgrades. I think this is a good model that could be extended elsewhere. The relevant local council would be responsible for all the extra initial establishment costs and continuing maintenance and operational costsâ€”which is what the local government authorities up there are actually proposing. I understand that the LGAQ and RAPAD have been conducting tests of various digital terrestrial self-help technical models, the aim being to demonstrate, for example, a remote IndigenÂ­ous community self-help transmission model. Again, as Senator Birmingham outÂ­lined for the chamber, this is about retaining local programming and local terrestrial transmission. It is not about constricting choice or taking money off people making the government's life more complicated but about preserving the local broadcasters that people are used to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, once technical feasibility, bulk costs and ongoing maintenance are identified, the next issue will be: can we pool the contingent SSS to assist the initial rollout cost? The Greens believe there are justifiable concerns from those who have questioned the logic of requiring the 265-odd self-help licensees, involving around 460 facilities, to examine digital terrestrial self-help options during the period 30 March to the end of January 2011. It was impossible for such an examination to be undertaken when the equipment necessary for such endeavours was not actually available. So we note the department's comment during the inquiry that they are willing to accept the position taken by some councils in rural and remote areas who have said that they were opting for the subsidy but if they subsequently find that there is a better terrestrial solution which proves cost-effective they will be able to implement that and they would actually prefer to do that for their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens recognise that there has to be a mixture of solutions to get television to people across Australiaâ€”part of that being satellite, part of it terrestrial. The question, obviously, is how services can be delivered most effectively. These issues were very well canvassed in the committee report. We remain concerned, however, that some viewers may be forced to receive a VAST service in rural and remote regions before alternatives have been tested. We understand that government may consider lengthening the time frame for consideration of self-help solutions and application for the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a second reading amendment which calls on the government to do this and I will move that shortly. We also have another second reading amendment that calls for an independent review. We may have created a certain amount of confusion in calling for a review that will actually be conducted before the rollout has concluded by 2013. That is intentional. Because it is a phased rollout, we will have a great deal of operational experience and we will have a very good idea of how the process has worked for the earlier regions once they have been bedded down, which we think will be useful to be conducted during the rollout in later regions, particularly as we start getting into the big metro areas. So we have some concerns remaining about the impact that these changes will have on the community and we believe that a review on the impact of delivery of television services to viewers across Australia, but in particular to regional and remote areas, should be undertaken no later than 24 months after the legislation has been put in place, which, as I say, will probably bring us in some time before the rollout has concluded. That is actually intentional. I move the two Greens amendments:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  Firstly let me indicate on behalf of the government that it is our intention to oppose both of the second reading amendÂ­ments that Senator Ludlam is proposing. It is our view that the proposed amendments would not have any practical effect upon the bill nor any practical effect in terms of constraining or obliging the government to do anything. We see them as being of no effect and we will oppose them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summing up on behalf of Minister Conroy, firstly let me say thank you to all honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011. After its introduction in the House on 24 February 2011, the bill was referred to the Senate Environment, ComÂ­munication and the Arts Legislation ComÂ­mittee for inquiry, as Senator Birmingham touched upon. The committee tabled their report in the Senate on 21 March 2011 and it recommended that the bill be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 that are crucial to effectively implementing the restack of digital television channels needed to realise the digital dividend. On 24 June 2010, the government announced that 126 megahertz of broadcasting spectrum would be released as a digital dividend as a result of the switch-off of analog television services. The switch to digital-only television will be completed in Australia by 31 December 2013, releasing the channels used for analog television. The digital dividend will be released as a contiguous block of spectrum in the ultra-high frequency, or UHF, band. The UHF spectrum currently used for broadÂ­casting services is highly valued for delivering wireless communication services, including superfast mobile broadband. The government aims to auction the digital dividend spectrum in the second half of 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to release this highly valued spectrum, digital broadcasting services will need to be relocatedâ€”or, as Senator Fifield prefers, 'restacked'â€”out of the digital dividend spectrum and organised more efficiently within the remaining spectrum. The government intends that the digital dividend spectrum be cleared by 31 December 2014. While ACMA has some scope under its existing powers to commence digital channel restack planning, the bill would give it more flexible planning powers and allow the restack of digital television channels to occur in a timely and efficient manner. The proposed amendments will also improve the regulatory framework for digital switchover and the delivery of both terrestrial and satellite free-to-air digital television services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry of the Senate Environment and Communications LegislaÂ­tion Committee into the provisions of the bill, some submissions raised concerns that the bill favoured satellite conversion over terrestrial conversion. The government recognises that both terrestrial infrastructure and a satellite service are required to provide all Australians with access to the full range of digital television services. Government policy does not advocate a preferred method of digital television reception. I might also take this opportunity to respond to Senator Birmingham's concerns regarding regional Australia by simply saying that this government is very proud indeed to have finally brought to viewers in regional and remote Australia, through our switchover program and the launch of a new satellite service, access to the same number of digital television channels as people in the capital cities enjoy. This is a historic outcome for viewers in regional and remote Australia, who for decades have received less choice and arguably lower quality reception in their television viewing than people have in the capital cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend the conditional access scheme to provide commercial broadcasters in remote Western Australia with the opportunity to roll out their terrestrial digital television services before viewers they intend to serve can access the VAST satellite service. This will help to protect the integrity of the larger terrestrial television markets in remote Western Australia and avoids the need for viewers to purchase satellite reception equipment unnecessarily. The bill also proposes to allow viewers access to the VAST satellite service after a specified time after switchover in their licence area if it provides a superior number of commercial digital television services, including digital multichannels that are otherwise available terrestrially in their area. These provisions will provide the commercial broadcasters with the incentive to roll out all of their terrestrial digital television services before viewers in the area will be able to automatically access VAST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although commercial and national broadcasters can apply to the minister for exemption from converting terrestrial digital transmission sites under very limited circumstances, it is important to note that this exemption is not automatic. It is within the minister's discretion, having regard to the statutory criteria outlined in the bill, whether to grant a broadcaster an exemption. An exemption cannot be granted where a service has already commenced transmitting in digital. These provisions are intended to, amongst other things, minimise situations where consumers need to purchase both satellite and terrestrial reception equipment to receive the full suite of digital television channels. The bill will progress the government's digital television switchover program and will help realise the digital dividend, bringing significant social and economic benefits to all Australians. On behalf of the government, I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. I shall make it brief and try to cover both amendments at once. In relation to the amendment that I think we are considering firstâ€”that is, the one relating to self-help solutions and sites and the potential to be able to pool fundsâ€”this was an area that I spent some time discussing in my remarks during the second reading debate. The coalition are favourably disposed to support the motion of the Greens in that regard. We think that it makes a lot of sense, that it provides positive outcomes for communities in terms of increasing the scope of terrestrial services and has the opportunity to provide positive outcomes for taxpayers by minimising the amount spent on satellite subsidies. So I indicate our support in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the amendment relating to a review, which I think we will deal with subsequently, the coalition will not be supporting that amendment. I hope the government are in a process of, shall I say, 'continuous learning' with regard to the digital switchoverâ€”that is, that as problems are uncovered in each region, they actually learn the lessons and address them before the next region, and in particular address them before we get to the 2013 switchover of metropolitan areas around Australia. I do not know that a formal review part-way through the process is going to add to this. I think it is far more important for the government to actually be learning those lessons as they go, fixing it as they go and getting it right as they go. That is what the coalition would be urging them to do. Therefore we will not be supporting the amendment on sheet 7053 pertaining to a review.</span>

                    </a>  Then we can go into committee and we can leave these issues be. I thank Senator Birmingham for his support on at least one of these, as I think the issues that we were concerned about are subÂ­stantially pretty similar. It is about giving people time to make better arrangements, since they seem to be technically and economically feasible. I would invite the minister and maybe call him on his response when he spoke briefly to these amendments, sayingâ€”I am paraphrasingâ€”'You are not compelling us to do anything so these amendments are irrelevant.' I think that is a rather cavalier attitude to take to an amendment which I believe the chamber will shortly carry that 'the government should extend the timeframesâ€”as this amendment proposesâ€”for   consideration of self-help solutions and applications in subsidy areas of the SSS'. That is inviting the government to do something constructive.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have moved this in the form of a second reading amendment, and perhaps I should get it drafted as a committee amendment to compel the government to do exactly that. But I thought that, as a sign of goodwill, particularly with coalition support, a second reading amendment effectively advises the government that the chamber wishes it to take action in a certain way. I do not think we are asking anything unreasonÂ­able at all. It does not compel the govÂ­ernment to unpick the structure of the subsidy scheme. We are inviting the government to take another look at some of the constructive proposals that have been set forth by local government associations and Broadcasting Australia. I wonder whether the minister might indicate that the government would be prepared to take this amendment in the spirit in which it is proposed.</span>

As I comprehend it, the issue here is state and territory public safety agencies seeking an allocation of digital dividend spectrum as a means of meeting their wireless broadband capability requirements.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The options for the best way to achieve the new mobile broadband capability sought by public safety agencies areâ€”as you have touched uponâ€”being looked at by the Attorney-General's Department. Senator Conroy's department and the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, are of course assisting the Attorney-General's Department in that endeavour. In fact, a roundtable meeting was held only this morning, on 10 May 2011, and that meeting was attended by public safety agencies, industry and Commonwealth agencies. In factâ€”this is hot off the pressâ€”I can advise that that meeting was also attended by the Attorney-General and Minister Conroy. At that meeting, agreement was reached to establish a steering committee with repreÂ­sentatives from all interested parties to determine the best way to meet the spectrum needs of police and emergency services. This will involve ACMA working with police and emergency services to identify the appropriate spectrum to be reserved in the 800 bandâ€”which has been identified for public safety purposes in the harmonised band plans for the Asia-Pacific region. This is the appropriate and agreed process to address this issue, and I understand that there are no measures in this bill that in any way impede or otherwise affect that process.</span>

We are aware that people raised issues in relation to this legislation. We believe that there is some merit in ensuring that particular consideraÂ­tion be given to this issue, and that is why we moved to establish terms of reference on it for the Senate Environment and CommunicaÂ­tions References Committee, which is undertaking an inquiry into the capacity of communication networks and emergency warning systems to deal with emergencies and natural disasters. They are broad terms of reference that have the capacity to deal with a range of potential issues, but it is important to note that the terms of reference also include a capacity and requirement for the committee to look at new and emerging technologies, including digital spectrum, that could improve preparation for responses to and recovery from an emergency or natural disaster.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition sees this as an important issue. We are encouraged that the chamberâ€”including, indeed, Senator Ludlamâ€”supported us in ensuring that these terms of reference were passed through to the committee. We do think that it is critical that the concerns of those state and territory agencies as well as the concerns raised by many other groups about spectrum access for emergency services be heard and properly considered. We trust that the government, as part of their responsibility, will do that, and this chamber is already doing that through the Senate Environment and CommunicaÂ­tions References Committee. We think that that is an appropriate forum in which to air all of those issues properly and to ensure that, if the case for particular spectrum to be allocated is valid, the committee will make recommendations to the government for that spectrum to be allocated. We would hope that the government would look favourably upon such recommendations.</span>

You are quite correct: we did support that committee reference. I think it is timely and it is certainly a very good idea. But does not go to the heart of the issue that I am raising here, so I will perhaps put a question to the minister. I understood that what you told us just then was that the roundtable, or however you defined it, had convened to discuss the allocation of spectrum in the 800-megahertz rangeâ€”I think that is what you just saidâ€”which is not actually what they are asking for, and I wonder whether you would like to clear up that discrepancy before we move ahead.</span>

On the 400-megahertz band the government has already made significant progress through the COAG processâ€”which I think you touched upon, Senator Ludlam-to deliver an agreed national framework for improved radio communications interoperability. In April 2010, the ACMA announced arrangeÂ­ments for the provision of harmonised spectrum for use by government agencies in the 400-megahertz band. Under those arrangements, several segments in the 403-megahertz to 470-megahertz frequency range were identified for the exclusive use of government. That exclusive use is primarily to support national security, law enforcement and emergency services but is also available to support broader government use once those core requirements have been compreÂ­hensively met. Provision of this dedicated spectrum for emergency services requireÂ­ments in the 400-megahertz band will ensure interoperability of voice networks between different state jurisdictions. These arrangeÂ­ments complement the objectives developed by COAG under the national framework.</span>

They are seeking a 20-megahertz slice of that spectrum, which, as I understand it, for technical reasonsâ€”and this is obviously not my specific area of expertiseâ€”carries further. It is a better piece of spectrum for the kind of equipment that these people seek to operate in that it can penetrate buildings and so on and not be subject to rain, other weather conditions or that kind of thing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  That was a succinct answer. I am a little bit taken aback and surprised. I thank the minister for that. I again invite the ministerâ€”through you, Senator Feeneyâ€”to resume communications with some of the local government authorities and other agencies who have been working on pooling the SSS, because I think there is potentially a good outcome there for everybody. Would the minister like to briefly address the question that I raised right before I moved the amendment? It was about the govÂ­ernment's  attitudeâ€”and I certainly do not want to misquote the government's intenÂ­tionsâ€”to the second reading amendment that the chamber just passed.</span>

I think you quite accurately characterised those two amendments put by you, one of which was passed only a few moments ago, as an expression of the will and sentiment of the Senateâ€”and I think that is right. Those amendments do not amend the bill or impose any legal obligations on the government; rather, they are an opinion of the Senate expressed by the Senate.  As a consequence of that, together with the fact that I am advised that a second reading amendment for a bill has no consequences for the House of Representatives and is rather an expression of opinion by the Senate, I said something to the effectâ€”I cannot quite remember the phrase I used, forgive meâ€”that these amendments would have no effect upon the bill. That was really what I was saying. I guess I made the remark on those two grounds. I cannot quite remember my phraseology, forgive me, but I guess I said something to the effect that these amendments would have no effect upon the bill. That is really what I was saying. I hope that is of assistance.</span>

I wonder whether the government can offer a commitment, then, whether or not they will extend time frames for the consideration of self-help solutions and applications in subsidy areas of the scheme. That is effectively what we are asking. Your response is, 'We're not legally obliged to do anything, so we're feeling free to ignore it'â€”again, I am paraphrasing. Can you offer a commitment as to whether the will of the Senate will be respected in this instance?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FIFIELD:</span>
                    </a>  I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. The coalition's key concern when it comes to electoral legislation is that the integrity of the electoral roll is maintained and strengthened. This bill does neither of those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2006, the Howard government introduced legislation that required provisional voters to produce evidence of identity within seven days of a federal election or referendum. This legislation was introduced because the then government identified a loophole in the rules that surround provisional voting whereby the integrity of the electoral roll could be compromised by people enrolling in marginal electorates to influence the result in that seat, despite actually residing elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, with this bill, the government seeks to repeal the evidence of identity requireÂ­ments introduced by the coalition to ensure that the Australian electoral system is not rorted and to deter people from failing to comply with Electoral Act. This government wants to water down legislation that was introduced with the express purpose of strengthening the accuracy and integrity of the electoral roll, and the coalition will not support it in doing so. The coalition is opposed to any measure that would weaken the proof of identity requirements relating to provisional voting because it would remove an important deterrent that is designed to prevent voters from failing to maintain an accurate enrolment. Weakening proof of identity requirements will also remove an important measure that acts to deter those who may seek to engage in electoral fraud through multiple voting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's stated reason for this bill is that getting rid of the proof of identity requirements will mean that provisional votes will be treated the same as other classes of votes such as postal votes, pre-poll votes and absent votes. This, in the eyes of the Labor Party, is a good thing. That attitude, we believe, is misguided. Votes cast as provisional are provisional for a reasonâ€”often because the voter is not found to be on the roll or because two people present to vote under the same name.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In both these scenarios it is entirely reasonable to expect the voter to provide evidence of their identity. Without such evidence, the accuracy of the electoral roll is fundamentally compromised and the accuracy of election results could become compromised as well. If a voter is found not to be on the roll, it could be the result of their failure to maintain an accurate enrolment. If two people present to vote under the same name, it is clearly necessary and entirely appropriate for some proof of identity to be sought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To quote my coalition colleagues' dissenting report to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters 2007 report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Given that failure to properly maintain one's enrolment is a breach of the Act, it is not unreasonable for such persons to be subjected to a more stringent procedure to admit their vote, as a result of neglecting their responsibilities under the Act.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also not unreasonable for a more stringent procedure to apply before a vote is admitted for counting if two people are presenting to vote under the same name. The coalition believes that there must be consequences for people who fail to meet their obligations under the Electoral Act to maintain an accurate enrolment. If this bill passes through the parliament, there will be little incentive for people to uphold obligations surrounding their enrolment. If people have no incentive to maintain an accurate enrolment, then the integrity of the electoral roll as a whole will be comproÂ­mised. The number of people casting provisional votes has increased over the past recent years. Between 1994 and 2004 the number of provisional votes rose from 112,344 to 180,878. In 2007 nearly 80 per cent of voters who wanted to cast a provisional vote presented evidence of identity. In 2010, 96 per cent of people seeking to cast a provisional vote presented evidence of identity. The high rate of compliance with these regulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the coalition's 2006 legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to note that although 81.65 per cent of provisional votes were rejected in 2010, only 28,000 out of a total of 203,488 provisional votes lodged were rejected as a result of a failure to produce evidence of identity. That is under 14 per cent of provisional votes. The rest of the votes were rejected due to other issues that did not relate in any way to evidence of identity. And less than half of those 14 per cent of voters were subsequently found on the certified list. So this bill can hardly be supported on the grounds that the 2006 legislation resulted in the exclusion of a huge proportion of eligible voters from participating in elections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's position on the issues surrounding the electoral role has been consistent and justified over many years. The Liberal and National parties are committed to ensuring that electoral fraud is minimised and that the integrity of the electoral roll and electoral system are maintained and strengthened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2006 legislation which this bill seeks to repeal was introduced not for partisan political reasons but with the very best of intentions. The coalition sought to strengthen the electoral system's defences against reporting by those who may seek to multiple vote, and to reinforce the integrity of the electoral roll. This bill, by repealing the proof of identity requirements currently in place for those who wish to place a provisional vote will leave the electoral system open to manipulation, and will compromise the integrity of the electoral roll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely appropriate that a voter's failure to maintain an accurate enrolment as per the obligations under the Electoral Act result in them being subject to a slightly more stringent process. And the experience of the last election has shown that 96 per cent of those who seek to place a provisional vote do not find it to onerous a task to have to produce identification when presenting at the voting booth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition will support measures that allow the electoral roll to be maintained as accurately and truthfully as possible. But the coalition will continue to oppose any measures that will weaken the deterrents to fail to comply with the Electoral Act. This bill does exactly that, and will likely damage the integrity of the electoral roll. As such, the coalition will be opposing this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. This bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, the bill will repeal the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of their identity before the votes are admitted to preliminary scrutiny. As senators in this place would be aware, a provisional vote is a type of declaration vote cast by an elector at a polling place on polling day. Like all declaration votes, it is a vote that is sealed inside an envelope. After this, the elector's details, including name, address, date of birth and signature are written on the outside of the envelope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four main reasons an elector may be required to cast a provisional vote: the elector's name cannot be found on the certified list, the elector's name is marked on the certified list indicating that the elector has already voted, the polling official has doubts regarding the elector's identity or the voter is a registered silent elector whose address does not appear on the certified list. Currently, the Electoral Act determines that an elector who casts a provisional vote must provide a polling official with proof of identity at the time of voting, or to the Australian Electoral Commissionâ€”the AEC officeâ€”by the first Friday following polling day. If the proof of identity is not provided by the deadline, the envelope containing the ballot paper is excluded from the preliminary scrutiny and is not counted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Special Minister of State, the Hon. Gary Gray MP, rightly points out, this requirement was put in place by the previous government in 2006. It resulted in a situation where provisional votes were dealt with in a way that was inconsistent with the treatment of other kinds of declaration votes, namely, absent, postal and pre-poll votes. This legislation will repeal the proof of identity requirement and ensure that all declaration votes are treated equally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will replace the proof of identity provision with a test which has been used in previous elections. The test which has been previously used is conducted by the divisional returning officerâ€”the DRO. The DRO compares the signature on the provisional vote with the signature of the elector on their previously lodged enrolment form if there are any queries about the identity of the elector. Currently, the requirement for only provisional voters, and not other categories of declaration votes such as absent, postal and pre-poll, to provide proof of identity leads to inconsistencies in the treatment of different types of declaration votes. Essentially, the current arrangement means that an elector who is eligible to vote, and who only has a provisional vote rejected at preliminary scrutiny because of failure to provide evidence of identity would have their vote counted if they had instead voted by absent vote, postal vote all pre-poll declaration. There is no reason why otherwise valid provisional votes should be treated differently to other forms of declaration voting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a provisional vote can be cast in a referendum, this bill also amends the referendum act to be consistent with amendments made to the Electoral Act. At the 2007 federal election over 27,000 provisional votes were rejected at preliminary scrutiny because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the first Friday following polling day. At the 2010 federal election over 28,000 provisional votes were rejected for the same reason. There are a number of reasons why electors may not provide proof of identity by the first Friday after the election. One reason is that electors may not be motivated to provide evidence of identity because the result of the election is already known. It does not necessarily indicate an attempt by electors to fraudulently vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AEC has undertaken further examination of the 28,000 provisional votes cast at the 2010 election and identified 12,000 instances where the name of the voter was subsequently found on the certified list. So these people were in fact eligible voters, highlighting that the 2006 amendments are simply unworkable. What we are doing in this bill is making an amendment to restore the custom and practice of dealing with provisional votes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Electoral Commission has provided support for this amendment bill through their submission to the current inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election. The AEC has recommended that the requirement for production of evidence of identity by provisional voters should be repealed. The AEC believes that details provided by the elector on the outside of the envelope, such as the voter's name, address, date of birth and signature, allow the Electoral Commission to determine the voter's eligibility to have their vote included without the requirement for additional proof of identity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we pass this measure to avoid inconsistencies with other forms of declaration voting. This is to ensure that our electoral system supports all eligible voters having their votes counted. This legislation clears up the unworkable 2006 amendments by repealing the proof of identity requirement for provisional votes and ensures that all declaration votes are treated equally. This is an amendment, as I have said, that is recommended by the AEC. I would urge all those opposite to support this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recap exactly what this bill seeks to do because the opposition, as I understand it, will not be supporting this piece of legislation. I ask that they go back and have a look at exactly what the legislation seeks to do, and that is to increase the franchise. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 will repeal the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity before their votes are admitted to preliminary scrutiny so that they are treated no differently to absentee votes and other declaration type votes. The bill also will implement recommendation 2 of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the conduct of the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto, which has been tabled. This measure was also one of the federal Labor government's 2007 election commitments. This piece of legislation delivers on that commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, we have an election commitment that this bill seeks to deliver on, we have the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommending it in their 2007 report and we have the AEC suggesting that this provision needs to be repealed. As I said earlier, of the 28,000 votes that were set aside from the 2010 federal election, 12,000 were found, after a check on the certified roll, actually to be on the roll. That result is not particularly surprising, as a polling official will put the vote in an envelope if they have any doubts, as people in this chamber well know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no real reason for us to treat this type of declaration vote any differently to other types of declaration votes. It is well known on this side of the chamber that these amendments were put in the act in 2006 for political reasons. It was a decision by the then Howard government to make it as hard as possible for people to cast a valid vote, for people to have their democratic say in an election. What this says to people is, 'If you are left off accidentally or the polling official just cannot find your name then we are going to place more onerous task on you than we would on any other elector.' We say to them: 'We will put your vote in an envelope. We will take your name, address, date of birth and then we are going to set that aside and you have until the Friday following the election to come down and show us proof of identity that you are indeed this person.' It is something we do not do for any other type of declaration vote.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:02</span>):  On 6 March this year, I had the opportunity to visit McMullen Abbeyfield House in Huonville in southern Tasmania for its 10th birthday celebrations. McMullen Abbeyfield House, in Huonville, is part of Abbeyfield Australia, which is the peak national body that represents 26 affiliated Abbeyfield associations. Across Australia, there are 23 Abbeyfield houses and three hostel aged care facilities. These facilities are located in Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland. Tasmania has five Abbeyfield houses, with the others being in Burnie, Launceston, Chigwell and Glenorchy. Tasmania is certainly well represented in Abbeyfield houses, given the state's small population, but bearing in mind the percentage of the population over 65 this is possibly not surprising. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">McMullen Abbeyfield House is a group home that encourages independent living in a supportive environment. Residents come and go as they please, retaining their indepenÂ­dence and personal interests, but they have the company of others if they choose to socialise in shared areas of the home. McMullen House has a wonderful vegetable garden and many fruit trees. Many of the residents enjoy harvesting the wide variety of vegetables and fruit grown and also cook and preserve much of the produce. Indeed, I was quite envious of the many preserve jars on the wall unit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The residents have a real sense of pride and belonging in their home. They have a housekeeper and are provided with home-cooked meals. The residents tell me the food is wonderful, and if they want to cook they are encouraged to do so. I think this is one of the aspects that makes the facility a real home for many: the fact that they can make a cake, cook a dinner or just be in the kitchen with the housekeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Costs are met by residents paying 70 per cent of the base pension plus 100 per cent of their rent assistance to Abbeyfield. Payments cover food, accommodation, cleaning, materials and power, plus a gardener for those bigger gardening jobs, and rates on the building. If family visit and wish to stay overnight, there is a guest room, and family and friends can stay for meals, both at small cost. This is a real sense of home; it is not at all institutionalised. There is a real sense of warmth and personality, and the residents really enjoy the mix of independence, while still feeling supported. A couple of the residents told me it was the best move they had ever made. McMullen Abbeyfield House was largely funded by a private estate. Land and the equivalent costs of seven rooms and en suites were included. The remaining three rooms were funded by the state government and the normal public housing eligibility criteria apply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another Abbeyfield House, in the northern suburbs of Hobart. Abbeyfield Glenorchy was developed with funding under the Local Government Community Housing Program, and a contribution from the Commonwealth government, at the time the Keating government. The CommonÂ­wealth government funding came in the form of two separate grants, $440,000 in the 1992-93 financial year and $40,000 in the 1993-94 financial year. This project was also greatly supported by Rotary, Lions and the Trust Bank Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am mentioning Abbeyfield Glenorchy, I would like to congratulate the five people who were awarded life membership of Abbeyfield Glenorchy Inc. for their service last year. They are Mrs Anne Gunn, Mrs June Flood, Mrs Merle Diakovsky, Mr Max Maynard and Mr Leo Hurst. Mr Hurst is also a director on the Abbeyfield Australia board. He is joined there by fellow Tasmanian David Kay, who is the national treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abbeyfield's focus has been providing assisted group housing for Australians aged 55 and over. However, there is now also accommodation for people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. This change in direction has occurred as a result of need in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abbeyfield Australia is part of a worldwide movement with 18 countries using the concept of group housing, which began in the United Kingdom in 1955. The concept came about when Richard Carr-Gomm volunteered his services to help elderly people needing practical assistance and companionship. Mr Carr-Gomm went further than just being a helper and companion. He purchased a house, made it available for people to live in and became the housekeeper, although this was only for a very short time. Mr Carr-Gomm then founded the Carr-Gomm Society, which operated on the same principles. Abbeyfield in Australia began in 1986 with a home in Melbourne. Other countries using the concept include Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jersey, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, the United States of America, and an associate member, Mexico. At present more than 9,000 people live in 850 Abbeyfield houses worldwide. Abbeyfield Australia is a registered not-for-profit company and registered charity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national peak body advocates for all Abbeyfield houses and helps to maintain a management and support framework for all associations. This includes providing: legal and governance advice; national repreÂ­sentation and advocacy; planning, building design and project management; a national framework of policies and operational procedures; a comprehensive suite of tarÂ­geted insurance policies; affiliation and manÂ­ageÂ­ment agreements; ongoing operational guidance; and collegial support and volunteer networking opportunities</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abbeyfield Australia understands that Australia's demand for affordable housing will continue to increase at a rapid rate as the 'baby boomer' generation ages. They also recognise that group living is a highly cost-effective way in which to provide quality community based accommodation. Abbeyfield Australia has both the capacity and the experience to assist in meeting the demands of the nation's changing population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each Abbeyfield house is managed by a local incorporated association with its own volunteer committee of management. The local association must manage the house in line with the Abbeyfield Australia govÂ­ernance principles and procedures. The association is responsible for: compliance with tenancy legislation and food safety standards; induction and continuing liaison with residents; employment of the live-in housekeeper; budgeting and financial management; and consultation with residents on both an individual and a house level</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Abbeyfield Australia is hopeful that it will be able to help meet the demands for affordable and cost-effective community housing. Abbeyfield believes its expertise and community volunteer commitment, combined with financial support from the Australian government, can deliver good outcomes in an economically responsible way. Once built, there is no need for ongoing financial support from government as all operational costs are met through the rent. The Abbeyfield business model allows for consistent outcomes while maximising local community involvement and ownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each Abbeyfield house has room for 10 residents with each having their own bedroom with ensuite and tea and coffee facilities. Shared areas of the house include lounge and dining areas, a laundry and an outdoor area. When I was at Abbeyfield House in Huonville each room had its own little outdoor area and many of the residents had tables and chairs where they could relax with family. As mentioned, a housekeeper provides nutritious meals and the maintenance and house costs are covered by the local association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important things about an Abbeyfield house is that they are designed to feel like a home and not like an institution or facility. Abbeyfield residents experience many benefits, which may include: affordable, supportive, safe and long-term secure accommodation; greater indepenÂ­dence for older residents; an opportunity for people with disability to move out from their parents' home; enhanced social relationships and companionship; increased community participation; and the lessening of isolation for those people who live in isolated areas. They also allow people to stay within the area they have grown up in. That was a great benefit at the Huonville home I visited. There is also additional opportunities to access work, especially for residents with disability. It eases the burden on family members who have been previously caring for the resident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe Abbeyfield is a great concept in that it provides affordable housing as well as allowing residents to live independently while still receiving support when needed. Abbeyfield Australia has developed a strategic plan for 2010 to 2015 and it has set a target of having 46 households across the nation by the end of that period. With that many houses, about 650 people will be living in Abbeyfield accommodation. Further to this, by 2025 it is envisaged Abbeyfield Australia will have more than 100 properties accommodating approximately 1,300 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would point out that Australia has approximately 522 local government areas. If there were just one house in each local government area that would accommodate more than 5,200 people. That is certainly something worth thinking about.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARNETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:12</span>):  I stand tonight to speak to a matter of serious concern relating to the professionalism, or lack of it, of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen. On 4 April the minister, on behalf of the Labor Gillard government, caved in to coalition pressure and overturned Labor's ban on the distribution of Bibles and other holy books as gifts at citizenship ceremonies. Labor's changes to the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code in 2008 specifically banned the giving of Bibles and other holy books as gifts at citizenship ceremonies. That was confirmed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in answers to questions on notice that I put in October last year and again in the Senate in February. The ban was also accepted by the relevant minister in this place, Senator Kim Carr, in answer to a question I asked. He even tried to blame it on the Howard government. But we see that, as of 4 April, Minister Bowen tried to pretend that there was never a ban at allâ€”both ministers directly conflicting with each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The serious concern I have relates to the lack of a response from the minister, Chris Bowen, to correspondence I forwarded to him on 28 October seeking clarification of the matter following Senate estimates in October. I wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Minister</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am writing to seek clarification on the current confusion surrounding the status of Bibles as "gifts" under the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code. I refer also to recent communications I have had with the Bible Society of Tasmania who have serious concerns. I seek your confirmation that Bibles have not beenâ€”and will not beâ€”banned at citizenship ceremonies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I never received a response to that letter. On 12 January I followed up in a courteous way in another letter. I wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to my previous correspondence dated October 28, 2010 addressing the confusion surrounding the status of Bibles as "gifts" under the current Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As at the date of this letter no response has been received. Your early response would be greatly appreciated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And still no response. On 28 March, there was still no response. So what do I do? I write to the Prime Minister, the Honourable Julia Gillard, and ask her to take up the matter with her cabinet colleague Minister Chris Bowen. As of today, Tuesday, 10 May, there is still no response from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If they are treating a senator, a fellow member of the federal parliament, in this way, how are they treating members of the public? With disdain and contempt, no doubt. The lack of a response from this minister is outrageous. It is not only patronising and demeaning; it is condescending, disrespectful and downright insulting. For the minister not to provide any response in any way, shape or formâ€”either via an email, a hard copy letter or a telephone call from his officeâ€”is not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I raise this in the Senate is that this parliament is meant to have some sort of standards. There is meant to be some sort of ethic to the way that they deliberate. Clearly it is not good enough. I raised it with the Prime Minister on 28 March, and here we are early-ish in May and there has still been no responseâ€”absolutely nothing. If they are treating a fellow member of the federal parliament in this way, how are they treating members of the publicâ€”with the same level of disdain and contemptuous behaviour? That is a question I pose, and it remains to be answered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would the minister not respond? Clearly, there is a conflict in understanding with respect to their views on whether or not there was a ban. Clearly there is a conflict between Senator Kim Carr and the minister. It is on the Senate <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. He put out a media release in early April, indicating that they overturned the ban. He did not use those words; members of the public have used those words. Indeed, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury </span>newspaper used those words. Their headline on that day, 5 April, was 'Unholy row ends as bibles stay'. I congratulate Bruce Mounster for writing that report, which read as follows:</span>

                  </a>  Is it typical, Senator Humphries? If so, that is very disappointing, but I am not surprised. I would ask those on the other side in this chamber to take it up with the minister and ask, 'Why haven't you responded? Are you treating fellow members of parliament with disdain and contempt in the same way you treat members of the public?' That question has been asked. Two letters have been sent. It was raised in Senate estimates. I have raised it a third time in writing to the Prime Minister. Nothing has happened.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in the few moments I have remaining, I would like to pay a special tribute tonight to the world champion from Launceston, Tasmania, Daniel Geale. He is known as the 'real deal'. He was born and bred in Launceston. He studied at Brooks High School in Launceston. He has stunned the world by becoming a world champion, winning the International Boxing Federation middle-weight crown in Germany, just a few days ago. It was Sunday the 8th, and it was reported widely across the nation and in particular in the Tasmanian media. I thank the media there, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Launceston Examiner</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> for giving him the appropriate recognition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was against the odds, it was in Germany, it was against a German and it was in front of a parochial crowd. He is only 30 years old and he still has a very long way to go. He is now a world champion. I say congratulations to Daniel Geale, to his team, to his family. Congratulations and well done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly note the comments by Graeme George, his trainer, who had trained him as a young boy in Launceston. He said that he would like to make the first defence of his IBF middle-weight crown in Tasmania and has urged the state government to get behind the state's newest world champion to make sure that it happens. I want to support that call and call for the state government, the Labor government in Tasmania, to try and wriggle out of the despair and dismay that it is in at the momentâ€”the wrecking of the Tasmanian economy, the trashing of the budget and the sacking of thousands of Tasmanian public servants and othersâ€”and just for a moment to grab hold of this wonderful opportunity, get behind it and support this event, so that the defence of this title can take place in Tasmania.  It would do wonders not just for tourism and not just for the people who would attend such an event, but Tasmania would be the eyes of the world. The international media and teleÂ­vision would be focusing on Tasmania for such an event. I hope that other members and senators in this place and those in Tasmania as well will get behind this push to make sure that Daniel Geale can defend his IBF title in Tasmania. Wouldn't that be just fantastic? Wouldn't it just be so good?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that it is beamed all around the world. It would be a big confidence boost for Tasmania in terms of the hosting of events. There are a whole range of different sporting events but this would be one of the biggest opportunities, and we should grasp it with both hands. I call on the state government to get behind this call, make it a success and give Daniel Geale the honour that he deserves. I thank the Senate.</span>

                  <a href="GB6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:22</span>):  Following Mothers Day, I want to speak this evening about the privilege I had recently to be in a roomful of true 'supermums' while presenting the Victorian Mother of the Year award, hosted by Barnardos. Being a Victorian senator is indeed a privilege and a role that I relish, but being a mum is an even greater privilege and a role I delight in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested to read in the papers recently about Gail Kelly, the Westpac boss, speaking about how she used to cope when she had four children under the age of threeâ€”triplets amongst them. One of Australia's most successful businesswomen, Mrs Kelly revealed that she briefly checked one of her babies into the paediatric ward of a local hospital so that she could get some sleep. Mrs Kelly admitted to once getting caught up in a business call on her car phone and totally forgetting that she was supposed to be taking her young son to school. She pulled into her work car space only to hear a little voice in the backseat saying, 'Mum, have you forgotten about me?' Another time, neighbours complained about the noise from her little girl, because the girl's screaming was interfering with their plans to have some drinks in their garden. Noting that the noise had actually stopped, Mrs Kelly told them, 'Don't worry, I just killed her.' As we all know, it pays to have a sense of humour as a mum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great privilege to celebrate the fact that mothering bonds many of us. We may not earn Mrs Kelly's salary and we may not have smashed the glass ceiling in the way that she has, but what we have in common is more powerful than any of that: our kids, our shared experiences as mothers, and doing the best we can, day in and day out. Whilst Mrs Kelly said she was uncomfortable with the term 'supermum', I am notâ€”particularly when I had the pleasure of being among so many of them at the Barnardos functionâ€”and it is these mothers that I think we can and should celebrate. This is the 16th year of Barnardos hosting the Mother of the Year awards, and I am thrilled that they celebrated the achievements of mothers and their contributions to our community. As we all know, there is no way we could put a figure on everything that mothers do. What is important is that we continue to highlight how vital mothers are at every stage of life and that we continue to promote and support motherhood. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say a few words about a debateâ€”some call it a 'war'â€”that I had hoped had been settled long ago; but, unfortunately, it is still alive and well today. That is the 'battle' between the stay-at-home mum and the working mum. I noticed recently an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> with two pictures: one of a stay-at-home mum, surrounded by her kids, and the other of a working mum at her desk. The story revealed that a new survey had found that mums feel stigmatisedâ€”whatever they do! Worst of all, other mums are the biggest offenders for making them feel bad about their choices. Almost 60 per cent of working Mums were made to feel that they were not taking parenting seriously enough, while 40 per cent of stay-at-home mums experienced negativity about their decision not to be in the paid workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, radio presenter Jackie O said that debate about her returning to work two months after giving birth made her feel like a second-rate mum. One Melbourne mum set up a parent-support website after other mums called her 'evil' for putting her three-month-old son into child care so that she could return to university study.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is going on here? Why have mothers declared war on each other? Since when did we rate mums as first class, second class and so on? Why did we go tribal, forming into camps, defending our territory and throwing spears at others who have made decisions different to our own? At the risk of using a clichÃ©, surely we should focus on the things that unite us rather than those that divide us. In fact, many mothers do different things at different stages of their family processes. As I said earlier, our common bond is our kids, and what a powerful bond that is. We need each other's help and support more than ever. Surely we can rise above this divisiveness, because it really is sowing guilt and creating real harm where we should be offering encouragement and support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was not particularly interested in whether the three Barnardos finalists in Victoriaâ€”Sharon Bailey, Dianne Brown and Shirley Iaconisâ€”were stay-at-home mums or working mums because, really, that does not matter. Having said that, I do believe it is crucial that babies have the opportunity to bond with their parents, particularly their mothers, in those vital first months and years. That is why I am so pleased and proud to be part of this government that has established Australia's first paid parental leave scheme to support that. What matters most of all for our children is their safety, their care and their happiness. What also really matters is whether our mums have received the love and support they have needed along the way, and still need, because the job of mothering never ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my sincere hope that mums can stop beating up on each otherâ€”stop the snide remarks and judgmentsâ€”and unite under the banner of motherhood, declaring loudly and proudly that we are mothers first. I also hope that we can create a culture where we celebrate and genuinely support all mothers, not just those who fit our personal definitions. That also means reaching out to other groups of more marginalised mumsâ€”like teenage mothers, who are often unfairly judged and treated, like single mothers and any mum you know who is struggling, for whatever reason. Haven't we all struggled at times?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I read with interest the profiles of the three Barnardos Victorian finalists, and one thing they all share is their positive outlook and their selfless, gutsy attitudes as well as their genuine desire to help others and to put others' needs before their own. I really was inspired by their stories. The world is a much better place for having Sharon Bailey, Dianne Brown and Shirley Iaconis in it, and I salute them for their courage and comÂ­mitment as mothers and carers of a broader family network. I also congratulate Barnardos Australia's 2011 Mother of the Yearâ€”Rebecca Healy, from the Northern Territory. At just 25, the mother of two has really turned her life around. After leaving home at 12, Rebecca lived in refuges for seven years and was taken in by friends. At 19, she decided to clean up her actâ€”which included buying her first home and losing 50 kilos. As well as being a single mum to her two boys aged four and three, Rebecca also cares for her 16-year-old sister full time and is an emergency foster parent. She works as an Indigenous economic development officer and is a passionate advocate for local youth. What an inspiration for young woman and mothers. I read recently that children are happiest when their mothers are happy. But, according to the research, when their mothers were unhappy, only 55 per cent of youngsters were satisfied with their home life. Interestingly, the study found that a father's happiness makes no real difference to his offspring. What this tells meâ€”as if we needed research to prove itâ€”is that kids need happy mothers. As Rebecca Healy puts it, 'a happy healthy mum equals happy healthy children.' While on some days as mums we don't feel particularly happy, I know that most of the time mothers make tremendous efforts to be happy for our kids. Everything a mother does is for her kids: to ensure that they are happy and healthy and to ensure that their family life is strong and stable. I was delighted to present the Victorian Mother of the Year Award and to speak about a subject I am passionate aboutâ€”that is, that we should do more to promote motherhood.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8O6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (20<span class="HPS-Time">:31</span>):  Tonight I take the opportunity to speak about the Senate Economics References Committee's recently completed second interim report on its inquiry into the impacts of supermarket price decisions on the dairy industry. Even though I will not be around for the conclusion of that inquiry in the second half of this year, I have been around for a considerable part of the history of the dairy industry's experience of deregulation, including the process of the states agreeing to deregulate their industries back in 1999. It was at that stage a policy was put forward by the leaders of the dairy industry and it was ultimately supported by the government and the opposition, even though there was a Senate inquiry at the time regarding deregulation in the course of which a number of important findings were made. One of the findings was that there was a risk that , in the process of deregulation, the supermarkets might seek to capture more of the value of the dairy industry than they had hitherto, at the expense of the dairy industry. How true that protection turned out to be!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arising from that process, the govÂ­ernment, with the support of the opposition and at the request of the industry, implemented a process of levying consumers to supply money which would go to assist in the restructuring of the dairy industry. So, for every litre of milk that consumers purchased, they paid 11c towards that levy which, until it was abolished in 2008, raised $1.8 billion. Consumers paid $1.8 billion towards the rearrangements in the dairy industry, including payments to farmers to leave the industry and payments which allowed farmers to re-equip their dairy operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The price that farmers are paid for milk has often been at issue between farmers and dairy processors of varying sorts. It has often been the subject of conflict and consternation for farmers. Of course, the fresh milk industry was the key focus of the deregulation process because that was the part of the dairy industry that was regulated in states such as New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia . In those states, the production of milk was much more dependent on regulation than it was in states such as Victoria which, of course, produces over 60 percent of the milk produced in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to note that, well after deregulation had occurred, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Tim</span>es recorded in an article of 20 February 2009 that the cost of milk to processors had risen in the previous year by 12c to 15c a litre, yet supermarkets were only paying processors another 9c a litreâ€”less, in fact, for their privately branded product, and this has been the subject of great consternation in recent times. So at all times since deregulation there has been a testy relationship between processors and the supermarkets as to the price processors were paid for their milk, yet at some times dairy farmers have done much better than they have been doing in recent years, particularly as, immediately before the global financial crisis, dairy farmers around the country were being paid much higher prices than they were at the beginning of deregulation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the period since deregulation we have seen the emergence of two markets for dairy farmers in this country: the marketsâ€”the states of Victoria, Tasmania and South Australiaâ€”in which the dairy industry relies upon exports for the bulk of their production and the marketsâ€”the states of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australiaâ€”in which the dairy industry relies on the production of drinking milk. Over the period since deregulation, a significant difference between those states has emerged in the price paid to dairy farmers for their milk. For example, in the last recorded figures, as set out on page 37 of the committee's recently released draft interim report, the price in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia was 33.9c, 34.6c and 34.6c per litre respectively; whereas in Western Australia it was 42.4c, in New South Wales it was 48.7c and in Queensland it was 55.8c. In Queensland, the differential had gone up to 65 per cent higher than the price in Victoria, which is one of the states producing milk for export.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the interim report there were dissenting comments by Senators Xenophon, Heffernan, Milne and Williams in which they suggest that a floor price should be implemented for domestic drinking milk supply as an urgent interim measure. Nothing further has been suggested about a price or how that mechanism would work, but essentially what those senators are urging is a return to regulation for the dairy industry after consumers paid $1.8 billion to move away from it, at the urging of the dairy industry and with the support of the states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not believe that this country ought to or will return to a regulated price for milk. The fact is that the bulk of the milk produced in this country is produced in states which predominantly export. Those states' farmers will be paid prices which have regard to the international price. And that is what is happening now, if you look at the figures that I just mentioned. In these states, particularly New South Wales and Queensland, the cost of production is higher, and dairy farmers will not remain in the dairy industry if they are only paid the international price when it is low. That is why there has been an emergence of a great differential in prices for milk between those states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To simply say we should somehow have a floor price does not address that differential. How do we set a floor price which addresses that differential? And how do we justify to the farmers, say, in Victoria, that their floor price would, of necessity, be many cents lower than that in Queensland set by regulation, because the businesses relying on their milk in many circumstances could not survive on the higher price being paid north of the Queensland-New South Wales border? So I am concerned at the trend which has emerged in that dissenting report because the trend indicates to me perhaps an appeal to popularity rather than a regard to the historical circumstances of the industry and its future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry has gone through hard times. It has gone through a period where prices were high, but also in drought. It then went through the global financial crisis when prices fell sharply because of a fall in international prices. And now it is going through a period of uncertainty where supermarkets are seeking to capture more of the value using the price of drinking milk as a major marketing tool, with the Coles 'Down, down' and so-called 'Staying down' campaign, where milk is being valued at around $1 a litreâ€”some say, much less than the price of water in a bottle. So, in other words, the water, having gone through the cow, has been devalued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I suggest that it would be appropriate for the committee, when they consider this matter furtherâ€”and I am sure that they willâ€”to have regard to all of those circumstances. It would be appropriate for the committee to look at the circumstances in which dairy farmers find themselves bargaining with processors about the price of the milk that they sell every day. That is one thing that dairy farmers have to do: they have to sell their milk every day. They cannot store it and sell it when the price is high; they have to sell it fresh every day. They are dependent on what happens in their bargaining with the processors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would also be appropriate for the committee to have a close look at the power of the supermarkets. We have a very powerful supermarket sector in this country. They are able to drive prices down in this and a number of other areas. But we do have to have regard to the consequences for primary producers, and manufacturers and processors of product, that ultimately have to sell their food products to consumersâ€”and we do depend on that. But they should not be placed in circumstances where there is excessive power to the supermarkets in the equation, perhaps delivering lower prices to consumers but making some businesses, farm and manufacturing nonviable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e6c" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WORTLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  Chairing the parliament's Joint Select Committee on Cyber Safety, I have heard from many about their concerns regarding privacy and related issues. One that causes great concern is that of identity theft. It is an achievement of this government that this issue is being addressed in part through the passage of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Identity Crimes and Other Measures) Act 2010. The bill for the act passed quietly, but the reforms that resulted are significant and they touch each and every person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Identity theft is real, it is epidemic, and its manifestations range from the simple theft of a wallet or purse to elaborate online frauds, all with the aim of using the victim's personal details, without his or her knowledge, to fraudulently obtain goods, services, cash or credit. Many of us know someone whose stolen credit card has subsequently been used without his or her knowledge or authorisation. We know people who have received those emails known as 'phishing', where criminals, posing as legitimate organisations such as banks, use apparently corporate websites to solicit passwords, tax file numbers and the like. Indeed, many of us in this chamber have received those emails, too. Clearly, sufficient numbers of people respond to these emails to make the scams worth continuing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would appear that, even if we do not shop or bank or pay bills online, our personal details can still be available to increasingly sophisticated hackers. The majority of information now has some connection to the world wide web, and if we have ever, for example, registered a car, claimed a Centrelink benefitâ€”which, of course, is deposited to a bank accountâ€”obtained household insurance or made any other similar transactions, our personal details could eventually be uncovered by way of increasingly sophisticated computer techÂ­nology. Meanwhile, the plumber, our accountant and many other service providers will happily hand over their BSB and account details for direct deposit of payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are numerous examples of crimes and potential crimes, and most of those I have highlighted are personal crimes. But small businesses and even large corporations are subject to such fraudulent practices. The consequences of these crimes for persons, small businesses and large corporations can be significant. A victim of identity theft can be completely oblivious until he or she finds that their bank account has been emptied, that credit has been obtained in their name, or even that a crime has been committed, allegedly by the victim. Such consequences can take months, sometimes years, to repair. The victim's creditworthiness can be damaged. He or she may unknowingly have a criminal record that comes to light well after the alleged offence, but in time to jeopardise a job offer or a visa application. You can only imagine the shock of finding out any or all of these things, and the effort, time and expense involved in repairing the damage and restoring one's reputation. You can imagine the emotional strain that could ensue, possibly over a very extended period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My research shows that estimates of the financial cost of identity theft in Australia can reach up to $4 billion per year, and that crimes of this nature are growing faster than any other area of criminal endeavour. Of course, identity theft is a transnational crime. It is clear that the instances I have outlined are likely to represent only a tiny part of a more organised and highly sophisticated underlying criminal structure, both here in Australia and overseas. That is why we need to be increasingly vigilant in relation to our personal information and the ways in which we disclose it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The act to which I refer comprises a number of amendments to do with law enforcement, privacy and related matters. Chief among these is the creation in the Criminal Code of three offences to do with identity theft. They are: dealing in idenÂ­tification information where the perpetrator intends to pass him or herself off as another personâ€”living or dead, real or fictitiousâ€”to commit or assist in the commission of an indictable offence under Commonwealth law; the possession of identification information where the perpetrator intends to use the information to commit or assist in the dealing offence; and the possession of equipment to create identification docuÂ­mentation where the perpetrator or another person intends to use the equipment to create documentation so as to engage in conduct constituting the dealing offence. The act also provides for an extended geographical jurisdiction. As identity theft is a transÂ­national crime, so too the three offences will also be applicable to an Australian citizen or citizens, or an Australian body corporate outside this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions represent significant progress in the fight against identity crime, but increased vigilance, as I mentioned earlier, is the key to protecting ourselves against crimes of this nature. It may sound simple, but just on a personal level we can facilitate this by actually checking the transactions on our credit card statements and then disposing of these by shredding them and not just tossing them into the recycling bin. We can cut up expired drivers licences, credit cards and the like instead of disposing of them intact. We can take care when opening emails from an unfamiliar source, and particular care when our personal or financial details are requested by an unknownâ€”or even a knownâ€”person or organisation, whether in person, on the telephone or online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the 2008 <span style="font-style:italic;">OECD Policy Guidance On Online Identity Theft</span> points out with particular reference to the latter:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Online ID theft is a fraudulent activity which has become increasingly complex, relying on ever changing high-tech methods. Tackling it requires concerted, collaborative efforts by all stakeholders (<span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">i.e</span>. government, business, and consumers). Education and awareness are therefore necessary to ensure that both consumers and businesses are aware of the importance of the problem, and knowledgeable about its evolving forms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enhancing community and business awareness is key to combating this expanding and constantly evolving global problem, as well as criminal sanctions, such as those encapsulated in the act for those who engage in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With those remarks, I take this opportunity to commend our government for its foresight in legislating to combat these 21st century crimes through the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Identity Crimes and Other Measures) Act 2010.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator KROGER:</span>
                  </a>  I recently had the opportunity to be part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program that visited Afghanistan, in particular Oruzgan province in the first week of May. This was a unique experience that provided me with a comprehensive insight into the rationale of our operations, along with the scale of the logisticsâ€”an opportunity that I wish all Australians could share.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The visit presented the opportunity to understand the complexities of a country beset with the challenges of rival tribes, power struggles and ideological battles for the hearts and minds of its people in a country which is notable for its dramatic, harsh and unrelenting climate and landscape. My short time in Afghanistan, walking in the footsteps of our courageous professional and just soldiers has reaffirmed my pride in being an Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The visit not only gave me an opportunity to assess our involvement in the war on terror but it also brought me into direct contact with our troops of all ranks, and reaffirmed my perceptions and assumptions about the men and women of the Australian Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I make some general observations, I would like to acknowledge Lynton Dixon, Executive Officer of the ADFPP and Major Micah Batt from HQJOC, our escort, guide and mentor, who ensured that our daily schedule worked and kept us busy and safe. He was pivotal to our safekeeping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We flew to the ADF's theatre headquarters at Al Minhab, the location of the Joint Task Force 633, where we met with the commander of HQJTF633, Major General Angus Campbell. We were given a very thorough and candid overview by the Major General, along with Air Commodore John Oddie. This was an early indication of the open and transparent approach that was taken by all who we met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The logistical magnitude of the military presence in the Middle East starts at AMAB, where personnel and supplies are sent for demarcation into Afghanistan. The base is currently home to 550 men and women. It can support twice that number, and conditions personnel in climate and hygiene challenges, and equips personnel for their next stage. We received a shortened drill in the diversity and evolving physical manifestations of improvised explosive devices, known as IEDs, the type of terrain and machinery where they had been found and the invidious damage they cause. A session of weapon training at the rifle range demonstrated, however, why we should focus on influence through the power of the word rather than our prowess with the rifle. In retrospect, I realise that this was a bit like a holiday camp before we were embedded with the troops in the multinational base at Tarin Kot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tarin Kot is a stark placeâ€”flying in over Pakistan into a landscape of jagged mountains chiselled out of a barren, hard baked earth. Along the meandering brown waters of the Helmand River, subsistence farmers have learnt the ways of past centuries, with irrigation channels effectively carved into the baked earth. The romantic illusion of flower beds dotted along the river banks was shattered with the realisation that the pink flowers were the seeds of the heroin trade. We had arrived at the beginning of Nesh, the harvest season of the opium poppies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Afghanistan accounts for 90 per cent to 92 per cent of the world's production of heroinâ€”currently a necessary financial imperative for these subsistence farmers. The drug lords demand that the farmers grow the opium poppy as part of their crop, taking 10 per cent of the profits. The sale of opium allows them to invest in seed for wheat or other crops and pays for the fertiliser, so necessary in this desolate part of the world. This continues to be a challenge for the provincial government . The sale of opium delivers a $100 million annual boost to the Afghan economy. To destroy opium crops is to destroy the economic viability of the province. The province needs to be weaned off this dependence with significant supportâ€”and, in so doing, breaking the nexus with the drug lords. Some of this manufactured product, as we know, ends up on our streets in Melbourne and Sydney and beyond. It is a socially destructive trade that destroys lives, and its genesis is here in the meandering delta of what is known as the green zone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tarin Kot we were embedded with the troops, where we shared their shipping container accommodation, their mess huts and, more importantly, their views on why they were there, what they were doing and achieving, and the difference they were making on the ground to the lives of the Afghans. There is no Australian equivalent that can be used to describe this backward province. In the words of the Australian Deputy Commander, Colonel Dennis Malone, it is the Tennant Creek of Afghanistanâ€”and I do not in any way wish to impugn the residents of Tennant Creek. Those who live in the area do so largely because it is their traditional home. Running water and sanitation do not exist and hygiene is a challenge, with malaria ever present. The locals live in qualasâ€”a construction comprising of a baked mud wall that encloses a small room where they sleep with perhaps another room used for an animal or agricultural storage. It is subsistence living at its most basic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without the work of our troops, roads would be nothing but hardened dirt tracks and they would remain beholden to the demands of the drug lords. The safety of the people was at the whim of the Taliban, many of them warring tribal clans who received the support and encouragement of al-Qaeda to fund their war against Western civilisation through the sale of the opium poppy. It was places like Oruzgan Province that provided safe havens for the insurgents, home to the al-Qaeda training campsâ€”camps that were nothing more than bases for teaching the killing skills of Islamic fundamentalist terrorists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The multinational base here has made extraordinary progress in securing so much of the area, restoring stability and enabling the Afghan people to return to a more normal life. We were provided open access to the members of the Combined Team Uruzgan under the command of US Colonel Jim Creighton, who gave us a high-level account of the strategy in securing the province and the impressive military intelligence and hardware tools that they employ. The camp is home to 3,000 troops and most of the Australian deployment. Whilst the senior commanding officers provided us with a great insight, it was the informal discussions with so many of our soldiers that I found so productive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always had a great respect for the men and women of the ADF and their choice to fight for our democratic freedom and the protection of Western civilisation values. My admiration and respect grew exponentially as I moved amongst them, listening to them and observing them. Their professionalism, integrity and courage were carried like a mantle around their shoulders. Never before have I been so proud of my fellow Australians. The leadership skills that they have learnt through their education and training in the ADF were on full display and I was truly humbled to spend time with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My experiences demanded that I reflect on the numerous inquiries launched by the Defence minister in response to alleged offences that happened recently in ADFA. Whilst I do not condone stupid, puerile, sexist or immature behaviour of a few undergraduates, it would be a terrible injustice to judge and ascribe unprofessional behaviour to the rest of the ADF. The men and women I saw demonstrated that the recent concerns raised in Australia do not apply to them. The comradeship and mutual respect shown to each other underly the gender equality, integrity and professionalism that they apply to their daily lives. Given the harsh environment of the base, its size, the close proximity of the environment that they share and the military challenges they face, they conduct themselves in an exemplary manner. The Hercules pilot tasked with flying us into Tarin Kot was Liesl, a wonderful example of a capable woman in a demanding job. It was a very symbolic way in which to arrive in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The advances that have been made and are sustained in the province were implicit in the activities that we participated in. One of the highlights of the trip was a visit to a number of the reconstruction projects that are managed and funded through the financial support of AusAID. These reconstruction projects are critical as they build on the local capacity for independent endeavours and underpin the strategic approach of the coalition forces in removing the insurgents and practically enabling the locals to resume lives free of fear, intimidation and reprisals. There are nine AusAID officers in the country, who oversee the rebuilding of basic amenities. With military escorts, we visited an impressive Australian-built mosque and a school currently being built for 500 girls. In the province, the literacy rate for women is only three per centâ€”for men it is not much better; it is only eight per centâ€”so the construction of a girls' school is significant progress that is supported by the locals. We also travelled to a trades centre school, where men and boys, some as young as 12 or 13, are taught the critical skills of building, plumbing and paintingâ€”all skills that provide a meaningful way in which they can earn a living.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australians have also assumed responsibility for the training and mentoring of the Afghan National Army and the Afghan Police. This undertaking is without question the most compelling contribution that can be made in helping them develop the capacity to sustain relative stability when coalition forces are withdrawn. The Afghanis are recruited from within and outside the province, which also assists in breaking down the allegiance to local tribes. The locals are proud of what they are achieving with our support, with close to 100,000 people recruited to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most impressive visit, however, was to Patrol Base Wali, where we were briefed by Intelligence Officers Captain Jim Wallace and Captain Chris Stuart. This visit was made on a Black Hawk flight located some 30 minutes from the main base, an area that has been secured in only the last six months. The courage, leadership, strength and resilience that these men showed was awe inspiring and I salute them. We also had a flight to Kandahar, meeting with senior Australian embedded staff, including the Deputy Commander, Brigadier Bruce Scott, and a tour of the Heron Intelligence Coordination Centre and control centre, amongst many other site visits. These visits only reinforced my view that our contribution to this war against terror is a necessary and important one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The successful covert operation by US forces to remove the head and symbolic face of the Taliban, Osama bin Laden, the terrorist responsible for the death of thousands of men, women and children, should only serve to reinforce our resolve to stay the course and ensure the stability of Afghanistan. We must be resolute in ensuring that the country does not return to its former status as a safe haven for terrorists, whose mission in life is to destroy the democratic principles of Western civilisation and the values that we uphold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to acknowledge my appreciation to the ADF for their support of the program and to the many people who gave their time and provided the logistical support to ensure our safe keeping. I salute our men and women in Afghanistan who are fighting on our behalf. They have my unqualified support and admiration.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberQuestion">Senator Siewert</span>
                  </a>  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 2010:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to clarify the employment and working conditions for Aboriginal workers employed under the Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program (SIHIP), including under what conditions participants in Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) program, traineeships or work-for-the-dole programs may be employed. I have received some disturbing reports from communities in central Australia of the inconsistent treatment of Aboriginal workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The main allegations I have heard are:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Aboriginal workers on CDEP or on income management being promised top-up pay that they do not receive or fully receive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Inconsistent and diminishing rates of top-up pay for workers, so that workers continuously employed to do the same work for the same number of hours a day receive less pay in subsequent pay packets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">A failure to provide pay slips, employment contracts or other documentation to Aboriginal workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">A failure to report on employment outcomes to Job Services Australia (JSA) providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Minimal training (e.g. 1 day) for extended periods of work (e.g. 3 to 4 months).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Aboriginal contractors being asked to include CDEP places to reduce costs, and receiving less work when they refuse to do so.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Different workers doing the same work side-by-side, but receiving vastly different pay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Over subscription of CDEP workers for the amount of work required (e.g. 15 or 20 put on to do the work of 5 to 6 full-time workers) with the expectation that a number will drop out (and are effectively forced to do so).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am concerned that, if some or all of these allegations are true, they are undermining the positive employment outcomes that could be achieved by the significant opportunity provided by SIHIP, therefore:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Can a breakdown be provided, by community, of the number of Indigenous SIHIP workers: (a) on grandfathered CDEP payments; (b) in receipt of CDEP via Basics Card; (c) on other work experience programs; (d) being paid real wages; and (e) who received top-up wages, including the amount received.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(7) If there are accredited Aboriginal contractors willing and able to do construction or maintenance work, can and should they be excluded in favour of CDEP workers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(9) Are companies providing training or managing CDEP or work-for-the-dole programs required to clearly inform workers up-front as to how many hours they can work and how much top-up money they will be paid.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">(13) (a) What are the contractual obligations of Community Enterprises Australia (CEA) and New Future Alliance under SIHIP; and (b) are they required to report on employment outcomes, number of hours worked, rates of pay etc.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(15) Which other communities who are in receipt of SIHIP housing or renovations also have, or will have, CDEP and work experience participants working on them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(16) What action, if any, is the Government taking to remedy: (a) the underpayment of CDEP workers; (b) the lack of placement or outcome fees for referring JSA providers due to inadequate outcomes reporting by CEA; or (c) the loss of potential wages to Aboriginal contractors paying Aboriginal workers real wages for doing real work, who were overlooked in favour of the cheaper CDEP or work experience option. </span>

                  </a>  The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) From 14 September 2010 to 28 February 2011 the total amount expended on publications was $1,258.56. Expenditure on stationery is recorded by the Department under a single account code and it would be too resource intensive to identify what proportion was attributed to the Office of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The Minister's Office does not use printed letterhead and instead prints the letter template straight onto blank paper. As expenditure for blank paper supplied by the Department is recorded under a single account code, it would be too resource intensive to identify what proportion was attributed to the Minister's Office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Until mid-January 2011 the Minister's Office used 50% recycled copy paper that is 80 GSM for correspondence from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. From mid-January to date the Office has used a paper that is 110 GSM. This was used to exhaust stocks that the Department of Defence had provided to the Office. The Office will shortly transition to a new paper that is 104 GSM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The 80 GSM and the 110 GSM papers used for ministerial responses were not carbon neutral. The 104 GSM paper that the Office will transition to shortly is carbon neutral.</span>

That information indicated that the project was assessed and funded by the commercial arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and that the IFC financing of the project was subject to the mine operator meeting stringent environment and social standards. The IFC also has ongoing monitoring and reporting in place, including assessments by independent consultants. Since the financing was approved by the IFC, the project has publicly reported on its management of environmental and social issues. EFIC's review provided adequate assurance that World Bank Group policies and guidelines had been met at the time of that review. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) EFIC commenced the current review of its Environment Policy more than 18 months ago. Over that time EFIC has consulted its stakeholders through a variety of methods including one-on-one discussions, distribution of a questionnaire to clients, a formal public consultation period (discussed under questions 2 and 3) and a workshop with respondents to the formal consultation (discussed under question 6).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) (3) and (4) EFIC formally consulted its stakeholders by posting a draft revised Environmental Policy and Procedure on its website and requesting submissions from interested parties. The consultation period was open between 6 August and 1 October, 2010 and was twice extended following the separate requests of two civil society organisations that eventually made submissions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To encourage submissions EFIC directly emailed details of the consultation period and the consultation documents to those people and organisations registered with EFIC to receive alerts when EFIC's Category A register is updated. (The Category A register advises stakeholders of EFIC's potential involvement in projects with a potential for significant environmental and social impact). </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (a) EFIC received three submissions from civil society organisations (CSOs): Oxfam Australia, Jubilee Australia and the Mineral Policy Institute. (b), (c), (d) and (e) EFIC organised a workshop in December 2010 with the three CSOs that responded to its request for submissions on its Environment Policy Review (discussed under question 6). One of the outcomes of that workshop was an agreement that EFIC will publish on its website: </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">- provide an opportunity for EFIC and the CSOs to discuss the Policy, Procedure and the submissions, and</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(7) EFIC has internal expertise in environmental and social impact assessment and management. However EFIC did not engaged an independent corporate social responsibility expert. A combination of that expertise and consultation with stakeholders and the other activities noted above has provided a broad basis for the preparation of the new Policy and Procedure. </span>

Coincidental to EFIC's Environment Policy review there has been a review by the International Finance Corporation of the Performance Standards (EFIC's benchmark) and a review of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development "Common Approaches" (EFIC's international obligation). EFIC staff have been actively participating in these reviews.</span>

                  </a>  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 13 December 2010:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With reference to the current environment policy and reporting procedures of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), and drawing on examples of the export credit agencies operating in Canada, the United States of America (US) and Japan:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) In terms of establishing international benchmarks for the practice of export credit agencies and their environment policies, is it fair to compare EFIC to other export credit agencies such as Export Development Canada (EDC), Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC); if not, why not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Has EFIC adopted an environment policy that is consistent or comparative with the environment policies adopted by EDC, Ex-Im Bank and JBIC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Is EFIC complying with industry best practice; if so, can a copy of its guidelines, policies or standards outlining industry best practice be provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Given that the EDC's implementation and compliance with its Environmental Review Directive is reviewed every 5 years by the Auditor General of Canada: (a) has EFIC's implementation and compliance with its environment policy been independently reviewed and audited by the Australian Auditor-General or an independent third party in the past 5 years; and (b) is there anything in the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991 (the Act) that prevents the Australian Auditor-General performing this audit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) Can the Minister confirm that the export credit agencies Ex-Im Bank and JBIC disclose monthly summaries of the minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors, in addition to media releases published, in order to provide a level of public accountability and to keep domestic stakeholders up to date with transactions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(6) Does EFIC disclose summaries of its Board minutes to the Australian public; if not, is there anything in the Act that prevents EFIC from disclosing these summaries to the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(7) Given that the Canadian export credit agency, EDC, has at least one corporate social responsibility (CSR) representative on the Board of Directors, does EFIC have a CSR representative/expert on their Board; if not, is there anything in the Act that prevents the appointment of a CSR representative/expert to the EFIC Board.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(8) With reference to the JBIC and Ex-Im Bank process, where, after receiving submissions on Category A projects, a summary of their benchmarking against International Finance Corporation Performance Standards is published to demonstrate compliance and transparency to domestic stakeholders: (a) how many Category A projects did EFIC disclose in the 2009-10 financial year; (b) does EFIC respond to public submissions on Category A projects beyond a letter of acknowledgement; if not, is there anything in the Act that prevents EFIC from responding to the substance contained in public submissions; and (c) does EFIC publish summaries of project benchmarking; if not, is there anything in the Act that prevents EFIC from disclosing summaries of project benchmarking.</span>

                  <a href="3L6" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Conroy:</span>
                  </a>  The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) export credit agencies (ECAs) have agreed that they will use a common approach for addressing environmental issues relating to officially supported export credits. The agreement is referred to as the OECD Common Approaches. As a result, all OECD ECAs (including EFIC, EDC, Ex-Im Bank and JBIC) apply the same standard for transactions involving officially supported export credits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, a number of ECAs provide products and services beyond officially supported export credits that are appropriate to their Government mandate. As an example, US Ex-Im's mandate is largely focussed on the provision of export credits, whilst, in addition to export credits, JBIC provides a broader range of products in fulfilling a development and strategic acquisition role for Japan. EDC in Canada has a very broad mandate and operates more closely to a commercial bank. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Accordingly, the environmental policies of ECAs may need to cover both export credits and other types of business. The variations in mandate and differences in environment policies make direct comparisons somewhat difficult. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) As indicated in the response to question 1 it is difficult to directly compare EFIC's Environment Policy with the environmental policies of other ECAs. Some points of difference may further illustrate this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">EFIC has adopted the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards as its benchmark for conducting environmental and social reviews of transactions (since the IFC Performance Standards were introduced in 2006 no other benchmark has been used by EFIC for transactions). The other three ECAs referenced in the question nominate and use either the World Bank Safeguard Policies or the IFC Performance Standards depending on the transaction type.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">EFIC's Environment Policy applies to all transactions. EFIC understands that this is not the case for EDC and the Ex-Im Bank while JBIC's position is unclear in this respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">EFIC considers that the standards and procedures nominated in its Environment Policy benchmark well in comparison to that of any other OECD ECA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) The IFC Performance Standards are widely regarded as the best practice benchmark for environmental and social assessment. The Performance Standards and associated Guidelines are applicable to almost any type of activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A copy of the Performance Standards and Guidelines can be found at: </span>
              </p>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">EFIC occasionally supplements the IFC Performance Standards with other guidelines or standards and this is determined according to the needs of specific transactions. For example, EFIC has referenced the community development toolkit of the International Council on Metals and Mining (ICMM) and has also used the Human Rights Guidance Tool for the Financial Sector developed by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) (a)There is no legislative requirement that the Australian Auditor-General audit EFIC's Environment Policy. The last external review of EFIC's implementation of its Environment Policy was commissioned by EFIC from PriceWaterhouseCoopers in 2004. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its current Environment Policy review, EFIC is considering a regular independent audit of the application of its Environment Policy. The audit frequency has yet to be determined. EFIC's preference would be to engage a specialised environmental consultancy to undertake the proposed audit so that people with the requisite experience and skills are involved, which would enhance the effectiveness of the audit.(b)There is nothing in the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991 (the EFIC Act) that prevents the Australian Auditor-General performing this audit. The appointment of the Australian Auditor-General to perform such an audit would be regulated by the Auditor-General Act 1997 (Cth).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) The US Ex-Im Bank publishes a brief summary of its Board meetings. The information provided is limited to the names of the parties involved in a transaction, the transaction type, the amount and term of the financial support provided for the transaction, the country where the transaction is located and the Board's decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

(b) EFIC provides a letter of acknowledgement to those that make a written submission on Category A projects. EFIC incorporates these submissions into its due diligence process prior to making a decision to provide or decline support for a transaction.  Section 87 of the EFIC Act contains provisions which prohibit the disclosure by EFIC employees, officers and Board members of information relating to EFIC's business under the EFIC Act. (c) EFIC does not publish summaries of project benchmarking. EFIC is aware of only one ECA that regularly publishes a summary of project benchmarking; JBIC, which publishes a very brief overview of each of its 'Category A' projects. The published summary contains little information on a project's environmental and social impacts and resultant management response. JBIC is also not a directly comparable organisation to EFIC as it also fulfils a development and strategic acquisition role for Japan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) (a) and (b) The method of determining the size and composition of the annual Migration Program has not changed over the last five years. However, since 2010 the Department analysed temporary migration trends alongside permanent migration program trends. This information has been considered alongside the migration program to ensure that immigration levels are optimal in terms of their economic contribution, and balanced against adjustment costs which flow from resultant population growth. </span>

Input from these consultations is considered as part of future Migration Program planning. Regular internal and external evaluations and reviews of migration programs and policies are also undertaken to ensure these are meeting their objectives. For example the Independent category of the Skill Stream was reviewed in 2010, and the Business Skills and Employer Sponsored Category is currently under review, as is the Student Visa program which is a key feeder category for the permanent program.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) that the DPP and the AFP had therefore decided not to prosecute Mr Zentai for the alleged war crime, although if there had been sufficient evidence to support a charge, (which there was not) it would have been open to the Australian authorities to charge Mr Zentai and have him tried in Australia, rather than extradite him; </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(c) that the Republic of Hungary only wanted Mr Zentai to be extradited to Hungary for interrogation, as no charge has been laid against him.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Has the Minister ever suggested to the Hungarian authorities that they conduct their 'investigation' and/or 'interrogation' of Mr Zentai in Australia; if so, what was the Republic of Hungary's response; if not, why has the Minister not made that suggestion to the Republic of Hungary, having regard to the age and health of Mr Zentai, the fact that the Hungarian authorities have said they only want him for interrogation and the fact that Mr Zentai has stated that he is prepared to cooperate with investigators and is prepared to answer questions on oath.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) As set out in the judgment of His Honour Justice McKerracher in Zentai v Honourable Brendan O'Connor (No 3) [2010] FCA 691, prior to making a surrender determination in respect of Mr Zentai, the Minister was provided with a submission (annexing relevant documentation) prepared by the Attorney-General's Department. The submission discussed advice provided by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the Australian Federal Police on evidentiary issues relating to the allegations against Mr Zentai and also discussed the basis on which the Republic of Hungary sought Mr Zentai's extradition. As the issues raised by Senator Boyce are the subject of proceedings currently before the Full Court of the Federal Court, it is not appropriate to comment further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The submission prepared by the Attorney-General's Department referred to in response to Question (1) above was before the Minister at the time he determined that Mr Zentai was to be surrendered to Hungary to face prosecution for a war crime. In view of the issues raised in current litigation in this matter, it is not appropriate to comment further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) The decision of Mr Justice McKerracher of 2 July 2010 raises significant and complex issues for the administration of Australia's extradition scheme. It is appropriate that an appeal be pursued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The Republic of Hungary made a formal request under the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the Republic of Hungary for the extradition of Mr Zentai to face prosecution for a war crime. Australia has an obligation to consider that request in accordance with the Treaty and the Extradition Act 1988. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (a) The approximate cost to the Commonwealth of  litigation in the matter of Mr Zentai's extradition to date is $455,000 (including GST and disbursements). These include costs of approximately $247, 000 incurred in earlier proceedings instituted by Mr Zentai challenging various aspects of the extradition process, including the constitutionality of the Extradition Act 1988. Mr Zentai was unsuccessful in those proceedings. The Australian Central Authority for extradition in the Attorney-General's Department does not maintain records of the time particular officers spend on particular matters. (b) It would be inappropriate to provide an estimate of the costs of  the current appeal proceedings in circumstances where the proceedings are ongoing and at a relatively early stage.</span>
