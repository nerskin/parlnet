                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again we see the Australian Labor Party trying to get in the way of the orderly dispatch by this Senate of its business. What the government seeks to do today is to ensure that the childcare package, which will be of benefit to a million Australian families, is able to be debated and disposed of. The most sensible thing for the Labor Party to do would have been to cooperate with the government, but of course the one thing that we know the Labor Party is determined to do is to obstruct at every turn every attempt that the Turnbull government makes to try and get the budget in order while, at the same time, providing for social benefits in a way that is targeted to the most needy Australian families—which is precisely what the childcare package does.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to my colleague and friend Senator Simon Birmingham. When he inherited the portfolio which he now has, he inherited the mess, the wreckage that had been left over from the Rudd and Gillard governments' arrangements for child care. After long negotiations with the sector and after the extremely careful development of a package, he has arrived at a package which focuses the government provided benefits in the childcare system upon the families who need it most. But, of course, as those of us on our side of the parliament know, you cannot have these beneficial social programs without them being paid for, so they are going to be paid for, and we have found elsewhere the savings to enable us to pay for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill secures savings of over $2.4 billion over the forward estimates. The childcare package contains three measures: maintaining income-free areas and means-test thresholds for certain payments and allowances at their current levels for three years; automating the income stream review process, which will lead to improvements in the accuracy of income support payments and reductions in consumer debt; and extending and simplifying ordinary waiting periods for the parenting payment and the youth allowance for a person who is not undertaking full-time study and is not a new apprentice. These are all provisions of the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill.</span>

That is what this package of legislation does. That is what the childcare package does, so that families who need the support will get the support, and, meanwhile, we have found savings elsewhere in the budget to enable that to be paid for.

                  </a>  Senator O'Neill, please, you keep interjecting. I know I have touched a raw nerve with you, because you claim to believe in social justice—your leader does not, of course—and yet at every turn you try and get in the way of measures to focus the government's welfare measures on those at the bottom end of the income spectrum. That is what Senator Simon Birmingham, the minister, has been able to achieve with this legislation, but of course the Labor Party will vote against it. The Labor Party will vote against this legislation just as the Labor Party will vote against every measure that this government introduces in order to deal with the task of budget repair—a task that we inherited 3½ years ago when we inherited from them the most catastrophic set of financial accounts that any incoming government had inherited in Australian history. For 3½ years you have been standing in the way of budget repair, for 3½ years you have been standing in the way of social justice and you are going to try and do it again today.</span>

Let us be clear what he is doing. He is bringing in a motion that requires debate on legislation that we have not seen. That is what this hours motion does. He comes into the Senate and up-ends  standing orders, up-ends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Order o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f Business</span> and says to the Labor Party, 'We want you to agree to debate a bill that you have not even seen.' That is not orderly dispatch of the business of the Senate. That is a secret deal to take money off Australian families, and the government is not even prepared to demonstrate it to the Senate. We still have not even seen the bill that the crossbenchers have agreed to bring on for debate. That is no way to run the Senate.</span>

                  </a>  So let us be clear: this is an hours motion to rush through a secret deal, to come in here to the Senate, up-end the <span style="font-style:italic;">Order of Business</span> and suspend standing orders because we have to rush through and immediately debate other cuts to social security and other cuts to what families get, which we have not even seen. It is an extraordinary proposition, and it is a deal that has been done in secret. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say to the crossbench, as I have said previously to Senator Hanson and to others in this place: I may disagree with what your policy position is, but you are entitled to negotiate with the government on policy. But I fundamentally disagree with the way you are walking over the way this Senate should operate. To come in here and say, 'We want to have a bill debated now that you have not seen—because you have not been in the negotiations; you have not had it disclosed—sit till midnight tonight, sit till midnight tomorrow night and sit on Friday, with no other notice to senators' is an extraordinary way to run this chamber. This government is a government that is lurching from crisis to crisis and it is now again turning its sights to families. It is the old tried and true. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember that this is a government first elected on a promise that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education. Well, here is a government that is cutting assistance to families in a new, secret way that we do not even know about. We have record low wages, we have penalty rates being smashed and now we have cuts to payments that low-income families rely on, to fund a childcare package that will make life harder for many Australians. And they want to smash it through the Senate in a deal with the crossbench in the next three days, requiring us to sit additional hours at short notice on a bill we have not seen. When are you going to tell the Australian people what your deal is? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this government wants to cut the take-home pay of Australian workers to fund a $50 billion tax cut for big business. That is what this government's values are. We anticipate, whilst we have not seen the bill, that those values will continue to be reflected in this legislation. I say again to the crossbench: you are entitled to deal with the government on policy, but what an extraordinary way to make this Senate operate—to come in here and support an hours motion that you have got the numbers on. The Nick Xenophon Team have obviously signed up to this. Where are you? You believe in the proper process of the chamber and in democracy. You have got the numbers. You have given them the numbers on up-ending this place in order to get your deal through in the next two and a bit days to suit their agenda. Which cuts to families have you agreed to? Let us remember the childcare package leaves a third of families worse off. You cannot trust this government when it comes to take-home pay for workers, you cannot trust this government on health and education, and you cannot trust this government when it comes to family payments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  Following on from the contribution of Senator Wong, I think it is really important that people who are not familiar with the somewhat arcane processes employed here in the Senate understand what is actually happening. What is happening here is that we have two pieces of legislation which in fact we have not seen; we are not aware of what is in the legislation. We have not had the opportunity to examine and interrogate that legislation. It is now being rushed through the Senate. The hours motion says that it will be debated through until midnight tonight, midnight tomorrow night and then in an open-ended debate on Friday. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those people who may be listening and wondering what is unusual about that, the whole point of this chamber is for us to be given the opportunity to interrogate the details of specific legislation through a committee process. For those people who are not familiar with that, we have legislation presented through a committee process, we take evidence, we take submissions and we look for unintended consequences. We look to amend the legislation through that process so that what is ultimately passed through the Senate, even if it is not supported, at least has the scrutiny that it needs to avoid unintended consequences through its passage. None of that is going to happen right now. We have got legislation which will be railroaded through this parliament, in a deal struck behind closed doors, which no-one has had the opportunity to see, let alone examine, interrogate and give it the due scrutiny it deserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, people might say, 'Well, how is that possible—the house of review, the Senate, not being given the opportunity to look at legislation in the way that this House was designed to do?' It happens when the government gets together with members of the crossbench—with One Nation, with the Nick Xenophon Team and other crossbenchers—and says, 'Let's stitch this thing up. Let's get it through this week so that we can avoid the attacks and criticism that will come as a result of this legislation getting the due scrutiny it needs.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that one of those pieces of legislation involves significant cuts to the most vulnerable Australians. We know that, because that is what the government's savings measure entails. We know that what we are talking about here are cuts to family tax payments and cuts to households that are some of the poorest, most vulnerable households in the country. We are talking about cuts to people at the moment who cannot afford to pay their rent, who cannot afford to put food on the table, and yet we have got this government, with One Nation and with the Nick Xenophon Team, getting together to strike a deal to say, 'Let's ram this thing through before we get too much heat on us, because we know that these are unpopular, unfair cuts and we need to get them through this parliament as quickly as we can.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the crossbench, and I say, firstly, to One Nation, the party that says to the Australian community: 'We're the party that represents battlers. We look after the vulnerable, the marginalised. We look after the people who are not being looked after by the major parties.' Yet, what we see is One Nation joining with the Liberal Party more than almost any other member of parliament in the Senate. One Nation has fast become the far-right faction of the Liberal Party. It does not look after battlers; it looks after its mates at the big end of town. That is what One Nation is doing right now—showing the Australian community its true colours: 'We don't look after battlers; what we are doing are secret deals with the coalition to screw battlers, to do them over.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course how many lectures have we had from Nick Xenophon and his colleagues about due process? How many lectures have we had from the Xenophon team saying to us, <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>We haven't been given time. There's no Senate committee process'? Yet Senator Xenophon is joining with the coalition to ram this legislation through the parliament. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HDA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  The first thing I would say is that any suggestion that these measures come as a surprise and out of nowhere is completely false. In fact, the Labor Party has got to think about their narrative. In the lead-up to the last election, they called these measures zombies that had been around for so long that they were barely alive. Of course the government has always said that we were committed to securing the passage of the savings measures that have been reflected in the budget, and indeed we are continuing to make progress. We passed about $6.3 billion worth of savings in the first omnibus savings bill through the Senate in September last year with the general support of the Labor Party. Today we are seeking to secure the next instalment of remaining unlegislated savings from previous budgets through the Senate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am pleased to share with the chamber is that three of the schedules that will be in this bill are in fact directly out of the social services omnibus savings bill, which has been in front of the Senate for some time and has been well and truly ventilated. It includes maintaining the income-free areas and means test thresholds for certain payments and allowances at their current levels for three years. It includes automating the income stream review process, which will lead to improvements in the accuracy of income support payments and reductions in customer debts. It also includes the extending and simplifying of ordinary waiting periods for the parenting payment and for youth allowance for a person who is not undertaking full-time study and is not a new apprentice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, what we are proposing to do is pause the indexation of family tax benefit payments for two years from 1 July 2017—again, this is not a new concept and this is not something that is very difficult to understand. What it means is that no family that receives payments today will lose payments. Every single family that receives payments today will at least receive the same payments moving forward. There will not be indexation for two years. Though, because of the continuing indexation in particular in relation to lower-income thresholds and the like, it is likely that many families will still continue to see some increases in payments, but there will not be any indexation in the base rate and maximum payment rates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time they are saying, <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>Oh, you want to ram this through'—which of course we will not; it will be an open-ended debate—and 'We haven't seen any of this before,' which of course everybody has. This has been well ventilated since the 2014-15 budget. In fact Senator Whish-Wilson was quoting proverbs in question time the other day, talking about dogs returning to their vomit. He said: 'These measures have been around for so long—why are you persisting with them?' But the government is persisting with them. The government is continuing to seek to legislate, and it is true that we have worked with crossbench senators because Labor and the Greens in relation to these measures were not prepared to pursue further budget repair, even though it was necessary, given the mess Labor left behind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is the next instalment. Building on the progress that we made in the initial omnibus savings bill, we will be able to secure more savings today. There will be more work to do after today, but this is as far as we believe the Senate will be prepared to go on this occasion, and that is what we are putting forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Di Natale, at the same time as saying he does not know what we are doing, then proceeds to criticise all of the things that supposedly he does not know we are doing: 'I don't know what you are doing, but this is what it is and I'm against it.' The truth is: we could be arguing in this Senate about these measures for as long as it takes to walk from Canberra to Perth and back, and the Labor Party and the Greens would still be opposed to them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people want us to make progress. The Australian people want the Senate to make progress on budget repair. The Australian people want the Senate to deal with the government's important childcare reforms to make access to child care more affordable and more flexible for families. We are very grateful to the support from crossbenchers like Senator Hinch, Senator Xenophon and his team, and the One Nation team, for having worked constructively with the government to help facilitate further budget repair and also help facilitate the successful passage of very important childcare reforms. We certainly commend to the Senate that this motion, which was moved by our leader, Senator Brandis, should be supported, so that we can proceed with giving effect to the government's budget measures contained in the legislation on childcare reforms.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:52</span>):  What an extraordinary contribution from Senator Cormann. We had Senator Cormann actually reading out and trying to explain what is in legislation that has not even been presented to this chamber. He was on his feet during a suspension of standing orders trying to inform senators what detail is in the bill because none of us have seen it. That is the ridiculous position that the Senate is placed in this morning. The other comment from Senator Cormann I would pick up on was when he congratulated himself on the cuts to families that are coming, which we have been fighting to several years now, and then warning that there is more to come—warning those families that there is more to come. Watch out; we are coming after you!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen these attacks on the most vulnerable families in Australia before. This is something that has been attempted for the last few years by this government, and we have stood and prevented these changes every step of the way. Now we are seeing this dirty little arrangement—yet another one—where every time this government fails it is straight off to the crossbench to try and stitch up some deal to deliver its agenda: an agenda that hits the poorest, the most vulnerable citizens in this community. The crossbench are the enablers in this. The crossbench are the enablers of this agenda, and we will not let them forget it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will stand up and fight against these changes. We will stand up for those families that rely on income support. We will stand up for unemployed people who rely on the community to help them support themselves in finding new jobs. We will look after the young people. We will support new families to spend valuable time with their new babies to allow them to get the best start in life. That is what guides us. They are our values. That is our commitment. We see this government and, in this situation, this crossbench enabling an agenda that attacks every one of those members of our community. We will not allow that to happen, and that is why we will oppose this suspension of standing orders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We find ourselves standing up here, arguing in the interests of these vulnerable members of our community, while this government supports cuts to penalty rates, while it is pushing forward with its $50 billion cuts to company tax, including $7 billion to the biggest banks in this country. We are meant to cop that kind of economic policy, while, at the same time, we are being asked to have this kind of debate today, without us having seen the legislation, without being given the courtesy, as the house of review, as the chamber that is required and that was formed to be a check on executive power, to scrutinise, to interrogate, to question in depth the policy decisions that lead to legislation that comes to this chamber—all of that is being thrown away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate will not be allowed to perform its role. It will not be able to do that today because the legislation that we have not even seen will not be able to be reviewed in depth. It will not be able to be examined. Public servants will not be able to be questioned about the underpinnings, the reasons behind those decisions. We will simply sit here and be forced to suffer and accept the deal that has been done by this crossbench, enabling this government's regressive agenda. We will not let the crossbench forget this this abuse of the Senate's role and, more importantly, the abuse of families, low-income Australians that rely on us to stand up for them and ensure that they get a good deal and to ensure that the they are supported. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing families that will lose $750 a year. I often wonder whether anyone on that side of politics, or even on the crossbench, actually knows what it is like to need this kind of support to get on your feet. I doubt it very much, because, if you did know—if you did have to live week by week, hand to mouth and you were told you had to cop a $750 cut this year—I do not think you would be sitting here smirking about the ramming through of this legislation today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will not only be these cuts; it will be the cuts to penalty rates. We will then have to cop the company tax cuts to allow big business to pay less tax, at a time we are telling low-income Australians, 'You've got to tighten your belts and suck it up.' Well, Labor is not going to agree to that, and we will not support this suspension today.</span>

                  <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  The suspension of standing orders that Senator Brandis has moved is to enable a substantive motion that would see the orderly attention brought to bear on important legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must, at this point, touch on something that Senator Cormann raised—that is, the concept of zombie measures. We know that those opposite have been saying that there are certain measures that never had a prospect of passage and, therefore, they were zombie measures. They know those so-called zombies well; they know them intimately. That is why it is more than a little surprising when colleagues on the opposite side of the chamber are saying: 'Oh, we have never met these measures before. These are actually newborns. These are newborn measures. No, no, we know we said they were zombies before, but they have transmogrified into newborns.' So, that is a little unusual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite say they do not know what the measures are in the legislation that is coming to us. They have no idea what the elements are of the measures that are coming to this place. But, despite the fact that they supposedly have no idea about them, they say they will oppose them. In fact, Senator Gallagher, the Manager of Opposition Business, said, 'We have prevented these changes every step of the way.' How do you prevent changes if you do not know what they are?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am having a little bit of difficulty finding the line through the arguments of those opposite, but, anyway, there we have it. I should also note that those opposite—in fact, I think the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, Senator Gallagher said that we have run off to the crossbench. We are meant to fold up our tent every time the Australian Labor Party say that they are opposed to a proposition. We are meant to say: 'Look, there is the possibility of getting it through the Senate. There is the possibility of talking to other colleagues.' But, no, we should not do that, because we do not want to hurt the feelings of those opposite! We see a bit of that: hurt feelings in this place. Whenever the government combines with another grouping in this place there is always another grouping that acts a little hurt and spurned, feeling, 'What is wrong with us?' On this occasion it is the Labor Party who are saying, 'What about me?'—to quote that great Australian song. Those opposite have counted themselves out. One of the reasons we talk to the crossbench is that first and foremost they have been duly elected by the Australian people. They are here as representatives, so it is appropriate that we deal with them. But the other reason we talk with the crossbench is that they are willing to talk, they are willing to engage and they are willing to be constructive. That is why we are very happy to talk with and to work with the Senate crossbench. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it was Senator Wong in her opening contribution who suggested that somehow what we are seeking to do is anything other than orderly. What we are wanting to do is enable an open-ended debate that will sit till midnight—Senate willing—until this is dealt with. If it is not dealt with by midnight then we will do the same on Thursday and we will come back on Friday. There is no guillotine here. There is no curtailment of debate. We are seeking to provide the opportunity to have a debate so that these measures, which are so well known by those opposite, can be aired and debated. Despite the fact that they are already well known, we want to provide as much opportunity as the Senate wants in order to address these issues. We think that is orderly, we think that is appropriate and we think that is a very good thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the Senate will agree to support the suspension of standing orders so that Senator Brandis can move his substantive motion so that Senator Cormann will then have the opportunity to introduce this important legislation. This Senate is working constructively, and we are very hopeful that today will be yet another example of how the Australian Senate is working and doing the peoples' business. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President, and I thank the Senate for their consideration. This is a chance for the crossbench to show who they really are, to show whether they stand up for low-paid workers, whether they stand up for working families or whether they are just going to jump into bed with the government, who has had low-paid Australians in its sights ever since it was elected. This is the chance for One Nation and Senator Xenophon and his team to show us whether they really are prepared to stand up for low-paid workers in this country or whether they are 'Liberal lite'. Let me tell you what we have seen from the Nick Xenophon Team and the One Nation team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Nick Xenophon Team, we certainly see what their values are by their preparedness to ditch process in this place for a set of secret deals around cuts to family payments, which we saw at 10.15. Let's understand that they signed up to a motion that went to debate at 10.15. So we know what Senator Xenophon's team thinks when it comes to democratic processes: they like them when it suits them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On One Nation, well, do you know what they are? They are Liberal patsies. That is what they are. They are just Liberal patsies; they really are. Every time George Brandis says, 'Jump', Senator Pauline Hanson says, 'How high?' Senator Hanson's team says, 'How high?' You have an opportunity now, Senator Hanson and your team. You have an opportunity now, Senator Kakoschke-Moore, Senator Griff and Senator Xenophon. Do you stand up for working people and their penalty rates or not? Do you—through you, Madam Deputy President—stand up for working people and their penalty rates?</span>

                  </a>  I accept that. Through you, Madam Deputy President—this is an opportunity for senators from the NXT, the Nick Xenophon Team, to show whether or not they really care about hospitality workers, retail workers, workers in this country who rely on penalty rates in their take-home pay or not. Are they going to prioritise a secret deal with the government to take money off working families over a bill that will protect the take-home pay of vulnerable workers in this country? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn now to the PHON, the Pauline Hanson One Nation team. The Senator Hanson and her team say they stand up for battlers. Well you have an opportunity now in the vote that will come up. You have an opportunity to stand up for battlers, because the bill that will be debated, should you support this motion, is the bill that Senator Cameron introduced this week which will protect penalty rates. Let me tell you, despite the fact that Senator Brandis does not understand what penalty rates mean to the take-home pay of workers, Australian workers do and Australian families do. They understand the impact of a decision that removes penalty rates, without any other equivalent compensation, for low-paid workers. They understand what it means to their take-home pay. We on this side—and, to their credit, the Greens—on this issue have been very clear about why this decision by the Fair Work Commission is wrong. </span>

                  </a>  And it is true—I will take the interjection from the lawyer. Yes, we did establish it, and it is only in the most extreme of circumstances that you would see the Labor Party walking away from a decision by the Fair Work Commission. But this is one of those decisions, because this is about vulnerable workers—many of them young people, many of them women—who rely on penalty rates for their take-home pay. I am always astonished by those on the other side who seem to forget—or maybe have never known—what it is like to actually struggle to pay the bills at the end of the week. I remember when I was an industrial officer and a lawyer acting for women and migrant workers who relied on penalty rates; let me tell you those workers depended on penalty rates to make ends meet. I will never forget that, but those opposite have never known that. You have never known that. You have never cared about low-paid workers, and your attitude today and the sneering laughing from the Leader of the Government in the Senate is a disgrace. He has never cared about low-paid workers, just as he has never cared— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill secures further savings of $2.4 billion over the 2017-18 forward estimates period building to a $6.8 billion dollar saving over the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new bill contains three measures from the original omnibus bill, including:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">1. Maintaining income free areas and means test threshold for certain payments and allowances at their current levels for three years;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">2. Automating the income stream review process which will lead to improvements in the accuracy of income support payments and reductions in customer debts; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">3. Extending and simplifying ordinary waiting periods for the parenting payment and for youth allowance for a person who is not undertaking full-time study and is not a new apprentice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes a new schedule to maintain the current family tax benefit payment rates for two years at their current levels from 1 July 2017. This measure will achieve savings of about $2 billion over the 2017-18 forward estimates which will build to $5.5 billion over the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that under this new measure there will be no cuts to family tax benefit payments. Indeed, over the two-year maintenance period many families will still see some increase in their payments as a result of increases to particular income thresholds for family tax benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also reversed a previous decision to increase FTB payment rates to offset in part the effect of the phase out of FTB supplements, which was contained in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill. Not proceeding with that increase in FTB payment rates will reduce costs by a further $2.3 billion over the current forward estimates period compared to the previous social services omnibus savings bill and will reduce costs over the medium term by about $11 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill further builds on the $6.3 billion in budget improvements achieved over the forward estimates through the first omnibus savings bill which passed the Senate on 15 September 2016—which included a saving of $1.6 billion over the forward estimates and $7.1 billion over the medium term from abolition of the family tax benefit supplements for households with income of more than $80,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the government's intention to secure the passage of both this bill and the child care bill through the Senate this week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the positive way in which the crossbench has worked with the government to deliver this significant reform package that will make a real and positive difference to nearly one million Australian families.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  Labor opposes this bill. This bill goes to indexation, to incomes stream review processes, to the ordinary wait periods and to family tax benefits. It is simply another example of this government being uncaring, this government having no understanding of what is important to ordinary families in this country and this government being completely out of touch with the battles that normal people have day in, day out to ensure that they can put food on the table and put clothes on their kids to send them off to school. This is a mean-spirited government. This is a government who does not care about the poor and disadvantaged in this country. This is a government who would give $50 billion in tax cuts to big businesses and at the same time support penalty rate cuts for 700,000 of the poorest workers in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Senator Brandis came in this morning, nobody had seen the bill. The bill had not been presented. There had been no discussions about the bill. A secret deal was done, and in they came to change the hours with no-one knowing what was in the bill. The first I saw of the bill was about 10 minutes ago, when I was handed the explanatory memorandum. This shows the lack of process and the contempt this government has not only for due process but also, more importantly, for families that are battling day in, day out to eke out a living in a time when living standards are declining, wages are being frozen and prices are going up. Yet this mob, they do not care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we had Senator Brandis saying this is an 'orderly dispatch of business'. Nobody puts this government and 'orderly' in the same sentence. They are anything but orderly. They have got no plan. They have got no strategy. They have got no economic credibility. Their only approach—and that is all it is, an ideological approach—is to attack the poorest in this country. Whether it is through the social security system, whether it is through the penalty rate system or whether it is through the industrial relations system: all they want to do is attack ordinary families in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most chilling aspect of the speeches we heard this morning was from Senator Cormann. Remember Senator Cormann after the 2014 budget that he was a key player in? Remember that budget that hammered pensioners, hammered welfare recipients? Remember that terrible budget that they have had to crab walk back day in, day out since it was introduced, the budget that gave us 'lifters and leaners'? If you were in a tough situation as an ordinary family and you required some welfare support, then you were a 'leaner'. But if you were former Treasurer Joe Hockey and you had to leave because you were so disgraced in terms of your budget, you end up—you are not a 'leaner', you are a 'lifter'. You get lifted off to Washington, to get about $400,000-plus a year in salary, plus a $150,000-plus pension. This guy had the cheek to call ordinary families 'leaners'. I know who was leaning: it was the economic team of the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann and Treasurer Hockey—remember the picture? Sitting there with their big Havana cigars, celebrating cutting key aspects of workers' security and social security? The big Havana cigars probably cost more than the $38 a day that someone on Newstart has to survive on. They were so happy, so proud, that they cracked out the Havana cigars to celebrate that 2014-15 budget. But what Senator Cormann said, the chilling part of what he said today is that there is 'more work to be done'. This is not the end of the attacks on poor people in this country. 'More work to be done'. I am not sure, as part of the secret deal with One Nation, Senator Xenophon, Senator Hinch and Senator Leyonhjelm, whether Senator Cormann told them what more work has to be done. What more cuts can we expect in the future? What more attacks on ordinary families are sitting behind this bill?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you: go back to the 2014-15 budget and look at the aspects of that and the attacks on pensioners. The changes to the indexation of pensioners would have left them $80 a week worse off over a 10-year period. That is why you crack out the Havana cigars: for attacking pensioners. They told young people with no capacity to find a job in areas where there is up to 20 per cent youth unemployment that they had to live with absolutely no income support for six months. What kind of mob is this sitting over there? This is what they really wanted to do. With Senator Cormann saying there is more work to be done, you can bet that all the nasties are waiting to come back in. They will cuddle up to One Nation, to Senator Xenophon, to Senator Hinch and they will work away to try to get the worst aspects of their attacks on working people implemented. Make no bones about: One Nation, Senator Xenophon, Senator Hinch and Senator Leyonhjelm are simply delivering for the Liberal and National parties. They are delivering all of the worst aspects of their budget approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And how dare Senator Xenophon try to stand up and be the pragmatic person of the people. Senator Xenophon has done more deals in here in this term of government than any other crossbencher. He makes the Democrats look like amateurs! This guy will always do the deal. He will always get this government out of trouble and put poor people in trouble. That is what Nick Xenophon is about. That is what his modus operandi is. I have never seen Senator Xenophon really act in the interests of working people. During the debates on industrial relations legislation, where did Senator Xenophon go? Straight to the Liberal Party, with a few amendments here and there to justify his capitulation on the protections for working people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about One Nation? Senator Hanson is out there telling everybody that she listens to the people, that she is there for the people. I have not seen her do one thing in this Senate that promotes decency or a decent social approach on any aspect of any bill that has come through this parliament. Senator Hanson is a reliable vote for the Liberals and the Nationals. She will deliver the cuts to welfare. She will deliver the attacks on penalty rates. She will deliver an uncaring attitude to the poor in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson is a fraud. Senator Xenophon is a fraud. If they were not frauds, they would be in here battling to support ordinary Australians against the attacks that this coalition government mounts on them day in day out. Whether it is welfare, industrial relations or penalty rates, the frauds of the Nick Xenophon Team and One Nation are over there cuddling up to the Liberal-National Party and delivering really bad outcomes for ordinary Australians in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the bill we have the freeze on indexation. What that really means is a cut; when you freeze indexation you actually cut back. We heard from the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, who is quite diverted at the moment. He is packing his bags and looking for a job anywhere else but in the Senate. His colleagues do not want him here and big business do not want him here; they are prepared to send him overseas. He is talking about a $6.8 billion saving. Remember, that $6.8 billion comes out of support for the poorest people in this country. It is an absolute outrage; it is the poor people in this country that are being belted up. The more work that has to be done, as Senator Cormann has indicated, in my view means they will revisit their terrible 2014-15 budget and will continue to work to deliver all the attacks on the poor people of this country that it contained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can the National Party simply be capitulating to these attacks when, in many of their seats pensioners, welfare recipients and unemployed young people are the ones that are going to get hammered? Many of the seats in which workers are going to be hit hardest with cuts to penalty rates are National Party seats. For instance, in Page, retail is the second biggest industry and employs nearly 8,000 local workers. There are 12,200 in retail, food and accommodation, with 7,700 in retail and 4,498 in food and hospitality. Have you heard the local member for Page actually saying, 'Don't cut the penalty rates of tens of thousands of workers in regional Australia'? There has not been a word. The National Party, the sycophants that they are, talk big when they get out in the bush and are lambs when they come in here. They are simply capitulating to the Liberal Party on all these attacks on ordinary families and workers in their seats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are nearly 12,000 workers affected in the Liberal seat of Gilmore. There are nearly 7,000 in retail, which is the second biggest employer in Gilmore. There are over 5,000 workers in other areas that are affected by penalty rate cuts. What did the local member, Ann Sudmalis, say about it? She said it was 'a gift'. She said it was not cutting wages but opening the door for more hours of employment. In a regional area like Gilmore, with almost double the national youth unemployment, she said it is a gift. She said it is a gift for our young people to get a foot in the door of employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the stupidity of the coalition. They think that by cutting the wages of the poorest paid workers in our country, on base annual salaries of $35,000, who depend on their penalty rates on the weekend, they will actually lift their standard of living to a reasonable standard—not even a good one, just a reasonable one. The workers will get a $4,000 cut if their penalty rates go, and there is not a word from rural and regional MPs in the coalition. There is not one word, except to defend the cuts to penalty rates because they have a pathological opposition to workers getting access to penalty rates, decent collective bargaining and decent health and safety on the job through access to their unions. They have got a pathological hatred for the trade union movement. If the trade union movement cannot deliver on wages and conditions in this country, you should understand that minimum rates will never rise and we will end up like the US with no decent welfare system, with no decent underpinning for rates of pay and conditions, and with retail workers having to depend on tips to bring home a decent wage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the type of society that this mob want and that is the type of society that they are delivering day in day out, supported by Pauline Hanson's One Nation, supported by Nick Xenophon and his team and supported by Derryn Hinch. Derryn Hinch—give us a break—is the guy who used to go: 'Shame, shame, shame!' Well, shame, shame, shame on Derryn Hinch because he has never voted for working people on one decent issue in this parliament since he has been here. He is an absolute captive of the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government in absolute chaos and crisis. We have got a Prime Minister who does not have the confidence of his party and does not have the confidence of the nation. He promised so much and has delivered so little. Prime Minister Turnbull is the biggest disappointment as Prime Minister that anyone has ever seen in this country. He has capitulated to the right wing of the Liberal Party. Tony Abbott is still calling the shots.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Turnbull is the weakest, jelly-backed Prime Minister ever. He cannot concentrate on any economic way forward. What has he done? He wanted a capital gains tax. How long did that last? A few weeks. Then he wanted to give powers back to the states. I think that lasted 48 hours. Now he has this idea that they will let people access their superannuation to buy a house. That will simply drive house prices up and will mean that workers will have no decent retirement. The guy is a fraud. The guy is hopeless. The Prime Minister of this country has no standing and this bill is an absolutely disgusting attack on the poorest people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Party sit there—the sycophants that they are, the weak people that they are and the unhelpful people for their own electorate that they are—and give in every time. The National Party are a disgrace. They should be on this side opposing these cuts to their electorates.</span>

                    <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  On it goes. The coalition are continuing to try to hurt the Australians who can least afford it. They are happy to let the big end of town go without paying the tax that they should rightly be paying and are instead attacking the most vulnerable people in our society. That really sums up the ideological bent of this coalition government. It has continued from day one until today. What we see today is a belligerent attempt to ram this Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 through at any cost without any consideration for what came through the recent inquiry into the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017 by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor listened to the evidence provided to that inquiry on the omnibus bill and could reach no other conclusion but to provide a dissenting report. That bill has now been split into two. A lot of that bill is now before us in the bill we are debating. We could not support it. We listened to all of the evidence that was put forward and read the submissions that were put forward that reiterated we should reject the cuts that are included in this bill. Why? Because of their impact on low- and middle-income families. In particular we are talking about single parents, pensioners, jobseekers, young people, people with disabilities, and carers. These are the people that this government wants to attack. These are the people that this government wants to make life harder for. The government does not even acknowledge how hard they are currently doing it yet it wants to make it even harder for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that actually mean? A young person on the Newstart allowance will now have to wait up to five weeks before they can get any kind of income. Where is the fairness in that? Again there are cuts to paid parental leave, leaving 70,000 new mums in Australia worse off. Where is the fairness in that? There is no fairness in the measures that this government puts forward. There is simply pain, suffering and hurt for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. What is having to wait five weeks for the Newstart allowance, forcing young people to live off nothing for five weeks, going to do to homelessness levels in our country? What is that going to do to those suffering mental illness in this country who need the support of their state to do the right thing and provide that safety net for them? Labor will never support such unjust and unfair laws that will hurt the most vulnerable in our society and that is why we strongly oppose and condemn these hurtful changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government needs to find revenue, we are all up for that. We are all up for working with the government in finding the revenue it needs for its budget. We know that as each day passes the government's budget deficit keeps blowing out of control—something you never hear them talking about anymore. It has increased astronomically since 2013, since the Liberals took office. Of course, they do not want to talk about that. They do not want to talk about where they can find genuine savings that do not hurt the most vulnerable in our society, because they do not understand what it means to be vulnerable—at least we know the Prime Minister does not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of the government looking at the big end of town, instead of looking at making sure multinationals pay their fair share of tax, instead of looking at the fact that their ideological corporate tax cut policy is simply ludicrous in providing $8 billion a year more to the budget bottom line by giving corporations a big tax cut, instead of looking at all of that—they do not want to do any of that—they want to go straight to single parents, to people on a disability payment, to people seeking Newstart, to young people, to job seekers and to aged pensioners. They are the people they are focusing on. They are the people that they are attacking. Their way of finding money for the budget is by cutting the basic means by which a lot of these people try to make ends meet, to get that leg up so that they can get back into the job market or make their life decent and meaningful and live with some kind of dignity. It is in fact the dignity that they are taking away from them, and that is absolutely outrageous. It is not something that Labor would ever, ever support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not even stop at some of the measures that are in this bill, even though it is certainly bad enough. What this government has done in relation to cuts to some of the most vulnerable has been going on now for some years. We only have to look at community legal centres, which we know are used by some of the poorest people in the country. Community legal centres turn away around 160,000 people per year due to a lack of resources. Why do they have a lack of resources? They are facing a 30 per cent cut from 1 July this year. Again, the ability to access legal support should be a mainstay in our society. There is also not enough money in that realm for family violence support—something that I think both sides of this chamber agree needs a further focus on so that we can end family violence in this country and its effect on so many women and children. Also, if you look at the clients that access community legal centres, 50 per cent of them receive government benefits. If 50 per cent are receiving government benefits, we know already that they are some of the most vulnerable people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why, I ask, is our government in this country trying hurt the Australians who can least afford it? They are the questions that Australians are asking out there on the streets. They are not asking: 'Gee, we need to reform our Racial Discrimination Act so that we have more of a right to be a bigot. We think our Racial Discrimination Act does not give us enough free speech.' That is not what Australians are talking about on the streets. If the government would actually listen to Australians, hold a town forum like our leader has done on so many occasions and listen to the people, they would find out how out of touch they are. They would find out that the idea of cutting family payments, cutting pensions, attacking the rights of people with disabilities and limiting access to community legal centres and family violence support is not what people want. People want to ensure their government is providing those basic services that governments should provide for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, this government is living in some kind of Canberra bubble where it thinks: 'What are we going to do today? How about we bring the Racial Discrimination Act back on the agenda. It's only been three years since we did it last time. Why don't we bring it back on again? We've got a different Prime Minister now. Maybe we can convince him to move on this.' This is despite the numerous times Prime Minister Turnbull has said he would not make changes to the Racial Discrimination Act. It was a slight moment of wisdom when former Prime Minister Tony Abbott threw out the idea of making changes to the Racial Discrimination Act. He knew the huge backlash that the government was receiving from so many within the community against such changes—changes that go to the heart of the idea of a country based on social inclusion and multiculturalism. But no; instead, we are back here again debating the same old pet issues that the far Right of the Liberal Party seem so fixated on. Now they have new helpers with the 'lite' Liberals in One Nation, who are ready and willing to support them and who are probably egging them on to do so. Labor will not stand for the types of measures that break down the social inclusion of our society. We will not stand by measures that hurt some of the most vulnerable people in our society. That is why in our dissenting report we make clear the fact that we cannot support the majority of savings measures in a bill that have such a massive effect on those who certainly need our protection. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been very constructive. We secured a number of amendments that resulted in the government caving in and dropping its baby bonus payment and amendments that secure $800 million in funding for ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, over five years. We got the amendment for the energy supplement measure to protect those pensioners and people on Newstart allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, very importantly, worked hard to protect Labor's child-care dental scheme—I know that is a scheme used often and importantly so in my home state of state of Tasmania—by having that removed from the legislation. It does not just stop, as I said, at attacking some of the vulnerable people in our community, as this bill does at its very heart. It actually then goes on to attacking children—children who need at the first stages in their lives the best start possible, and that means accessing a dentist. We all know that good dental hygiene sets us up for everything else in life. If you have good teeth and good dental hygiene you are going to then have that opportunity to get a good job and have those opportunities presented to you. Yet that is something the government wants to get rid of. Why? It all comes back to this user-pay system ideology this government is based on. That is, if you have a big, fat wallet you can afford to pay. If you do not, too bad for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That dog-eat-dog attitude is not Australia. It is not the Australian way. It may be the American way. We all know how their health system has gone down and the attempts made by former President Barack Obama to change it. But that is not the Australian way. The Australian way is that we provide for all. We provide a safety net for all. That is what Medicare was about and what Labor provided. That is why we have Medicare. That is another piece of public policy legislation that this government has tried to attack. These are the things Labor stands solidly for. That is why I am proud to be a member of the Labor Party—we stand up for people. No matter your background, no matter where you come from, no matter where you live and no matter your circumstances, you should be able to have the same opportunity as someone else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we stand for a good, decent public education system. This morning I was so proud to join my Labor caucus colleagues outside the front of Parliament House with our leader, Bill Shorten, and our deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, to stand up for Gonski. This government certainly does not want to talk about the Gonski reforms because, again, it does not suit their ideological agenda that if you have a big wallet and lots of money you can pay, and if you do not it is too bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are they in government for? To me, the whole idea of being part of my party and being in government is to provide for people. It is to provide that basic safety net for people and to build our economy. They are the two things that make our country work. One would think the government would have some understanding of that because it went to the last election with a slogan of 'jobs and growth'. Do not talk about jobs and growth anymore. If we look at jobs, we do not want to go near jobs because they are attacking jobs. They are attacking penalty rates for some of the lowest-paid workers in the country—retail workers and hospitality workers—and it will affect some 700,000 Australians. So jobs are out the window because jobs are something they want to attack; they do not care about them anymore. As for growth, growth is not going to happen because, again, they are cutting the fundamentals for some of the most vulnerable people in the country, so they are not going to be able to spend money. That is not going to add to our economy; that is going to limit their opportunity to even get a job. You will not hear 'jobs and growth' from this government anymore because they have completely lost the plot on that one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have completely lost the plot full stop. That is why yesterday, on Harmony Day, the government picked out of its hat the reintroduction of the debate on racial discrimination and watering down protections against race hate speech. If this government had some kind of plan for the country or some kind of agenda for this country they would not be just picking here and picking there or introducing bills here and introducing bills there—bills that do not get through this place because, of course, there is not much consultation with any of us and also because they do not fit with any plan or any strategy for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is such a disappointment that with the change of leadership this government went through from former Prime Minister Abbott to now Prime Minister Turnbull we have had a shemozzle of any plan for our future. Even those of us on this side of politics thought that things would change. We actually thought we now had a Prime Minister that believed in climate change, believed in marriage equality and actually wanted to make some kind of a difference. Maybe he would even move Australia towards an Australian republic; we knew that once upon a time he certainly invested a lot in wanting to make that happen. But every issue one would have thought Prime Minister Turnbull stood for he has sold out on. He has completely sold out. Now, with this bill, he is selling out on the most vulnerable people in our country. What kind of legacy does he want to leave for this country from his term in office? At the moment, he is going down in history as the biggest fizzer of a Prime Minister that I think we have ever had, and the biggest seller-out of his values. He certainly does not believe, I think, in the things he is doing. He is simply hamstrung because he chooses to be hamstrung by those far right members of his cabinet, party and caucus, and by the fringe dwellers, as I call them, in One Nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the chamber will always stand up for all Australians in the hope that we will win government at the next election and be able to implement some of the ideas, policies and values that Labor stands for and holds. They are ideas, policies and values that we have been consistent on for many years. They are things we debate within our party, within our caucus and with the community. We know we are on the right track because we listen to people and people tell us how they are living and what is important to them. What is important to them is that their kids get a decent education, that they can access affordable health care and that they can get a decent job with decent pay and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />It is not rocket science to go out there and talk to people and find out what is important to them. But this is not something this government wants to do. It wants to live in a little bubble here in Canberra, away from the real people, protected by the walls in this place and instead bring in legislation that is so out of touch to everyday Australians that it is hurting them. We will fight tooth and nail for that legislation not to pass, because we want Australia to be recognised and listened to in our democratic systems. The only way to do that is to prevent the government from getting its way in its strange ideological obsession with the bills that are currently before us today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  I can indicate that I and my colleagues will support this bill, and I want to put this in context in terms of what has occurred. The government's previous measures included a range of cuts involving billions of dollars worth of cuts to family tax benefits, family payments and the like. It would have meant that a sole parent with a low single income of well under $100,000, of below average weekly earnings, depending on how many children they had and their age, would have been hit with thousands of dollars worth of cuts, which could have been quite devastating for that family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a country that is built on migration. One in four Australians were born overseas, and one in two were either born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. The government's previous measures would have meant that those who are migrants would have been disadvantaged by having benefits cut off after a certain period if they went to visit family and friends. In many cases, that is the final journey that people take to say goodbye to their loved ones in another country. We resisted those changes because of the very clear representations made by those in multicultural communities in this country. I thought that resist those changes was a fair thing to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also issues in respect of the pensioner education supplement. I know that ACOSS and Cassandra Goldie, and many others, raised concerns about the impact of those cuts to the tens of thousands of Australians who rely on that supplement. It is an important supplement in respect of their educational advancement—learning new skills and being able to advance their ability to work in the workforce. That is something that we said was a measure that went too far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also the issue of the energy supplement. Notwithstanding that the carbon tax was removed, energy prices in this country are going up and up; and they are going up because of the absence of a descent energy policy in this country. For many years, I have advocated that the cheapest and most efficient way to reduce carbon pollution to ensure that we meet our Paris agreement targets would be to have an emissions intensity scheme. I and the now Prime Minister, when he was opposition, commissioned Frontier Economics to design a scheme which we thought was a smarter approach than that of the former Labor government. The great paradox is that, back then, Labor called it a mongrel of a scheme but, since then, has had the position that that scheme is 'top dog', that it is the best way to pursue an effective carbon emissions policy which will also ensure energy security and reduce prices. Unless we had something like that in place, where we actually saw a reduction in energy prices for consumers, then I cannot countenance removing that supplement whilst energy prices are so high and going up and up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw in relation to the omnibus bill prior to negotiations with the crossbench was a series of measures that would have hit many families very hard. The counterbalancing issue is: how do you pay for the $1.6 billion package of childcare reforms—a worthy package that will help hundreds of thousands of families in this country—and all the good things child care does for our social fabric? That is a vexed issue. The tax cuts that were supported by the opposition, which were opposed by the Greens and by my colleagues and I, were worth $4½ billion for those earning over $80,000 a year. It would have been better for those tax cuts not to have gone through. That would have been a much better fiscally responsible approach, in my view, but I had to deal with the envelope provided to me by the government. In other words, the government would not countenance tax increases in relation to these measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of negotiations with the government, we have come up with an approach that leads to a freeze in indexation for two years. That is the principal measure. That means people will not get an increase in their family tax benefit for a period of two years. We are in a low inflation environment, and it is something that is more tenable than if we were in a high inflation environment. It means people would not be any worse off in terms of the actual income that they are receiving. That is important. It also means that many families would be better off because of the improved childcare package, which I think strikes that balance. This is not ideal but in my view it is the 'least worst' option in dealing with these issues in a way that would not cause severe hardship to many thousands of families as was proposed in the omnibus bill. So I believe it is a significant improvement and much more equitable than the previous measure that the government was pushing. The alternative would have been a stalemate. The alternative would have been a childcare package that would have been held up. As imperfect as this solution is, I believe it is the best solution given the circumstances and given the constraints that we have had in negotiating with the government in respect of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that this bill is a significant improvement on what we had previously. I believe it is much more equitable, and it has removed the worst aspects of the impact that the omnibus bill would have had on families and particularly on sole-parent families. For that reason, we support it. We have made it clear that we support this bill for the second reading stage, and particularly for the committee stage, not being constrained. If the Senate wants to debate this all day today, tomorrow, the next day and into the weekend, we will not support any restriction on the debate for this bill to be dealt with and for questions to be asked in the committee stage. That is something that I think is important to deal with substantive issues in respect of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is our position. We believe that this is a breakthrough that will ensure that a childcare package that is broadly supported in this place will proceed. It will minimise the impact on families around the country, and it will be a much fairer package of measures than was previously proposed by the government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  We know that this government is utterly incapable of consulting before putting forward legislation, but what a sadly disappointing situation we find ourselves in today, and what an utter, utter farce it is. Labor does not oppose the orderly dispatch of government business, but this government is forcing Labor to debate a bill that we have only had for half an hour or so. I have only had it for half an hour or so. They are so badly disorganised on that side that, you will note, there are no government speakers. They are so disorganised that they do not know what they are doing. They have capitulated. They have done a deal somewhere with the Nick Xenophon Team, which I am very disappointed about, and One Nation, which does not actually surprise me, to debate a bill with half an hour's notice. We have had this bill for half an hour. It is an utter disgrace. They want us to agree to the bill that they did not even have last night, when they were doing deals on it. I would love to know what the deals are; I am sure eventually we will find out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we were supposed to be debating this morning was the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Childcare Reform) Bill. The government has now finally, after being taken kicking and screaming, decided to split that bill. So now we are debating, as I said, an entirely new bill—a bill that has not faced the scrutiny of a Senate committee, that has not had public input and, as I said, that on this side we have only just seen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to sit till midnight tonight, probably till midnight tomorrow night and probably into Friday because the government have to be taken kicking and screaming when they change their mind on something. When they finally capitulate on something that we have been telling them for months is a bad idea and that we were not going to support, they go off, do their shonky little deals and then come in here and say, 'Right, this is what we're debating now.' But when we want to debate penalty rates they say, 'Oh, no, can't debate that.' That is taken off the agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am wondering if anyone remembers that when the government first got elected they made a couple of promises, and those promises were no cuts to health and no cuts to education. But now they are cutting assistance to families in a secret way, as I said. They have done their secret little deals that we do not even know about. Australia has record low wages and penalty rates are being cut, as are payments that low-income families rely on to fund childcare packages, all making life more difficult for many Australians. I have to ask again: what is the deal that is being done with One Nation and the Nick Xenophon Team. I cannot believe that One Nation do not care that a third of families will be worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants us, as I said, to immediately debate these cuts. I have been here for a number of years. This is my ninth year, and I know that the process of the Senate can be difficult to follow for everyday Australians. But I want to make it very clear to everybody listening out there that today we are expected to debate and to vote on legislation before the Labor Party have been given a chance to look at it properly. These are changes that can hurt families and pensioners. Without the ability of this chamber to properly review and stop these changes, that damage can be very, very bad. It is not a fair go. In fact, I would go so far as to call it an act of political bastardry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation say they are a party of the fair go. Well, they are not. They are puppets to this government, and any pensioner, single parent or low-income family thinking of voting for One Nation or the Liberal Party needs to take a really hard look at the cuts the government wants, and they need to say, 'No, One Nation and the Nick Xenophon Team are not acting in the interests of my family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had some disappointments in this place. I have had legislation go through that I have not agreed with. But I have never been so disgusted as I feel today. I am at the stage where I think, 'What else will the government do?' We know they have made lots and lots of bad decisions, and they have to be taken kicking and screaming every time because 'sorry' is obviously not a word in their vocabulary. They cannot admit to mistakes, but they will do shonky side deals to cover up the errors of their ways. Well, I will say this: the Labor party will not ever support changes that hurt families. We will not hurt pensioners, and we will not hurt the most vulnerable in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know where this saying originates, as it has been variously attributed to many historical figures including Albert Einstein, Mark Twain and Benjamin Franklin: 'The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again and expecting a different result.' Well, guess what happens: with this government, that is what happens. I think this government is a little bit insane, because time and time again they attack the living standards of struggling Australian families and expect that the public, and the Labor Party, will fall in behind them. Have they not learnt anything from the backlash to their 2013 and 2014 budgets? Have they forgotten the massive public outcry that made Mr Abbott so unpopular? Are their memories so short?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that in question time Senator Brandis has a very short memory. He often has not heard of something, remembered something or read something, but the whole of the government's side cannot all have such short memories. Rather than learning from their past mistakes and dropping their attacks on vulnerable Australians, Mr Turnbull and his Liberal Party have had the gall to ramp up their attacks. They tried to introduce, into this place, a bill which was unprecedented in its savagery, a bill which was an all-out assault on families, new mothers, pensioners, students and young job seekers. I think the Australian public would be very sensible to carefully watch the cruel cuts that the government keeps trying to implement and to stand up against them, like they did to the cuts in the previous budget. I call upon the Australian people to stand up against One Nation and Nick Xenophon and say, 'You betrayed us. You claim to care for the battler, but you are just as cruel and as unfair as the Liberals.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely shameful that the government would link these cruel and savage cuts to investments in an area such as child care. In the previous bill that is what it was doing. Just to be very clear to everyone: childcare funding issues were related to the whole of the bill. For years this government has failed to deliver any child care relief. I should know about child care. I worked as an early childhood educator for 12 years before I came to this place, so I know a little bit about child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the package's original announcement in 2015, the government has said they would not pass their childcare package unless cuts to family payments were first passed by the parliament. Since 2015, they have been saying that, and we have opposed the linking of childcare reform to cuts to families ever since it was first announced. It is unfair, it is unjust and it is simply a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul—but making sure that Peter has no support whatsoever. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between the original bill—the Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform Bill, which we were supposed to have been debating until an hour or two ago—and this bill there are definite links. With that bill that we were due to debate, the government was holding not just families to ransom to pay for child care but also pensioners, young Australians and new mothers. The bill would have ripped $5.6 billion from the household budgets of low-income Australians. The bill would have taken more than $3.30 a week from pensioners, families, new mums and young Australians for every $1 in proposed childcare assistance. I am not sure whether those on the other side are unknowing or unfeeling. I am often conflicted about this, about whether this government does not know what impact their changes will have on the least well off in our community or whether they simply do not care. We will stand up for low-income and middle income Australians, as we have done since this government began its attack on them in its cruel budget of 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add insult to injury, in the original bill the government admitted that its family payment cuts would leave 1.5 million Australian families worse off. Families that were going to lose their family tax benefit part A supplements would be $200 worse off per child, and families receiving family tax benefit part B would lose $350 each year. What those on the other side do not understand is that these cuts add up for families who are struggling to make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the previous linking of the childcare reforms in the package. Having worked, as I said, for 12 years in that industry, I am amazed that this government would even consider linking a childcare package to reform, in that sense. As everybody knows, child care is one of the most important issues that the government needs to deal with. We have all heard the old saying 'give me a child until they are five'—some people say give me a child until they are seven—'and I will show you the adult.' That is where the importance of child care comes in. To cut the hours in which children are able to access child care is completely self-defeating. I do not get why the government would want to do that. Child care and access to child care are so important that it should have been its own bill all on its own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not saying that there are not things that need changing in the childcare sector; I think there are things that need changing. If they want to reform the childcare sector, I would like to see childcare workers get paid more, for starters. I would like to see childcare workers being acknowledged for the hard work that they do. I would like people in this chamber to stop making comments about childcare workers just wiping noses and stopping fights, as has been said. Surely, to any parent their child is their most important and most valuable asset. Their child is the most important thing to any parent. Surely, in that case, all parents would want the best for their child. But this government looks at things like cutting access to child care and halving the amount of hours for which some children can access child care. It just makes me shake my head.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government would rather take money from the pockets of pensioners, jobseekers, people with disability, new mothers and families than make multimillionaires pay their fair share of tax. We have all seen how happy they are to give big business a $50 billion tax cut. It is the one thing that they will not renege on; it is the one thing they will not go backwards on. I am sure they will try to do a deal with people on it. I just say, 'Why?' Why would the government even think that when you have people in need and when you have people struggling? It is atrocious, and Labor will not stand by and let this happen. We will continue to fight any of these cuts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will oppose the areas of the original bill. The cuts were cruel. It is pretty shameless the way the government have come in here today with only an hour or so for us to have a look at the bill. In fact, I did not even get an hour to look at the bill before standing here today. They do deals with the One Nation team and the Nick Xenophon Team. We do not know what those deals are yet. I am sure eventually we will find out and eventually it will all come to the fore and you will all be able to see what you have been sold out for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we support reform of the childcare industry in some areas—we certainly support additional investment in child care—but we do not support it being held to ransom. This government is more committed to cuts that will hurt pensioners, families, new mums and young Australians, than they are to delivering on their promise of increased childcare assistance. A wide range of organisations have called on the government to drop the cuts to family tax benefits, but the government simply has not listened. Despite hearing warnings about the serious flaws in the childcare changes for years, they have done nothing to fix them. An analysis by the ANU shows that these childcare changes, the ones in the original bill, will leave one in three families worse off: 330,000 families would have been worse off and 126,000 would be no better off. That is almost half of all families—555,000 families—that will be worse off or no better off. Over 71,000 families with an income below $65,000 will be worse off. The harsh activity test will leave children in 150,000 families worse off. I have not had a chance to look at the new separated childcare bill so I will be reading that with avid interest, but if it is anything like what was in the omnibus bill, I will be very disappointed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants to cut access to early education in half for many vulnerable and disadvantaged children and wants to, effectively, cut access for families earning less than $65,000 from two days a week to one day. Cutting access to early childhood education will only exacerbate problems. Early childhood education needs to be recognised for its powerful ability to solve social problems and to address disadvantage in the long term. I just do not think this government gets that. I think they see the big end of town and think: 'Let's not touch them. They're our friends. We need to look after them.' And they see children, people on pensions, unemployed people and new mums as targets. And they do not mind targeting them, let me tell you. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things I am worried about too is the impact that the government's changes will have on Indigenous children. In every state and territory Indigenous children already have lower early childhood education enrolment rates than average. These services are often small and in remote locations and they will not be financially viable without ongoing support. Deloitte Access Economics have found that changes to the budget-based funded program will disadvantage Indigenous children. Fifty-four per cent of families will face an average fee increase of $4.40 an hour, 40 per cent of families will have their access to early childhood education reduced, and over two-thirds of Indigenous early childhood education services will have their funding cut. Do you know what that means? That means that the potential of those children to make a smooth transition to school will be diminished. That is what that means. And that will compound the likelihood of intergenerational disempowerment and unemployment. They will not be that interested in school. They will not have had the start that other kids can get. It is well known that, if you put money into those very early years, where children can enjoy the environment and learn through play, they are more likely to enjoy school. I just do not understand why this government wants to make it harder for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will have children falling behind before they have even started school and they will be at greater risk. What else did they have in the omnibus bill? I am going to run out of time to tell you all the things that I thought were bad in the omnibus bill. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on a bill that we know very little about, because we did not even have it as the government was introducing it. I had to run up the end of the chamber to try and get a copy. It was the only copy. I got the Clerk's copy. It was the only copy I could get my hands on. And now we are debating it. Great! We know nothing really about the impact of some of these measures. Yes, some of the omnibus measures are recycled from before, the so-called 'zombie measures'. But the changes to the family tax benefit—Senator Xenophon said, 'This might be slightly better than the other changes that were being made to family tax benefit'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the fact is that we just do not know, because it has not been to an inquiry. They are putting a blanket indexation freeze on family tax benefit payment rates. I will come back in a minute to other contributions from some of my colleagues trying to justify why we should be supporting a bill that we have had no time to look at and no Senate inquiry about, why we should be passing that right now—feeble attempts to justify doing that to enable childcare measures to be debated. That, of course, has now been split off. We are going back to the original childcare bill that the government introduced, and we will obviously be debating that at some stage over the next couple of days and looking at what the government are prepared to fix in terms of some of the flaws that are in that particular bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the proposition here is still that we should make families suffer and young people suffer. We should basically effectively cut Newstart—and I will come to that in a minute—so we should make all the people who are currently trying to exist on the very poor rate of Newstart keep existing on that poor rate for longer. It is trying to justify again why the government is targeting vulnerable Australians for these savings to pay for child care—in other words, robbing Peter to pay Paul—when there are plenty of other revenue-raising measures that this government should be and could be tackling, such as negative gearing, capital gains tax and more income tax reform. How about not paying the $4 billion that it is paying to high-income earners in tax cuts? How about we start there rather than taking—what are we talking about—$5.5 billion over the medium term out of the family tax benefit? How about we do that? How about Senator Xenophon and Pauline Hanson's One Nation think about those sorts of revenue-raising measures instead of attacking, again, some of the most vulnerable members of our community?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us get to the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, which we have had limited time to consider. The government say that they have secured 'further savings of $2.4 billion'. This is in the minister's second reading speech, which was tabled—and which is not even two pages, folks—to justify these cuts and justify this approach. What they are doing is taking three of the omnibus measures. They are 'maintaining free-income areas and means-test thresholds for certain payments and allowances'—in other words Newstart and a couple of other payments. They are 'automating'—and doesn't that send shivers up your spine, folks?—'the income stream review process', which will lead to improvements, they claim, in 'the accuracy of income support payments and reductions in consumer debts'. What we have seen so far in automation is an increase in people getting debt notices, many of them inaccurate, of course. They are 'extending and simplifying ordinary waiting periods for the parenting payment and for youth allowance', and then of course we have the cuts to the family tax benefits. I will come back to all those measures in a minute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us just focus, yet again, on where the government wants to really go, and that is evidenced from the omnibus cuts. I do not know what genius in the government came up with the approach: 'We want to do something about child care. We want to reduce paid parental leave, PPL. Let's tie it in with a whole lot of these zombie cuts, and maybe Australians won't notice that we're trying to cut at least $5 billion from various forms of income support, from our social safety net, and trying to use child care and paid parental leave as an excuse to do that.' Fortunately, Australians and this place saw the massive problems with that approach and saw what the government was trying to do. Unfortunately, Senator Xenophon and Pauline Hanson's One Nation have now caved in and agreed to still rip, in the first instance, $2.4 billion worth of funding out of our social safety net, but it actually goes much higher than that, because it goes up to $5.5 billion over the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For this particular measure, the family tax benefit, the government is including 'a new schedule to maintain the current family tax benefit payment rates for two years at their current levels from 1 July 2017'. The government is saying that it will result in savings in the first instance of $2 billion over the 2017-18 forward estimates and then build to $5.5 billion over the medium term. In other words, that money is coming at the expense of families in this country. But, wait, there is a little bit more. The government says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that under this … measure there will be no cuts to family tax benefit payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there will be cuts into the future! The government is taking $2 billion worth in the medium term out of family tax benefits. That is out of the pockets of families in this country. And who does it hurt the most? Of course, vulnerable families, families on low incomes, young families, single-parent families—that is who it hurts the most. 'Oh, but don't worry; you get it back in child care.' No, they do not. They will not get equal value back in child care. Certainly single-parent families, for example, who have children who are not in early years education do not, by and large, access the childcare system so will not get those benefits back but will suffer the cuts to their incomes. When you are on a low income, every dollar this government cuts has an impact on your income. This money is not coming out of thin air; it is coming at the expense of families in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then the government is taking $69 million worth of funding—or it is suggesting it will save that sort of funding—by maintaining the income-free area and the means-test threshold for certain payments and allowances 'at their current levels for three years'. What that means is that people who are on Newstart—remembering that Newstart already means that people are living below the poverty line; it should be significantly increased, and we have been campaigning for that for years—will effectively have less money as this measure kicks in and the income thresholds remain the same. It means they will have less money in their pockets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, this government is doing over the most vulnerable members of our community, people who are struggling, literally, to put food on their tables, because food is seen as a discretionary item. People have to pay their rent. They have to pay their power bills. They have to pay their water bills. You are not really able to negotiate all those things, other than negotiating the payment period sometimes—let this bill run for a little bit while you pay that one; that one is arrears, so then you have to pay it. But you can actually decide not to buy food. That is why it is called a 'discretionary item' and that is where, we know from the evidence, people make cuts. Repeatedly, people have come before Senate committee after Senate committee, telling us, presenting us with the evidence, that what parents do is make sure that their kids always get to eat, but the parents go hungry. They are the ones who do not have meals. They are the ones that skip meals. So we know that that has a direct impact on people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know also from the evidence that poverty is a barrier to employment. Here is the government once again blaming 'bludgers' and having a go at people because they cannot find work—which is why they wanted to try and keep young people off work. The excuse is, 'We will try and just make them work a little bit harder to find a job.' They obviously still do not get that there are not enough jobs out there for young people, who keep trying and trying. It is not because they do not want to work; it is because they cannot find work. Fortunately, that disgusting measure in the omnibus bill is off the agenda for the time being. The government need to hear what the Australian people are saying—that they think that is unfair—and never bring back that zombie measure. Call it dead and buried so that they do not continue to attack young people with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure, however, will impact on young people, because they will also be subject to this freeze on income-free areas and thresholds. Single parents will also be subject to it—single parents that the last few successive governments have kicked off parenting payment and onto Newstart, which has already had a significant impact on payment rates and their ability to work and support their families. There was another go at them through the cut to family tax benefit. Now this measure will have an impact on, literally, the money they have in their pockets. That is $69 million coming out, again, of the pockets of those most vulnerable members of the community who are unemployed, who are trying to survive on Newstart or other allowances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure is automating the income stream review process, which, according to the government, 'will lead to improvements in the accuracy of income support payments and reductions in customer debts'. Well, that has been a brilliant success for Centrelink so far, hasn't it! It has been so successful that we have a Senate committee inquiry to look at the massive problems that are going on. Why would we move to automate anything else until we solve the massive problems that we have with the Department of Human Services and with Centrelink? Not only do we have the evidence, over the last couple of months, of the massive failure of Centrelink's automatic debt-recovery process; we also have the Auditor-General's report that came out a couple of weeks ago that shows Centrelink's failure in trying to apply the previous compliance measures. We have plenty of evidence to show that this measure should not be contemplated until those issues that have caused massive problems are addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the third measure: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Extending and simplifying ordinary waiting periods for the parenting payment and for youth allowance for a person who is not undertaking full-time study and is not a new apprentice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This means that, if you are applying for a parenting payment, you have a new ordinary waiting period. The very nature of the term 'parenting payment' means that there are children involved. So, what the government is saying is that that waiting period now has to apply to parenting payments. They are going even further than that, saying in the explanatory memorandum:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Schedule also provides that the current exemption on the basis of severe financial hardship will only apply if the person is also experiencing a personal financial crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, they have upped the bar. Not only is there the ordinary waiting period but the bar has been raised for exemptions. In fact, it has been raised so high that, by the time you gather all the evidence for it, you are through the ordinary waiting period anyway. In other words, you have been subject to this period of no income support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of corollaries to the exemptions, such as if the person who makes the claim has been affected by domestic violence in the four-week period before they make the claim. Anybody who knows anything about domestic violence knows that in most cases it has been happening repeatedly and it takes someone a long time to leave the home. There are many factors that stop somebody leaving a situation where domestic violence is involved. So it may take somebody longer than that four-week period since the last episode to, for example, leave and find somewhere to go. There are so many issues involved in that very complicated situation that it is, quite frankly, obscene that the government is trying to make people wait an extra week. It means that the government will save $184 million on the backs of parents who need support for themselves and, most importantly, obviously, for their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That measure is one of the omnibus measures that certainly should not have been supported. And, quite frankly, I am surprised that Senator Xenophon is trying to use the excuse that this, along with some of the other measures, is slightly better than the omnibus cuts. It is just not on. He is just not right. These will significantly impact on families, on single parents, on young people and on older Australians. A third of the long-term unemployed now are over the age of 45; they are trying to survive on Newstart. So this also impacts older Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have been fair; they have managed to have a go at all Australians. But they are having a go at the most vulnerable—vulnerable parents, single parents, and young families on low incomes will be particularly affected, along with young people and older people that make up large cohorts of those on Newstart—and having another go at parents and single parents in particular by making them wait an extra week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will not be supporting these measures. We will not be supporting cutting, over the medium term, $5.5 billion out of family tax benefit payments that support vulnerable people. We do not know the impacts this will have, because—guess what?—it has not been to a Senate inquiry. We reported on the other measures through a very short Senate inquiry into the omnibus bills. Some of the measures we have just been talking about were the subject of a Senate inquiry, but this one, which will take out $5.5 billion over the medium term, has not been to a Senate inquiry. That is why I move the following second reading amendment to this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add "and the bill be referred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 8 May 2017".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be able to look at what impact this freeze on payment rates for two years will have on families. Over the medium term, $5.5 billion will have a significant impact on the families of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to be looking at the total of the impact of these measures on vulnerable Australians: on young families, on single parents, on young people, on older Australians—all of whom are affected by these measures. When you look at the omnibus bill and you look at the impact of some of these measures—for example, on single parents—you must look at it cumulatively. You cannot look at some of these measures in isolation, because the impact on people adds up. For example, some of the single parents that were affected by a number of the measures in the omnibus bill were going to be $50 a week worse off. For people who are struggling on a low income, $50 a week is a hell of a lot of money. It means that they have to make even tougher decisions about what payments they can afford to make for school excursions, extra little treats, school uniforms, paying the rent, paying the power bills. All of these things are affected by these measures that put people out of pocket by $50 per week. These cuts will occur at the same time the government is busy processing the cuts to income tax for wealthier Australians. It is refusing to address issues like negative gearing and capital gains, which would not only mean that it has more money but also help to address the issue of housing affordability, which also affects the cohorts of people that we are talking about here. The measures in this bill are not justifiable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government keeps talking about 'bloated welfare bills' in those and similar terms. We do not have overspending on income support. We have a well-targeted income support system. Our social safety net is much more well targeted and we spend less as a percentage of GDP than many, many other countries in the OECD. That there is overspending is a myth made by the coalition government because it does not support an adequate social safety net. It is intent, through its repeated cuts to it, on ripping great big holes in our social safety net. It is trying to con Australians into thinking that there is this massive spend, when the money that is spent is ensuring that people get better support, that should guarantee that they are not living in poverty, that those barriers to employment are not there, that it is doing what it is meant to do, support vulnerable Australians in periods of crisis—when they are unemployed and when the single parents need support. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  In rising to support the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, Australia Conservatives feel it is necessary to point out that successive Australian governments have been living beyond their means. There is a time when we have to arrest that dramatic erosion of fiscal responsibility. That can only be addressed by making savings in government expenditure. There are those, and we heard one of them on the other side in Senator Siewert just then, who say, 'That's not necessary. This is unfortunate. It's going to have detrimental impacts on some people who can least afford it.' But the idea, the very concept, that somehow we can get by without addressing the spending problems of successive governments and pretend we do not have a moral obligation to our children and successive generations to deliver them a financially responsible balance sheet is an appropriation of our responsibilities in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt at all that the last 10 years have done an enormous disservice to our children. There is now close to $500 billion worth of net national debt, when in 2007, at the ascension of the Rudd spendthrift government, there was zero net national debt. Five hundred billion dollars has been racked up because governments would not address spending commitments over the last decade or so. That is $90,000 for every child in this country today, and yet the people on the other side of the chamber refuse to accept any responsibility for it. They do not want to address it. Their answer is to tax people. Well, my response to that is that people are taxed enough already in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have high rates of taxation. But we have even higher rates of spending, because people are not mindful of the obligations we have to the next generation. This bill, whilst it can be criticised as not going far enough or targeting the wrong people, takes a very modest step in the direction of returning our current account and our balance sheet by repaying some debt and having government live within its means. This has modest savings of $2.4 billion over the forward estimates. Part of that comes from the freezing of indexation in regard to family tax benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the freezing of indexation, including the freezing of indexation when it comes to politicians' pay, which, most notably, only half a dozen of us supported in this place yesterday. The rest said, 'We don't want to freeze indexation of our pay; we just want the dollars to keep rolling in.' I find that a tad hypocritical, that we can say we want to stop families from getting indexation for their family tax benefits, but we don't want to stop politicians from having their pay frozen until the budget is returned to surplus. There is a huge disconnect between the rhetoric that happens in this place and what is delivered outside of the beltway.</span>

They have high utility bills, brought about, might I add, by inane and stupid government policies—most notably in South Australia where the Weatherill government has adopted Labor's mantra of having 50 per cent renewable energy targets, which is also the Nick Xenophon Team's mantra. This has delivered the most expensive and unreliable electricity anywhere in the country and it is going to get worse. Rather than admit it is an inane policy and filled with flaws, their cure for climate change is to get big diesel generators in for the summer so that they can turn them on, stop the blackouts and run diesel generators to make up for the shortfalls in wind and solar power. This is how the theoretical concept of those on the political left—and, unfortunately, often supported by those without too much brainpower on the political right—results in a huge detriment to the people who have to live with these concepts that come out of this place, the groupthink that sometimes emanates from here. No-one can really defend it. In fact, in South Australia, when it comes to electricity, every political party is now saying it is someone else's fault. They are blaming the feds, they are blaming the states, they are blaming whoever. The Liberal Party in South Australia supported all of these programs, supported blowing up the coal-fired power stations, and they are now saying, 'It's got nothing to do with us'. We are on a hiding to nothing when people do not have principles applied to some of the major challenges that we face in our country today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just about electricity. It is about returning our budget into surplus so that we can pay back the $500 billion worth of debt that has already been accumulated; so that government can stick to its knitting, which is about defence and ensuring that we have reliable and efficient laws in this country; and so that we can assist those who truly require assistance because they are unable to help themselves. That does not mean giving money to dead people, as Mr Rudd did. That does not mean giving money to foreign backers or people who live overseas, as Mr Rudd did. That does not mean borrowing money from future generations and asking them to pay back the largesse that we are enjoying today because we do not want the impact on our lifestyles. The reality is that we are on a trajectory from which there will be no return unless it is arrested very, very soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I regret to say that by the time I finish in this place—unless I can grow the Australian Conservatives well past the single parliamentary member it has now and we can actually put a stop to some of this inanity—I suspect we will have $1 trillion worth of net national debt before my term expires in five years' time. That is a tragedy for our future generations. And yet the only thing we hear from those on the other side, the supposed alternative government and their alliance partner of the Greens, is that we should be putting taxes up, which of course will only shrink the economy over the longer term, and that we should be giving people more money. I am here to say it has got to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest thing we could do in this country would be to cut taxes, to allow people to be responsible for themselves, to have more self-reliance. And for those people who are concerned about capital gains tax exemptions and negative gearing and those principles that have been applied for many, many generations, for those people who want to cut back on those rorts, the greatest you can do it is to remove the tax encouragement and incentives for it. You do that by having lower tax rates. The reason people pursue tax breaks is because they feel they are paying too much tax already. Of course the incentive is diminished if you are paying a fair and reasonable amount of tax. The big problem we have is that not enough people in this country are chipping in with their tax bill: some people because they are living off the system, because this place and the programs that come out of it encourage them to, but many people are pursuing tax schemes, which they are allowed to do entirely legally, because of the punitive rates of tax that are applied. The Australian Conservatives think there is a better way. If you lower taxes, you provide less support to those who have jobs and do not need them. You can provide greater support, or sufficient support, to those who are truly in need, including the unemployed and families. You can rejig the family tax benefit system through the tax system by income splitting or by tax free thresholds. You could reform child care by allowing it to be tax deductible rather than subsidised. You could stamp out the rorts in child care, which shamefully have been allowed to continue for far too long. There are any number of ways we can cut our cloth to fit our purse, and that is very important for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When those on the other side have no solutions about making cuts to the budget, because it might upset one of their focus groups or their special interest groups, the only answers they have is to put taxes up. My response to that is it is short-term thinking; it is thinking that will diminish our competitiveness and our economy. We need to think about cutting the size, scope and reach of government so that we can support those truly in need. That is why Australian Conservatives are happy to support this bill. In many areas it does not go far enough; I think there are many more areas of tax savings we could accommodate. But the government is grasping for the branch that is within reach. That means it is going to save $2.4 billion over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, they also withdrew from their previous incarnation of this bill a decision to increase family tax benefit rates to offset in part the phase-out of the FTB supplements. This is a significant change because it saves a further $2.3 billion over the forward estimates period and, over the medium term, arrests a potential $11 billion future expenditure. It is uncomfortable—people do not like it and it is going to affect individuals—but it is simply impossible for us to make the changes that are necessary without impacting individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in this country needs to do their bit. I would suggest that those on the top marginal tax rates are already doing their bit by paying nearly half of their income over a certain threshold in tax. Those who as a consequence of this bill are taking haircuts on some of the benefits they may receive will also be doing their bit. But those on the other side of the chamber do not want anyone to feel any pain. They do not want those who are wearing the greatest burden of tax to have any relief from that. They just want to put taxes up and up, thinking that will solve the problem. But it does not solve the problem, and history as a guide demonstrates that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the same wilful ignorance of history that has allowed those on the other side of the chamber to say that our debt problems are temporary, that they are going to be fixed. It is like a magic pudding, a fairytale of economics, and somehow the problems we are creating today are going to be solved at some point in the future. That is exactly how massive problems start—whether it be personal addictions or spendthrift governments, they all begin with making excuses for the little things. 'I'll just do this little thing now and it'll be okay. We'll fix it up next year.' The time to fix it is upon us, and the only way that I see it can be fixed is for the major parties to have a responsible and principled handbrake, a responsible and principled conscience on the implications of their decisions for future generations. That conscience has to take effect here in the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know we come from different political strands—the Xenophon team, the Hanson team, the Hinch team, the Leyonhjelm team and the Australian Conservatives team—but we have united to say this is an important step forward for our country to save some money. We do not like everything about it, but it does save money. It will assist the government in restoring balance to the budget. It will assist the government in, hopefully, repaying some debt in future years. That is our current crisis. That is our obligation to the people, for whom we are custodians of this country and this economy. It is for our children and their children.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that government decisions are what is making the cost of living very difficult for families. That is notwithstanding the fact that some families are struggling through lack of employment opportunities or through personal circumstances. But the environment for employment opportunities is provided by government. The cost of electricity, while not prescribed by government, is influenced by government policymaking, and that is evidenced by the green experiment in South Australia. It is a Petri dish of their failed green dreams and it is a dud. It has not grown some positive culture; it has created a virus that is infecting the whole country. It is now creeping across to Victoria, where they are about to shut down the Hazelwood power station. We are going to have a massive power crisis in this country directly attributable to federal and state government policies. It is time we woke people and governments up to that. I digress, but part of that is to highlight the fact that we need governments to not only live within their means in spending but also ensure that the long-term implications of policy decisions are considered. That is where I think successive governments have failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There may be some on the other side who want to defend some of those decisions, but I think morally it is very difficult to do so because we have got, as I said, $500 billion worth of debt already accumulated that none of us in this place have any real hope of paying back. We are actually leaving it for the next generation of workers to pick up the pieces. The answer from those on that side is: 'Let's just tax them more.' That is to ignore the reality of economics, the demographics of our country and the process of immigration, which they sustain as well and which is on an unsustainable path and putting pressure on our infrastructure and our social cohesion. All of these things are intertwined. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, we have to take even the most modest of steps to arrest the problems that we are creating. That is why as an Australian Conservative I support this bill, notwithstanding the fact that there are going to be challenges for people who are affected by it. We need to start to deal with the issues that we have created. With that, I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator MOORE:</span>
                    </a>  I must have been so caught up in your arguments about tax and how we should operate in the brave new world that I missed you mention the actual bill that is before us. That is no surprise because most of us seem to have missed the content of the bill in front of us today because we will not see the bill we are debating now—according to the government, for extensive periods of time—until we actually conclude the debate. With due process, the government has brought forward an amended bill. It did not just split the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017. In the series of Senate inquiries over the last three years we have consistently talked about the government's plan to make cuts and savings—and Senator Bernardi did admit that this bill may have some impact on some people. Of course it is very easy to say that when the impact is not on you. In this place as a series of government pieces of legislation have come out around some of the measures we have before us we have talked about the value, the issues and the impact of individual cuts and we have balanced that with the issue behind the cuts, which is to save money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, there is no question that we should be looking effectively to ensure that the budget is in as strong a position as it possibly can be. It is the role of parliament to ensure that governments look at budget processes. We on this side of the chamber have never moved away from that, despite some of the rhetoric that has been thrown across in the series of debates we have had. We have questioned consistently the priorities being put forward by the government, which groups of Australians these savings are going to be imposed on, at what cost, how they are going to be supported through the processes implemented by the changes and then on the other side exactly how much savings we are going to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until this morning we were being told that the necessary savings in the omnibus bill were going to be immediately important for the child-care package. A divide was consciously created by the government between some people in the community on whom the savings would be imposed and those who would benefit. We questioned sometimes the amount of that benefit, but there was a clear divide. Until 9.30 this morning that was the debate we were engaged in. It was the debate in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which I still visit from time to time and did in consideration of the previous bill. That took up a considerable amount of the time of the committee—the thought and the preparation—and the concerns and the contributions of people who gave up their time to come and talk to senators about the legislation in front of them. There were hours of discussion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a relatively short time, as often happens, people were asked to think about the proposed legislation and to give their opinion. Unfortunately, despite people giving their opinions, often there is not much change in what comes to the parliament. Until 9.30 this morning we had not seen much change in what was coming to the parliament as a result of a proposal that the government had followed by producing legislation. In the lower house there was significant discussion around the elements of the bill, the objectives of the bill and why the savings in this bill were absolutely necessary to fund the child-care package. That was the bottom line of the debate we were engaged in until 9.30 this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have two new pieces of legislation in front of this chamber. We know that part of the reason we are here is that we are concerned and engaged in legislation and we have the competence, I hope, to be able to react quickly to what is happening on the floor of the chamber. However, I am not too sure that I have the competence to react as quickly as we are being expected to do on this bill, because it is not just the bill that we had before us split into two. We now have changes to the original bill on savings—and we had not seen these changes until this morning—and elements that had been discussed in the committee over weeks are now no longer there, and no explanation has been given by the government to the wider chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do understand the processes of effective negotiation in this place. That is how we operate. I feel sure that there has been considerable negotiation between the government, crossbenchers and other people who may have interest in this bill, but not with the shadow minister and not with the Labor senators in this place, who have shown genuine interest in the process—genuine interest in the bill. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  I rise to make some comments on the outcome of the Western Australian state election of 11 March in which the Labor Party convincingly won that election. I want to go back to 2008, when I was a candidate myself in the then state election 8½ years ago, and reflect on the reason why the Liberal Party, together with the National Party, ultimately won that election. The question asked by us was: 'What had Labor done in government in the last number of years?' The answer was: 'Nobody could answer the question.' And that is why we swept to victory. The corollary to that was the then Treasurer, Mr Ripper, very proudly said that he did not leave much of a deficit or debt. That was because he did not do anything. One of the highlights is the fact that the only active minister at that time, Minister Alannah MacTiernan, is now back in the Western Australian cabinet, so we can hopefully expect that at least one of the previously failed ministers might be able to achieve something, because then Ms MacTiernan from the other place, now Minister MacTiernan, was indeed a very effective minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I also want to reflect on is that Mr Colin Barnett had made the decision in 2008, after a stellar career in politics in Western Australia, to retire. History records that he delayed that decision, and for the next 8½ years he led a very, very successful government in the state of Western Australia. What is not understood is that in those 8½ years more than the population equivalent of Tasmania, more than 500,000 people, came into Western Australia. Barnett was an outstanding premier. He was a decision maker. Yes, it is the case that debt was run up during that time. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you were on polling booths as I was, the interesting point in that election was that everyone came to associate debt with toxic debt—the Gillard memorial halls, the $900 cheques of Mr Rudd and, regrettably, the pink batts. Everyone was associating debt with bad debt. What did Barnett do in his time as premier? He created assets for the state of Western Australia. When somebody said to me, 'There's too much debt,' I said: 'Which of the hospitals didn't you want built or refurbished in the country and in the city? Which of the road systems didn't you want built? Which of the schools didn't you want built? Which of the other infrastructure projects for which that state has now been set up so well didn't you want?' There is the underground railway. It has taken 100 years for someone to do it. There is the Elizabeth Quay development. I said to somebody the other day that in terms of assets versus liabilities Barnett spent $400 million to bring the river back up to the city, but he has already made $390 million of the $400 million back in land sales. That is what debt is when it is creates assets. Regrettably, of course, the people of Western Australia saw the fact that debt had been built up. They failed to acknowledge that it was debt on the construction of assets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barnett was my minister when I was running a government trading enterprise in the early 1990s. He did not tolerate fools, which is probably the reason why he and I got on so well. I wish him well in whatever role he now takes. If it is back in Toodyay, with his sheep, I will once again be wanting to know the names of the sheep, as I have asked him so often. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also now want to draw attention to what I believe was the other factor related to the Liberal Party losing the election, and that is Western Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s share of GST. It is a factor. When I came into this parliament in 2009, we were getting 88c back in every dollar that Western Australia contributed. The 88c went down to 78c, 68c, 55c, 45c and 38c in the dollar, and eventually it got to 30c in the dollar. What did that cost the people of Western Australia? We lost $4.2 billion in GST this year that should have come to WA. Our deficit was $3.9 billion. Remember: $4.2 billion should have come back in and $3.9 billion was the deficit. Put one against the other and there should be a $300 million surplus. What does that relate to? As Judith Sloan eloquently said the other day—and you and I know this, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, as indeed would the Deputy President, who is in the chamber—for every dollar that Western Australia contributes at the moment we get 30c back. That means every man, woman and child in WA hands over $1,736 to the other states and territories. Let's turn that around, Senator Farrell, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Every South Australian—man, woman and child—gets $1,052 bonus. Every Tasmanian, to Senator Urquhart, gets $1,950. Remember: Western Australians are paying $1,700. Every Northern Territorian gets $10,734. And not to be left out, Senator Seselja, here in the Australian Capital Territory, with the highest incomes and the lowest unemployment in the nation, every ACT resident gets $400 from the largesse of the Western Australian economy and community. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Mr Ben Wyatt, who is the new Treasurer. I know that I am going to step on a few toes here, but at least it is a view that I have, and I share it, and that is that Mr Wyatt is not beholden to the union movement. I make the point—quite fairly, I believe—that so many of the ministers in the new government are themselves from the union movement. You know as well as I do, Mr Acting Deputy President, those have come calling since Mr McGowan has been made the Premier. It is interesting that in my first speech, on St Patrick's Day in 2009, I made comment of Mr Ben Wyatt because he was the shadow Treasurer and a fellow Old Aquinian. At that time, all of the other treasurers of Australia had gotten together around COAG and had excluded the Western Australian Treasurer. It was then that shadow Treasurer Ben Wyatt shared the state Treasurer's disappointment, ' particularly in light of the fact that many of the other states have been enjoying the benefits of Western Australia's largesse'. The now-Treasurer Ben Wyatt went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The States can't successfully come to a common position in negotiations with the Commonwealth when they ignore the State with the fastest economic growth …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do congratulate Ben Wyatt. He and his relation Ken Wyatt are making a great contribution to state and federal politics in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the observation about the sham bid by Mr Stephen Smith at about this time last year, on 14 March 2016. We were asked to believe the elder statesmen John Halden, a friend of mine; Chris Evans, a previous leader of the government here in this place; and Stephen Smith, a past foreign minister apparently decided to confect an opposition to leader McGowan. Anybody who believed that must have believed in the Easter bunny that came along the next Friday. As if three elder statesmen of the Labor Party in WA would stand up and genuinely want to oppose the leader. We all know why they did it: Mark McGowan at the time was seen as being weak and ineffectual, and the only way to make him into a leader was to seem to oppose him. And they did—I will say that—and it was a successful exercise. Stephen Smith, despite every hard effort, was thrust to one side by the Labor caucus, leaving Mr McGowan unopposed as the leader of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely critically important in my view to reflect on the continuing importance of the Western Australian economy to the national economy. Yes, it is the case that the construction phases of the major projects have come to a close or are winding down. That is the case. Gorgon is two-thirds complete. Wheatstone will soon go to their first production of LNG. Roy Hill, the big iron ore mine of the Rinehart Group, is now complete. We know of the excellence of the big construction projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that royalty income to the state of Western Australia did decline and because we have this lag in the grants commission process we found a circumstance in which Western Australia's share of GST declined. When it was established by Costello, Howard and the premiers and chief ministers of the time, nobody believed that one state would get back 30 cents out of every dollar, and that matter has got to be addressed. Whether it is through resources sharing or whether it is through a formula that says the states and territories should be held to account for the capacity to earn revenue and to contain expenditure and to be rewarded or penalised against that, something has got to happen to the grants commission process.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  I cannot let those comments by Senator Back go unchallenged. I just want to reflect on what happened in Western Australia two weeks ago at the state elections. We saw the Liberal Party and its coalition partner, the National Party, completely wiped out. Why? Because the Liberal Party there, like the Liberal Party here, had become completely arrogant and out of touch with the aspirations and the wishes of ordinary Western Australian voters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can absolutely say that the Liberal Party and the National Party were wiped out because in the 59-seat Western Australian parliament the Labor Party now holds 41 seats. I was quite gobsmacked to hear Senator Back stand there and go on and on about how wonderful Colin Barnett was and what a great leader he was. If he was the leader Senator Back has just outlined, surely he would still be in government because he would be popular. Again, it shows the Liberal Party had an opportunity to learn from their mistakes and to listen to voters or to carry on with complete arrogance in the way they did in Western Australia and in the way we see the Turnbull government doing here in this parliament. Labor did not win 41 seats out of a 59-seat parliament because the previous government was so popular and had done such a terrific job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to finally hear a Western Australian senator—indeed, a Western Australian Liberal member—concede that Mr Barnett ran up the debt. Western Australia has a very shameful debt—a massive debt into the billions of dollars. That is because Mr Barnett simply could not manage the expenditure, despite him getting carriage of a public hospital Labor had planned when we were in government, the Fiona Stanley Hospital. It was paid for with public funds and it was a plan to produce a first-class hospital. What did we see with Fiona Stanley Hospital? We saw mistake after mistake and budget overrun after budget overrun to the tune of millions of dollars. That hospital's opening was delayed by more than a year—almost two years—because of the mismanagement by the Barnett government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we saw the children's hospital. The Australian Medical Association is hardly a friend of Labor governments, but it turned on the Barnett government like no other because instead of building a state-of-the-art children's hospital the government has built a hospital that is already too small before it has even opened. That hospital has not opened and we have had scandal after scandal about the Barnett government and indeed the health minister. What did we see? Let's not forget: six of the Barnett ministers lost their seats. When ministers lose their seats I think that tells very clearly that voters in Western Australia had had enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Day, the health minister—again, incredibly arrogant and out of touch with what Western Australians were saying—was responsible for what could only be described as the debacle of the children's hospital, which is still not opened and is plagued with problems. The major contractor was in an open fight with the Barnett government and that is a mess that the Labor government, through the Premier, Mr McGowan, have now inherited. We had cheap asbestos, imported from China, brought onto that site. And guess what? The union actually identified the problem—the union that Senator Back and others on the government side like to malign so much. Only the union stood up when asbestos was found on that site—and it now needs to be rectified by the major contractor to make that hospital safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Medical Association is saying that the brand new children's hospital—which is yet to be opened, is way behind schedule and has a massive cost overrun—is too small. The current children's hospital, which the Barnett government has not spent any money on, continues to be used because of the cost overruns, the poor work that has been carried out on the new children's hospital and the asbestos that has been found on the site—which has to be rectified. In the latest scandal, lead has been found in the water at that hospital—and it also has substandard glass. Minister Day, who lost his seat at the election, is trying to wash his hands of the matter and say it had nothing to do with him. Of course the buck stops with the minister!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The failed projects do not stop there. We have this flash new football stadium just down the road from where I live. Not only was the Premier in an open war with the Eagles about the negotiations for them to use the oval—we are going from bad to worse—but the same faulty glass that was found at the children's hospital was also found at the stadium. Once again, there will be cost overruns. We have a fancy pedestrian bridge across the Swan River—which goes to nowhere—to try and reduce the traffic that will be created by the stadium. With Western Australia now having the highest rate of unemployment in Australia—and that is the legacy of the Barnett Liberal government—you would think they would have manufactured the steel for the footbridge in Western Australia. But they did not. They imported it from Malaysia. And we have just found out that that steel is now delayed. No doubt, when it arrives it will not measure up—like the asbestos we found in the children's hospital, the lead we found in the water in the children's hospital, the faulty glass we found in the children's hospital and the faulty glass we found in the stadium. The steel that is being manufactured in Malaysia—and not giving unemployed Western Australians the opportunity to work on that footbridge—has been delayed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals could learn a lesson, look a little bit humble and actually try and work out what went wrong for them in Western Australia. But no. Judging by the comments that we have heard in here today from Senator Back, we are going to continue to praise Colin Barnett and say what a wonderful leader he was. If he was so wonderful, he would not have had the tsunami of an election result that we saw in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a new Premier, a fresh approach and plans to create employment in Western Australia with a great new team. We won more than 20 seats. We now have 41 of the 59 seats in the parliament. And I am pleased to say WA Labor has set yet another record—for the number of women. Those on the other side could start to look at how we do that as well. Many of the new MPs are women and we have now set a new record for the number of women in the Western Australian parliament. The Labor women outrank the Liberal women two to one. Shame on them! And we hear all the excuses in the world. 'We want to pick women on merit.' And I have heard Liberals say young women are not attracted to politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Well, let me tell you some stories. Amber Jade Sanderson, the new member for Morley is a young woman with young children. She has a son who is about 14 months old. That has not stopped her. Jessica Stojkovski, the new member for Kingsley, has children the same age as Amber's. Having young children has not stopped her. Lisa O'Malley, the new member for Bicton, is another young mum with primary school aged children. I think her youngest is about seven. Having young children did not stop her. Emily Hamilton, the new member for Joondalup is another young woman with young children. Cassie Rowe, the new member for Belmont has two young children under the age of four. Obviously that did not stop her. Rita Saffioti, a re-elected member, has three young children. So it is high time the Liberals started to look at putting women forward. We have 15 MLAs and seven MLCs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  Given the Prime Minister's announcement yesterday that his government intends to try to water down section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act to make it easier to be a racist in Australia, I was bracing myself for <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> today; but, my word, they have absolutely outdone themselves down there at the Q Society gazette. We have the front page. We have the editorial. We have Paul Kelly, Caroline Overington, Chris Merritt, Janet Albrechtsen, Gary Jones, the sketch and the ongoing best of Bill Leak series, with another particularly unfunny cartoon featuring Professor Gillian Triggs. Fair dinkum! Down there at Holt Street, they are celebrating as if they have just stormed the bloody Bastille today, and those self-styled freedom warriors—let's make no mistake—have finally bullied a craven Prime Minister into trying to water down racial hate speech laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that 16—that is 16—articles is more than just a tad excessive; it is actually completely onanistic in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today. There are 16 articles, so we had a quick brainstorm in the office this morning, and I have come up with 16 subjects I reckon <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> should have focused on today rather than their onanistic cacophony of self-congratulation and mutual back-slapping that we have been subjected today. First and foremost is global warming, the most important issue facing humanity today. Second is the decline of coal and the resulting uncertainty for Australia's electricity sector. We have our unconscionable treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. We could have read in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today how civil liberties are under attack through the rise in the national security state and the ongoing erosion of civil liberties and human rights in this country. We could have read about the need for a bill of rights, but, of course, we are not reading about that, because I do not believe <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> supports a bill of rights, even though it styles itself as a great protector of the right to freedom of speech. Why didn't we hear about housing unaffordability and rental stress, particularly for young people? I make the point that they actually did touch on this; it was on page 19, and we had to wade through pages of vomitous pap on 18C before we could get there. What about the threat to global security of the Trump administration? Fair dinkum! There is every likelihood our country is going to get sucked into a war with China in the South China Sea because Donald Trump cannot control himself and there has not been a war in the last century that the US went into that Australia did not blindly follow them into. Where is the focus on that? Nowhere to be seen. There are 16 articles of vomitous pap on 18C. What about coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef? We have just had some science come out on that. But no—nothing on the slow death, caused by the burning coal so beloved of the coalition and, for that matter, the Labor Party, of one of our global natural icons, with all of the myriad beautiful species and, for that matter, human jobs that it supports. What about the appalling rates of Indigenous incarceration in this country? Actually, not making racist jokes about it would be a good start as well. What about the Tasmanian government's plan to open up the high-conservation-value forests for logging, a plan that Senator Duniam would have worked closely on while he was deputy chief of staff to the Tasmanian Premier, Will Hodgman? What about the failure of multinational companies to pay their fair share of tax? I note the difference today in Fairfax, which quite rightly gave prime billing to the outstanding work done by my friend and colleague Senator Whish-Wilson and his efforts to ensure that our banks are held to account for the many issues that they have. What about the disappearance of work-life balance in this country or the runaway success of the inaugural AFL women's season, for example? What about the lack of a Tasmanian team in the national men's and women's football and AFL leagues, something I know Senator Duniam agrees with me on? What about how racist hate speech and structural inequality deny people their human dignity, with significant mental and physical health consequences? There are so many issues <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> could be focused on, but again we see page after page, including the front page and a massive double-page spread in the middle of the Q Society gazette today, basically celebrating what they see as their victory on 18C.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that is all going to turn a bit sombre when the reforms go down in this Senate, which I believe they are overwhelmingly likely to do when they are introduced. I make a prediction here: they will not be introduced into the House of Reps, because the government knows that Liberal members will cross the floor in the House of Reps. Those laws will undoubtedly be introduced into the Senate, where I believe they will go down and meet the fate that they deserve. Of course, when that happens, no doubt they will break out the black obituary borders down there at Holt Street, and we will be forced to sit again through an orgy of mourning and article after article, photo after photo and cartoon after cartoon telling us how freedom of speech is dead in this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKIM:</span>
                  </a>  Okay, I will not do that, but I do want to talk about the front page in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> today, which is basically an attempt to frame up immigrants for the housing price bubble in Sydney. It is a disgusting article. I am tempted to call it dog-whistle journalism, but to be frank it is more like an air raid siren than a dog whistle. It is an appalling piece of racism and gutter journalism. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> and presumably the government, which no doubt dropped this story as an exclusive to Sharri Markson last night, have completely ignored the major drivers of housing unaffordability in Sydney. There is nothing in there about a long-term structural underinvestment in public and social housing. There is nothing in there about all the public handouts to property speculators contained in things like the negative gearing policy that we currently have in this country and the obscene capital gains tax discount, which is also, tragically, tax policy in this country. There is nothing about property speculators leaving houses basically untenanted because they cannot be bothered to go through what they see as the hassle of getting tenants, because their profits are quite reasonable, thanks very much, thanks to the booming house prices in Sydney and the ongoing taxpayer handouts that they get through the capital gains tax discount and negative gearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth reminding <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> that in fact, if you are a property speculator buying your 50th investment property in this country, you get more direct taxpayer subsidy from the government than a young couple trying to buy their first home. It makes me sick, it makes a lot of Australians sick, and it is one of the prime drivers of economic inequality in this country that will end up, ultimately, in shaking the very foundations of our society. I refer members to academic studies that have looked at what brings down civilisations in human history. There are two common factors in the crumbling and collapse of every human civilisation that we know about. One is environmental degradation. Tick, it is happening in front of our eyes. And two is a very big gap between the haves and the have nots in the relevant societies. Again, tick, it is happening before our eyes. I know people will have a little bit of a chuckle and a bit of a smirk about what I am saying, but unless we address environmental sustainability and unless we address economic inequality the foundations of our society will continue to crack. These are now no longer hairline cracks that we are seeing; they are broader than hairline cracks, and they exist right down to the bottom of the foundations of our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am bracing myself for what we are going to see in the Q Society gazette when 18C goes down in this place. I am predicting more than what we saw today, which was most of the front page—an entire double page spread and about half of the editorial page. I think it will be worse. I think the black borders will be pulled out and we will see an obituary for their much beloved love child, 18C reform, and, quite frankly, that is one time I will be celebrating, when the attempt of this government, bullied by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and those editorial writers down at Holt Street into trying to make it easier to be a racist in this country, goes down in the screaming heap that it deserves to go down in.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                  </a>  Thanks, Senator Cameron. We look forward to you moving to Tasmania in the very near future too. Unlike some, I would like to talk about the good things that come out of our state. On Monday, I spoke about our strong medical research capability and the history we have of achievement in that field. While others will talk doom and gloom, and try and create a perception that things are not good in Tasmania at all, I think it is important to try and set the record straight and to go with the Tasmanian community to look forward with optimism rather than just at the challenges we face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I am going to be talking about one of the bright spots in the Tasmanian economy, and that is the tourism sector, which I am sure we are all big supporters of in this place. I made mention of this sector in my first speech for good reason. I believe the importance of that industry to our economy cannot be underestimated. As I say, I do not think any senator from my home state could possibly disagree with me when I say that it is one of the key industries in our state when it comes to employment, because it is one of our competitive strengths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Tasmania is a smaller jurisdiction, by comparison with the larger mainland states, our performance at the annual Australian Tourism Awards is a good indicator of how right we do it down there. We won more gold medals than any other state in the Commonwealth, and I have to add that this is for the third year running. This is from the small state of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the words of the Premier, Will Hodgman, who is a good friend, as Senator McKim alerted to before, but an even better Tourism Minister, 'Tasmania does tourism better than anyone else in the country.' I have to agree with that. He is also right to point out that the strength of the Tasmanian performance, not just at the awards but as an industry in general, comes from the strong relationship between the government and the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to give a hearty commendation to the leaders of the tourism industry in Tasmania. They are people who have worked hard, who have had a vision and worked extremely hard with government and other industry operators to bring about the realisation of our competitive strengths. There are too many to name, of course, but I would like to make particular mention of a few that have worked exceptionally hard over the years to see the growth that we have had in this industry. I will start with Luke Martin, who is the head of the Tourism Industry Council Tasmania. It is led by the chair of its board, Daniel Leesong, and before him the venerable Simon Currant, who would be familiar to many Tasmanians, I am sure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-GeneralIInterjecting">An honourable senator interjecting</span>—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263418" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                  </a>  That is right. The board, the chair and the CEO have all worked tirelessly to realise the tourism potential of our state, and I think they have done great things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also the private investors, who have seen the opportunity to invest in our state and make the most of what we have to offer. People like David Walsh who created the incredible MONA, and the associated festivals and exhibitions, which, quite frankly, have transformed the face of tourism in our state. I do not think anyone can argue with this. There is Rob Pennicott with his wilderness adventures and Brett Torossi with her stunning boutique accommodation properties across Tasmania. The work of these people in the industry, with government, has resulted in the strong performance I have already mentioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nationally, as was highlighted by our federal tourism minister, Steve Ciobo, there has been significant growth across the country, and I am pleased Tasmania is part of that. Nationally, spending by international visitors reached the unprecedented height of $39.1 billion last year. We have seen incredible growth in international visitor numbers from right across Asia and the US. The investment by government in assisting the growth in the tourism sector is vital. The Turnbull government's investment—it is an investment that has been made by many successive governments I must point out—of $639 million to promote this country as a destination, alongside being able to negotiate some of the world's best aviation access agreements and the introduction of visitor visa access improvements, are all aiding this fantastic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, specifically turning to the state of Tasmania and the rate of growth in this piece of paradise, for the first time ever Tasmania has passed the 1.2 million visitors per annum mark. I believe that is an incredible achievement. In opposition—Senator McKim would recall this—the now Premier, then shadow tourism minister, named a target for visitors reaching the state of Tasmania, hoping we would be at 1.5 million visitor per annum by 2020. This target was set on advice from industry. It is important to point out that when the target was set, industry said that when we reached that target we would create an extra 8,000 jobs, particularly in regional Tasmania, where jobs are so badly needed. It is clear though the government is well on its way to achieving this target, given that it only requires a five per cent growth in annual visitor numbers to reach it. In the last year we had a seven per cent growth in visitor numbers to the state, so we are on the way. Further, we have seen an increase in spending of 10 per cent, bringing it to a total of $2.14 billion. So Tasmania on these numbers and by any objective measure is punching well above its weight and I believe this is a great thing for our state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to the importance of tourism to the regions in Tasmania, I have previously made mention of the fact that Tourism Research Australia has previously reported that the east and west coasts of Tasmania, both made up of several regional communities, are the fifth and sixth most tourism dependent regions in the country. That demonstrates just how important good policy and hard work in this area is to the growth of this economy and creating jobs. We saw an 11 per cent increase in visitation to the north of the state, a 10 per cent increase to our spectacular east coast and a seven per cent increase to the equally beautiful Cradle Coast region in the north and the west. Credit also must be given to the steps the Tasmanian government has taken in altering how the ferry service across Bass Strait, the TT Line, operates, focusing now on maximising the number of visitors that utilise the service rather than commercial returns. This change in focus has seen an increase in sea visitors of 11 per cent, and those visitors are arriving in the north of our state where we are seeing more stay and take in what the north has to offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was the case with national statistics about international visitors, the same applies at home in Tasmania. International visitors have grown by 11 per cent. The US is the largest market. And it is on this point, the growth we are seeing from international markets, that the investment made by the Australian government of $38 million in the Hobart International Airport runway extension will be vital to seeing that continued growth in international visitor numbers. In the very near future, we will be seeing direct air freight flights from Hobart direct into Asia, meaning that the fresh produce—the seafood, the berries and cherries, the meat products that the world is willing to pay such a premium for—will more easily make it to market. This is a boon for our local producers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, once the runway extension is completed, I am certain—and I also have it on good authority—that we will see direct charter flights to and from Asian destinations into Tasmania. And hopefully, one day, we will see regular scheduled flights to and from Asian destinations into Tasmania. Although, to continue to be viewed as the 'must-see destination', the Tasmanian government realises the state needs to continue to work with industry and foster the creation of new product offerings—new experiences, new things for people to see and do, new reasons for them to come, or hopefully return for a second, third or fourth trip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so I await with excitement the outcome of the work being undertaken on the Cradle Mountain masterplan. This is one of those developments in a truly spectacular part of the world that I think absolutely needs investment. So I look forward to working with the Tasmanian tourism industry, including the Cradle Coast Authority, to see that the required funds will be made available to bring the Cradle vision to life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very exciting, too, are the moves by the state government to remove uncertainty around the process to enable developers who wish to lodge development applications to build a cable car up Mount Wellington. This is an exciting development in our capital. I am certain those who know the mountain will see the merit in such a project. It has worked well in other countries, and indeed one only has to look at the Kuranda Skyrail in Cairns to see what such a new product can do for visitor demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the amazing and revolutionary policy adopted by the Tasmanian government in allowing sensitive, sustainable and appropriate tourism developments in our national parks and reserves is to be commended. We have some of the most spectacular reserves in the world, and it is time to open them up to allow not just the uber-fit, but everyone, to see them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I end on this note: we have the best environment, the best forests, the best beaches, the best rivers, the best restaurants and chefs, the best food and the best drink—whiskey, wine and beer. We also know how to market ourselves. Tasmania is doing well. Come on down see what the hype is all about. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  On 5 March I received correspondence from a New South Wales constituent, Mr Ian Macpherson, in relation to the tragic death of his son, Tim Macpherson. Tim was needlessly killed in a workplace incident at the Barangaroo Ferry Hub site. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rang Mr Macpherson to offer my condolences to him and his family, and was shocked at the circumstances of his son's death. On Wednesday afternoon 1 March 2017, the transfer of a steel beam by the construction barge Maeve Anne at the Barangaroo Ferry Hub went horribly wrong. An unsecured steel beam was struck by the beam that was being lifted. The unsecured beam came crashing down onto the deck of the barge. For some reason, as yet unknown, at least two workers were on the deck of the barge, under the lift. One of them was a 32-year-old rigger/dogman, Tim Macpherson. Tim was crushed under the beam and was killed immediately. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tim had his whole life ahead of him. He was married to Ashleigh, with a young son, Jack. Ashleigh is pregnant with their second child. Tim and Ashleigh had just purchased their new home in Windella, near Maitland in New South Wales. This is a young hardworking family man struck down in the prime of his life in yet another construction fatality. A lovely young family has been torn apart as a result of a construction industry death that was entirely avoidable. This tragedy should never have happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The main contractor for the Ferry Hub, McConnell Dowell; the barge contractor, Brady Marine &amp; Civil; and the labour-hire agency that employed Tim, Constructive Workforce, all have questions to answer. New South Wales Maritime has questions to answer. The safety regulator, AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, has questions to answer. There are so many questions in relation to this shocking incident that I believe the New South Wales coroner should conduct an inquest under the provisions in section 27. That is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(d)  if it appears to the coroner concerned that the manner and cause of the person’s death have not been sufficiently disclosed …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the many issues and questions that need to be disclosed are the following. Why did McConnell Dowell contract Brady Marine &amp; Civil to carry out work on the ferry hub site when reputable barge operators could provide barges that complied with AMSA regulations? What steps were taken to ensure that the barge <span style="font-style:italic;">Maeve Anne</span> was fit to sail from Brisbane to Sydney? What steps did McConnell Dowell take to ensure that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Maeve Anne</span>, the barge used on the Barangaroo site, was fit for purpose?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why were Brady Marine &amp; Civil allowed to operate from February 2016 to 30 May 2016 with a barge that did not comply with AMSA safety regulations? What inspections were undertaken when the barge arrived from Brisbane and between February 2016 and 30 May 2016? Why did it take almost four months to issue the barge operator with a prohibition notice from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did New South Wales Maritime, operating as the delegate of AMSA, issue a temporary operating exemption on Friday, 8 June 2016? What inspections were undertaken prior to issuing the temporary operating exemption? Why did AMSA issue a specific exemption to Brady Marine for certain requirements in the act on 6 October 2016? What inspections did AMSA carry out in granting this exemption?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What inspections were undertaken by New South Wales Maritime or AMSA prior to the issue of a certificate of survey and operation on 21 October 2016? What steps has AMSA taken to ensure that sufficient resources are in place within AMSA and its delegated agencies to ensure that safety regulations are being complied with? Why did McConnell Dowell deny the Maritime Union of Australia right of entry to the site and the barge under the New South Wales workplace health and safety legislation in November 2016?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AMSA, New South Wales Maritime and these companies should answer these questions now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a meeting with Paul Garrett from the MUA and Brian Parker of the CFMEU, who provided photographs of the barge following the death of Tim Macpherson. Problems identified with the barge included rusted, insecure and non-existent safety handrails; fire extinguishers and pumps that were not correctly stored or secured; the poor condition of lifebuoys, to which you could not get access to get them out, because they were tethered wrongly; obstructed walkways; the general untidiness of the barge deck, with trip hazards; shipping containers that were not properly secured; and the poor general condition of the barge. I have had decades of experience of working in and representing workers in heavy engineering around the country. The conditions of this barge beggar belief, and they are unacceptable in any construction or engineering undertaking in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AMSA should also advise as to what steps were taken to ensure that the nine conditions on which AMSA granted the exemption certificate were complied with. McConnell Dowell and Brady Marine should advise of steps taken to comply with the conditions in the exemption certificate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The death of Tim also raises questions for the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure in New South Wales. The minister should detail what precautionary steps were undertaken by Transport for New South Wales to provide a safe work program at the Barangaroo Ferry Hub when the barge <span style="font-style:italic;">Maeve Anne</span> was issued a prohibition notice and taken offline by Roads and Maritime Services on 30 May 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unions have still been unable to gain details of wages, superannuation payments and workers compensation by the labour hire company who employed Tim. The unions are concerned to ensure that the legal obligations of the labour hire company, Constructive Workforce, have been met. Attempts to gain legitimate information from the company director, a Ms Millie Booth, have been unsuccessful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Booth, part of the Liberal Dominello family and a prominent campaign manager for the Liberal Party in New South Wales, registered Constructive Workforce on 1 July 2014. This was eight weeks prior to her previous company, Solutions People Group Pty Ltd, going into liquidation on 15 September 2014. Questions have to be asked in relation to the legitimate operation of this company and whether it is simply a phoenix company designed to avoid Ms Booth's legal obligations arising from the liquidation of Solutions People Group Pty Ltd. Millie Booth nee Dominello must immediately engage with Tim's union and provide proof that she has met all her legal obligations to Tim and any other labour hire worker she is engaging on this and other sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tim's father advised me that he was extremely grateful for the support of the CFMEU and MUA. He advised that he was concerned at the politicisation of his son's death by the Minister for Employment, Michaelia Cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of Labor, I wish to express our condolences to Ashleigh, Jack, Kay, Ian and Christina, a family who will never be the same again, a family who have had a tragic loss that was entirely avoidable. There are too many construction deaths in this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207807" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BURSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I was hardly surprised in the Western Australian election to cross paths with preference whisperer Glenn Druery, on the hustings as always at election time with his business plan for getting representatives elected to parliament. Mr Druery claims to have directly or indirectly orchestrated the election of about 15 MPs since 1999. In the 44th Australian parliament, for example, Mr Druery says that seven of the eight crossbench senators, excluding the Greens, were elected as a consequence of his preference deals. Only Senator Xenophon on the crossbench escaped the Druery magic of 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the Western Australian election, however, what did surprise me were reports on the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> and on the inside page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that Mr Druery had campaigned against One Nation for two decades. Mr Druery was quoted as saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One Nation failed in everything they tried to do …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that were not provocative enough, Mr Druery tweeted that Pauline Hanson's One Nation was 'virtually irrelevant', following the Western Australian election. In the real world, One Nation secured 8.4 per cent of the vote in those lower house seats it contested and 8.1 per cent of the vote in the upper house. These figures are entirely consistent with the polls and will result in One Nation securing two and perhaps three upper house seats. Before the election, Mr Druery boasted that he could get six or seven One Nation candidates elected using the preferences he had organised from other minor parties. His business plan is the conjurer's trick of setting up one deal to distract attention from the real deal happening elsewhere. You need to follow the magician's hands if you do business with the Preference Whisperer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have known Mr Druery since the 1999 'tablecloth' election in New South Wales, and his bullying of minor parties is legendary. Threats, intimidation and deception are the currencies of Mr Druery's preference dealings, in my experience. Just last year, in the lead-up to the 2016 federal election, Mr Druery rang the One Nation office in Brisbane and said he 'would tear out Pauline Hanson's throat' if she failed to comply with his instructions on preference deals. One Nation recorded Mr Druery's call. At the 2013 election, Mr Druery left a threatening message on Dr Patricia Petersen's telephone-answering machine, causing her to apply for an apprehended violence order against him. Dr Petersen informed me that she spent $28,000 on the election and lost all prospects of getting elected when Mr Druery dudded her Australian Independents party on a preference deal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same Mr Druery who tells <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that for two decades he has campaigned against One Nation. What Mr Druery really means is that 18 years ago, in 1999, when he manipulated the voting system in New South Wales by setting up no fewer than 15 front parties, he would not negotiate with One Nation because we were expected to receive a large primary vote. In fact, the third candidate elected to the legislative council in 1999 was a One Nation candidate. Ever since then, Mr Druery has been trying to weave his magic with One Nation and bully us into appearing on stage with the other victims of his preferencing charade. He spent years trying to ingratiate himself with One Nation with one hand while he slapped us down with the other. The same thing happened in the recent Western Australia election. One minute Mr Druery wanted to organise a preference deal with One Nation, and the next he would denigrate us, saying, 'One Nation is not to be trusted on preferences.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Druery is duplicitous in his preference deals, and his business plan is seriously flawed. Back in 1999, Mr Druery's business plan included setting up front parties with misleading names to deceive electors to vote for parties that appeared to represent their political convictions but in fact stood for something quite different. Election analyst Antony Green identified Mr Druery as the person responsible for setting up the Gay and Lesbian Party, which was formed by heterosexual activists campaigning for four-wheel-drive access to national parks. Mr Green also observed that Mr Druery and his friends set up the Marine Environment Conservation Party, another four-wheel-drive group more interested in bush-bashing than conserving marine life. In that election, the Preference Whisperer famously shot himself in the foot when one of his front parties, Marijuana Smokers Rights, received more votes than expected, knocking out Mr Druery and electing his mate Malcolm Jones, of the Outdoor Recreation Party, to the Legislative Council. What a disaster that turned out to be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Malcolm Jones as a member of the Legislative Council continued doing what he and Mr Druery had done in the 1999 election—namely, working as conjurers for front parties. Unwisely, Mr Jones used the parliament's resources to sign up people to various front parties, identified by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption as including the Reconciliation Party, the Environment Party, the Four Wheel Drive Party, the Workers Party, the Anglers Party, the Stop the Greenies Party, the Marijuana Freedom Party, the Country Party, the Free Education Party, the Gun Owners Party and the Horse Riders Party. The writing was on the wall for Mr Jones after he was found by the ICAC to have acted corruptly, and he resigned from the Legislative Council rather than suffer the shame of being voted out of the chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Druery modified his business plan and stopped setting up front parties, but he continued to ply his preference magician's trade by manipulating the group voting ticket to deceive voters and enhance the prospects for election of his many and varied clients from all sides of politics. His actions might not have been illegal or even corrupt, but they were morally and politically bankrupt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At various times, Mr Druery stood as the candidate for the Liberals for Forests Party and the Liberal Democrats Party, but so far his business plan has failed to work when he is the candidate—a good outcome in my opinion, since Mr Druery's business plan is not just 'magical'; it amounts to a pyramid scheme that defrauds investors. Preference-harvesting Druery-style is a rort. He famously organised hundreds of thousands of preferences from minor parties that resulted in Ricky Muir from Victoria getting elected to the Senate from a record-low base of 17,122 primary votes. Nobody would dispute that Mr Muir turned out to be a good senator, but the word 'rort' is an appropriate description of his election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Druery said his clients represent seven per cent of the upper house vote in the Western Australian election. I have no idea who his clients were or how much they paid him, but the chances of them all getting a seat were Buckley's and none. The so-called Druery grouping is a classic pyramid scheme developed by Mr Druery for the group voting ticket still used in some of the country's upper-house chambers. I did hear a report on ABC Radio that he was offering his political consulting services for $50,000 per candidate elected on a no win, no fee basis. Perhaps the business plan has changed. Mr Druery denied the ABC report, but he had made a similar offer to One Nation in return for the six or seven seats he said he could organise in Western Australia. Goodness knows how he was going to get seats for all his customers in the west as well as for One Nation. I am reminded of the bloke who always picks the winner of the Melbourne Cup by having a few bob on every horse in the race.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper report I mentioned earlier says Mr Druery works in a minor party senator's office and at the same time advises candidates of other minor parties how to get elected to parliament. I might be old-fashioned, but it looks like a conflict of interest to me and suspiciously like the same conduct that the ICAC labelled as corrupt in the case of Malcolm Jones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The newspaper report also says that Mr Druery travelled to Western Australia 'on his own time and money'. I will not believe it until I see copies of his travel claims. Mr Druery is also accused of using his Senate name card to lobby for private business. Another issue is that Mr Druery's bullying is not limited to his preference dealings; I am reliably informed that some of his work colleagues are on stress leave on account of his behaviour in the office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Druery will say that this has been an unfair attack on his character and his reputation and a misuse of parliamentary privilege. I reject that proposition on the basis that there is really nowhere to go with allegations of this kind in the absence of a federal independent commission against corruption or a federal parliamentary commissioner of standards. People need to be properly accountable for the way parliament's resources and allowances are used, and Mr Druery is no exception.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  One of the privileges of public life is the interaction that one has with the community. That was brought home to me one week ago when I was given the singular honour of being able to open the Car Yard Cafe. The Car Yard Cafe is a facility operated by Aurora Disability Services. When I opened that cafe on 15 March this year, they were celebrating their 29th birthday, having been operational as a volunteer committee, with some paid staff, assisting the disability community by stressing their abilities and harnessing their abilities. Founded by the inspirational Joy Cairns and her husband Graham, Aurora Disability Services has provided assistance to countless numbers of families for nearly three decades now. They have facilities at Mill Lane in Glenorchy in the northern suburbs of Hobart. They also have The Old Chapel Tea Rooms in Glenorchy, and now their newest facility is the Car Yard Cafe in Derwent Park, which is very close by to Glenorchy—the next suburb south.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What made this opening so special for me was that it was a genuine celebration of community at its very best. The whole cafe was set up and is operated without a single cent of taxpayer money. It was all done on a volunteer and also a business model. The landlord assisted with a rental arrangement. A legal firm assisted with legal work. People made all sorts of donations and contributions to ensure that this facility could get up and running, and it would be fair to say none more so than the founders of Aurora Disability Services, Joy and Graham Cairns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, as a nation, should be celebrating facilities such as the Car Yard Cafe where the community comes together and works together to deliver for the less fortunate within our community, in this case the disability sector, and where the community rallies together and ensures that facilities can be provided without the support of taxpayer funding. I believe that that is a model that other communities around Australia should look at, celebrate, emulate and copy. There is so much a community can do if the community is appropriately motivated to do something for themselves and to assist each other. Too often there are people within the community that will say, 'Wouldn't that be a good idea,' and then come to government seeking taxpayer assistance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall, prior to my entry to this place, having the privilege of being involved with the establishment of, firstly, Jireh House women's shelter, which is still going, and, secondly, Yastas, which is short for Youth Accommodation Services Tasmania. They are two facilities that were established by community people simply getting together and setting up the show without the need of any taxpayer funding. I recall at Jireh House, the women's shelter, we were somewhat naive. We did not realise that federal government funding was available until after a few years of operation. The ladies that ran the show then approached them, and Commonwealth departmental officials could not believe what had been happening without taxpayer funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community does have a responsibility to provide, when it can, these sorts of facilities. So, when I was opening the Car Yard Cafe, pretty much at this time exactly one week ago, I could not help but remember that which I had been involved in. I was so excited to see the car yard owner providing rental assistance and a legal firm providing legal service and a cafe company providing free coffees for the opening. I am also reminded of the fact that milk, bread and other requirements for both the Car Yard Cafe and The Old Chapel Tea Rooms are provided by a generous supporter and donor. I think this is a model that needs to be emulated and supported. Having said that, of course, these facilities always need people who are drivers within their community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated earlier, Joy Cairns in particular, ably assisted by her husband Graham, has been running Aurora Disability Services now for some 29 years. What should be noted is that, prior to establishing Aurora Disability Services, Joy Cairns was involved in another disability service provider, so she has a very long history. Her efforts in this area were awarded with an OAM some years ago. Clearly she is deserving of that for the work she has done within the disability sector. Joy Cairns, her volunteers and those who are employed there are committed to ensuring that the first three letters of the word disability are, in effect, written in lowercase, and the word ABILITY is written in uppercase. That is what they seek to do: concentrate on the ability of the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I invite any Tasmanian, or, indeed, any of my colleagues that might be visiting Tasmania, to pop into either The Old Chapel Tea Rooms or the Car Yard Cafe, and experience the wonderful, warm atmosphere, and be served by people who have a disability but are harnessing their abilities. They are very good and capable of providing you with a wonderful bowl of soup, toasted sandwiches, a cup of coffee or whatever might be your requirement. These are people who enjoy the opportunity of employment. These are people who really do see the benefit of working within a proper structure. They are trainees, and they are being ably assisted by the volunteers and the employees of Aurora Disability Services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to place on record that I considered it a great honour to be allowed to open the Car Yard Cafe and promote the concept of community getting involved in self-help, and also the community considering where and how they might be able to assist those that are disabled amongst us—and, might I also add, the mums and dads who dedicate their lives to those who are disabled—with these services. They not only provide employment and training opportunities for the disabled in our community, but, in providing them with that opportunity, they also provide the mums and dads of these people the opportunity to be able to do other things while their children are at work, undertaking the servicing of the customers in these facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish the Car Yard Cafe every success, and I encourage my fellow Tasmanians, whenever possible, to partake of the service and the beverages that they provide to ensure that they maintain viability. Aurora Disability Services has been around now for 29 years. I hope and pray that they will be around for many more years to come.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I have previously advised the Senate of the fact that my Senate office will shortly be opening on the Gold Coast, which will be the first time in about 20 years that the Gold Coast, which is Queensland's second biggest city, will have a senator based there. That will be a good development for the Gold Coast, to have more diverse representation than it has been used to in recent years. It was in that context that last week I was pleased to visit the Gold Coast Community Legal Centre in Southport with my good friend the shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus. We went along to the Gold Coast Community Legal Centre, both to see what kind of work they are doing with Gold Coast residents and also to highlight some terrible cuts which that CLC and many others right across Australia face in the coming weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gold Coast Community Legal Centre, like many others around the country, does really important work for very vulnerable people. It covers areas such as tenancy law, employment law and consumer disputes along with minor criminal matters. Community legal centres such as the one at Southport perform an absolutely vital role in providing access to justice for people who could otherwise not afford to take legal action themselves and hire lawyers at their own expense. Some of the most important work that the Gold Coast Community Legal Centre does is in the area of domestic and family violence. Unfortunately, this is a scourge that we are seeing around Australia, and it is pleasing that so many people have spoken up against domestic and family violence in recent times. This community legal centre does really vital work in that space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, for reasons we do not quite understand, domestic and family violence is a very big problem on the Gold Coast. In fact, it has been the scene of some well-publicised tragic murders of women by their former partners over the last year or two. Probably many members of this chamber, no matter where they live, have been disturbed by those reports that we have seen in recent times. In that context, it is not surprising that the number of domestic and family violence cases that are handled by the Gold Coast Community Legal Centre has risen fourteenfold in just the last four years. There has been a fourteenfold increase in the number of domestic and family violence cases handled by the Gold Coast Community Legal Centre in just four years. In raw numbers, that means that four years ago the community legal centre was handling about 60 domestic and family violence cases, and that number has spiralled to the 890 that it currently has on its books. Put another way: about three years ago, one-in-12 calls that the Gold Coast Community Legal Centre received for its services related to domestic and family violence; that has now increased to one-in-three calls being about this terrible crime that is committed against so many women and children across our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no exaggeration to say that the work of the Gold Coast Community Legal Centre, in providing legal advice to victims of domestic and family violence, is literally saving lives. The work that they perform includes providing duty lawyer services, and it is particularly important in the Gold Coast because it is the site of the only Domestic and Family Violence Specialist Court in Queensland. The service also provides nine outreach clinics across the Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that incredibly important work is now at risk from funding cuts that this Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, is introducing from 1 July this year. Funding to community legal centres right across the country, including on the Gold Coast, will be cut by 30 per cent from 1 July this year, which is only a couple of months away. That is going to have dramatic consequences for community legal centres across Australia. On the Gold Coast, that is going to have particularly dire consequences. As a result of the funding increases that federal Labor provided last time we were in office, the Gold Coast was able to increase domestic violence services. This community legal centre now risks losing both of its specialist domestic violence lawyers. This means that the cuts that Senator Brandis is overseeing will literally put the lives of women and children in danger because they will no longer be able to get the legal assistance that they need to protect themselves from current or former partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, the government must stop these cuts. It is deeply unfortunate that not one of the Gold Coast LNP federal members—all four federal members from the Gold Coast are LNP—has spoken up against these cuts being imposed, despite the horrific number of incidents of domestic and family violence that we are seeing on the Gold Coast. I have today written to Senator Brandis asking him to reverse these cuts—</span>

In addition to at least 16 occasions on which the Prime Minister ruled out his government amending laws preventing hate speech, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief of staff, Peta Credlin, said yesterday: 'The most vociferous person in the coalition against changes to 18C was Malcolm Turnbull.' Minister, when did the Prime Minister decide to stop being a pest to those seeking to amend section 18C and instead join them?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Dastyari, I did not see Ms Credlin's comments, but I will take at face value what you say. First of all, on no occasion—not 16 occasions, not one occasion—did Prime Minister Abbott or Prime Minister Turnbull say that the question of reform of section 18C would never be revisited. That was never ever said. They said, at various times, that the issue had been taken off the table. I remember Mr Abbott saying that—and that was the case. I remember Mr Turnbull saying during the election campaign last year that it was not a big priority for the government—and that was the case too. Nevertheless, the suggestion that there was ever a commitment that the matter would never be revisited is false.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Mr Turnbull, I know what his views on this matter are, and they have never changed. The fact is that Mr Turnbull has an admirable and lifelong commitment to the protection of freedom of speech. It was Mr Turnbull who as a young man acted for the British former intelligence officer Peter Wright in successfully taking proceedings against the United Kingdom government, which was seeking to prevent the publication by Mr Peter Wright—</span>

That is why we have introduced a new standard of harassment, which was meant to be in the legislation introduced many years ago by former Attorney-General Lavarch but was for some unexplained reason omitted. Senator Dastyari, the question you have to answer is this: what is the conduct that you would prohibit that would not be prohibited by the government's new test? What is the conduct that you would prohibit that would not be prohibited by a prohibition on intimidation or harassment? If you look at the racial anti-vilification statutes of every like-minded country in the world, the two key concepts are harassment and intimidation. In this case, harassment, for the first time, will be outlawed by the Turnbull government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am very pleased that earlier today the House of Representatives passed the Turnbull government's legislation to bring in place more affordable, more accessible and fairer child-care support for Australian families. These are reforms that I am pleased will come to the Senate once the Senate has concluded debating the savings measures required to fund our $1.6 billion increased investment into support for Australian child-care services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our reforms will benefit around one million Australian families. They will deliver assistance that will ensure that low-income families are able to access higher levels of child-care subsidy to help them to work, study and volunteer. They will ensure that the lowest income families are able to access child-care services at around $15 a day. Families currently face the $7,500 cliff in child-care rebate support. Our reforms will abolish it for all low- and middle-income families. These are tangible, practical reforms that will help them to choose to work more hours. Evidence demonstrates that more than 200,000 families may well choose to work more hours or work more days, to participate more in the Australian workforce, because they will no longer have child-care fees as an impediment or barrier to their participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are critical reforms. They also contain an hourly rate cap. We will put in place a mechanism to keep a lid on fee growth in the child-care sector. This is an important mechanism that ensures that neither families nor taxpayers continue to bear the brunt of excessive fee increases but instead enjoy a more affordable, more available, more productive child-care regime in the future.</span>

Take a single parent working for about $50,000 per annum. That single parent with two children under six in long day care for three days a week will be around $3,300 a year better off. That is $3,300 that will help that parent to work the hours that suit them and to be able to meet the costs of child care to participate in the workforce. Equally, a family in which both parents work and earn around $80,000 with two children in long day care will be around $3,400 better off as a result of the reforms the Turnbull government is implementing. These are real benefits that will make a real difference to making it easier for hardworking Australian households.</span>

Around one million Australian families deserve it and need it. They are suffering under a broken child-care model. When Labor were in government they only ever tinkered with that child-care model. At the last election Labor promised to continue with it, but the Turnbull government is determined to completely reform and overhaul it.</span>

That is why, by the way, some 20 years or so ago the High Court acknowledged an implied constitutional freedom of political communication for the very reason, as the High Court acknowledged in a series of decisions, that it is necessarily implicit in the nature of Australia as a parliamentary democracy that there should actually be a constitutionally recognised protection of freedom of speech. Do you dispute that, Senator Kitching? Of course our society is based on freedom of speech, but it is based on other values as well, including tolerance, including mutual respect and including, as the government is seeking to do, strong and robust antivilification laws. </span>

                  </a>  The ABC last week uncovered that the company structure of Adani means that at least $3 billion in royalty rights and even more in assets can be diverted to tax havens owned by the billionaire Adani family. So, even if the project goes bust, Adani could sell it to someone else, and yet royalties would still be paid into the Adani family's Cayman Islands account. Does the minister agree with the assessment of financial analyst Adam Walters that this is a structure that guarantees the Adani family will be enriched while others are impoverished? </span>

I just want to take issue first with your description of it being 'climate destroying' and 'job killing'. Clearly, the coalmine will generate thousands of jobs in North Queensland. I do not know the last time, Mr President, that Senator Di Natale visited North Queensland, but if he had visited in the past year he would have heard from local businesses, he would have heard from tourism businesses as well, their need to have more jobs, more opportunity and more business in their communities, and he would have heard the overwhelming support for this coalmine in North Queensland.

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. I was going on to also dispute Senator Di Natale's opinion that this project would be climate destroying. We are lucky in this country and should be proud that we have some of the highest quality coals in the world. The rest of the world will be using coal-fired power for many, many years to come. The more energy intensive, the higher quality the coal that they use and the fewer emissions there will be. So it is a good thing for the world if we, as a country, can develop our coal industry and replace the coals that are used from other countries, which are much lower quality—and it is widely accepted that the coal in India, in particular, is of lower quality than the coal that Adani will mine here in Queensland. So that is a good thing for the environment. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think the Senate should know that Adani are not new to Australia. They are a company that have operated here now for six years. They have operated the Abbot Point Coal Terminal, just near Bowen, in Queensland. If the allegations and suspicions that Senator Di Natale is making are true, it would be apparent in their corporate behaviour over the six years, you would think. I am not aware of any allegations for investigation into that matter. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government has made a number of changes to strengthen that corporate tax regime to make sure the companies in this country do pay their fair share of tax, and I certainly expect and will do everything I can as the minister to ensure that companies that make profits in this country pay their fair share of taxes. </span>

They have operated a large coal terminal in Queensland for six years. Again, if there have been allegations or if Senator Di Natale has allegations of Adani not paying their fair share of corporate tax, I would be interested to hear them and the government would of course be looking to follow those up with the Australian Taxation Office. But, to my knowledge, there have not been such allegations. I expect all companies in this country to pay their fair share of tax. Adani are no different than any other company.</span>

They do make a lot of wealth for our country and they do pay a significant share of their profits in tax revenue to this nation. It helps fund important things across our country. That is why as a government we support further investment in our mining sector that can help grow that sector, grow our economy, create jobs and provide even more tax revenue to the Commonwealth government and state governments so that we can fund important public services in this country. I am confident this project will provide those benefits in taxes, jobs and other services. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Indeed, in the 2016 white paper the Turnbull government committed to creating a more capable, agile and potent Australian Defence Force, and that is exactly what we are doing. It has been an historic few weeks for the Royal Australian Air Force in that context.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to advise that the first of Australia's EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft have now entered service after making their debut at the Avalon Airshow recently. The Growlers, which give Australia a dedicated electronic attack capability for the first time, made their debut at the end of last month. Through their jamming ports the Growlers can disrupt military electronic systems such as radars to protect our personnel and particularly to improve our situational awareness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at RAAF Base Amberley two weeks ago, where the government is investing more than $350 million to upgrade facilities to support this very important new capability. I spoke to crew, maintainers and base leadership about the new planes. They are very excited by the prospect that by the middle of the year all 12 Growlers will be based at Amberley as part of No. 6 Squadron, significantly enhancing Australia's air power when it achieves initial operational capability next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, our first two F-35A Joint Strike Fighters also made their Australian debut at Avalon. This is a very important milestone for the Australian Joint Strike Fighter, and gave those who attended the air show a view of Australia's future combat aircraft and two very impressive pilots the opportunity to pilot them from the US to Australia for the show. When Australia's F-35As enter service in 2020 it will mark a significant step forward in our air combat capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, the F-35A and the Growler represent a potent and technologically advanced air combat and strike capability that is essential to our ability to defend Australia and to support our national interests.</span>

It relates to the announcement made on Monday that there would be a third round of consultation with the Kimba community in South Australia on the location of a national radioactive waste facility in the Kimba area, including a postal ballot. In embarking on this consultation the government was advising that it was seeking 'broad community consent' for participating in the process of site selection. It also went on to say, 'The Federal Government has said it won't impose the facility on an unwilling community'. Two consultations have occurred, both last year, in early and late 2016. The first saw 51 in favour and 49 against. The second consultation resulted in another split result, with 56 per cent in favour and 44 per cent against. What does 'broad community consent' mean to the government? What percentage does the government say constitutes 'broad community consent'?</span>

The second round of figures—56 to 44 per cent—were as a result of some early consultations my department did in Kimba with a narrow range of the community. We are not using those figures as a reliable estimate of community support; they were never intended to be used in that way. It was to try and make an assessment as to whether this nomination should be taken forward any further. I must clarify to the Kimba community and to others that we are not using those figures as a basis for further decisions because they were not a full and comprehensive assessment of support in Kimba. The earlier figure that Senator Xenophon mentioned was from a consultation period concluded early last year, and he is correct that the results were 51 to 49. We did not take that nomination forward. Even though it had majority support, we did not view that as being broad community support so it was not further. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had taken forward a proposal from the Hawker region—Senator Xenophon might be aware of that—where support was at 65 per cent. We have not put a definitive figure on broader community support, for the reason that it is not just about the overall figure; we would need a figure in the range of the support we received in Hawker. There are other considerations to factor in, depending on the local circumstances, including the neighbouring landholders and their support, which is of great importance to me and my department in making the assessment—as are the views of any traditional owners who might be present or might have rights on land that has been brought forward through this voluntary process. For the two nomination that I have accepted this week, the department's assessment is that there is greater support from neighbouring landholders. We are aware of only one landholder who is opposed to these two nominations coming forward from the direct neighbours. I will go further in the next answer— (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>)</span>

I will take that on notice. Senator Xenophon might be aware that it has been part of an overall consultation process, where a number of sites have been assessed at different times. We will do what we can to split out those costs for the Kimba region. I am certainly aware of the different views in Kimba. On this issue, I have met with Working for Kimba's Future, which is a group supportive of the proposal, and also with the group No Radioactive Waste on Agricultural Land in Kimba or SA. I have met with both those groups. I understand that. However, our assessment was that given the early assessments by the department and the support from neighbouring landholders and also from the local council to proceed with this process—not necessarily the nominations themselves but the vote—it was important in my decision to accept those proposals now and further test community support.</span>

Wallerberdina Station, near Hawker in South Australia, has been accepted. It is in a further phase of assessment than the nominations we received in Kimba. We are open to taking further applications and nominations from other areas around the country, including on Crown land, but at this stage these are the nominations that we have accepted.

I think it is very important for our nation to do this. One in two Australians will benefit from the use of nuclear medicines in their lifetime, and a lot of radioactive waste relates to those products. We currently store radioactive waste on more that 100 sites in this country, so finding a centralised home is necessary and important to the objectives of this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It will create thousands of jobs in North Queensland, and we are all about trying to support projects that create jobs for hardworking Australians in this country. I want my children to have opportunities in the region. The people that I live near in North Queensland want their children to have opportunities in the region. They want them to have a future and not have to travel hundreds of kilometres away to find jobs and opportunities. They would like them to have a future in their region, and projects like the Adani Carmichael mine can help achieve that.</span>

We have heard reports that the mine is likely to go ahead. Mr Adani himself has been reported as saying that the mine will definitely proceed. There are further decisions to be made by the Adani group, but it will be a good news day for this country when this mine can proceed. It will be the first new coal based open mine in this country for more than 40 years. In my part of the world, opportunities were created by the opening of the Bowen and Surat basins. In other parts of our country, mines have been built and developed in the Hunter Valley. When we open up a new mining resource area it is not just about the individual project that starts it; it is about all the other projects and services that come in behind it. So while this project can create thousands of jobs in and of itself, when we open up a new basin other mines might open in the area. Other services will come to North Queensland and create a vibrant and thriving industry.</span>

                  </a>  These mayors represent hundreds of thousands of North Queenslanders, and they are fully behind and support this project, and I think their voices deserve to be heard. Senator Macdonald is absolutely right: these mayors are from different political persuasions. They come from different political parties. They do not always share my views on every issue, but we are all one and united in North Queensland in our support for this project. Graham Scott, the Chairman of Capricorn Enterprises, said: 'I just wish out-of-town activists would get their facts straight on Adani. If they did, they would understand why there is so much community support in Central Queensland for it to go ahead.' Vanessa Rauluni from Coal Train said: 'This project will create thousands of jobs for Central Queensland. It saddens me to see uninformed people from outside Central Queensland making moral judgements about our community.' Please, I ask those commenting on Adani to listen to the people that live there first. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I will take the interjection from Senator McKenzie, because we have seen a different point of view today in the Senate chamber from a group that do not respect views that are opposed to their own. They preach diversity and they preach that they are not prejudiced, but we just saw the most prejudiced, ill-informed bile from the leader of the Greens party today. When it comes to a company from another country, because it is doing a project he does not like, he jumps to conclusions. He has no evidence at all to bring to the debate, but he is acting in the most prejudiced and non-diverse way possible for a senator. What I would ask of those that oppose this mine is to please listen to the people of North Queensland. Please listen to the people that might have a different view to you, have an open mind, engage in the discussion and realise that we can have a strong economy and protect the environment as well. We can have thousands of jobs and protect our Great Barrier Reef as well.</span>

The government has made a regulation that denies category A patients access to marijuana via the Special Access Scheme. This scheme allows for medicines that are not on a register to be supplied to patients who are seriously ill and reasonably likely to die within a matter of months, or where premature death is likely in the absence of early treatment. So, rather than expedite the availability of medicinal marijuana as a matter of life and death, the government has made a regulation that lets people suffer and die while the regulation process and category B processes meander on. Minister, isn't this playing with people's lives?</span>

The changes that the coalition government made last year were in response to concerns out in the community around access to medicinal cannabis. I think they have been very positive changes, and they certainly have been well received. What the government has done is provide the missing piece to the puzzle, if you like, in ensuring that we have a domestic supply of medicinal cannabis, and that was what was missing prior to the changes that were brought in last year. Previously that lack of availability of therapeutically approved medicinal cannabis had been a real barrier to people who were accessing treatment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the senator, the health minister's office advises that the medicines that are traditionally used in the Special Access Scheme category A are unregistered products that are generally unregistered overseas, have been subjected to a full safety, quality and efficacy assessment, and come with product information that allows the medical practitioner to assess the risk of any adverse effects and manage drug interactions and dose response matters. They are not available for unregistered medicinal cannabis products. So it is then appropriate, and people would expect, that there be some form of clinical oversight from the general practitioners when choosing to use unregistered medicinal cannabis products. Under Special Access Scheme category B, under which these products are approved, where the doctor can justify their clinical decision to prescribe that medicinal cannabis product, I am advised that approval can be given in as little as two days. So, even under the current requirements, there can be a very quick approval process from the TGA so people are able to access those products.</span>

It is actually consistent with the pathways that were available prior to that legislation, when cannabis was a schedule 9 product. So it is not actually more restrictive; it is actually consistent with the previously existing pathways, and that was our policy—that the product be available under the pathways that were in place at the time. There is no new prohibition. The changes to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations were necessary to maintain the agreed level of regulation and oversight, as per the government's announcement.</span>

We know that in relation to the poppy industry—which of course we have; my good colleagues in Tasmania know well about that—there are already existing stringent requirements when it comes to licensing. So it is not an unusual disclosure requirement; it does already apply to the poppy industry, as I have indicated.</span>

The requirement is different, as I understand it, for employees, which is not as stringent, but I think people across Australia, when we are dealing with a product such as marijuana and looking at the licensing arrangements for the growing of that product, people would absolutely expect a 'fit and proper person' test.</span>

                  </a>  Three in Brisbane and one on the Gold Coast, so it a little bit interesting when they come in to ask us questions about the impact on regional communities. None of them even live there! I wonder how many on our side come from regional communities. I think we should actually put our hand up on this side if we are from a regional community. For those opposite, I bet there is barely a hand up—perhaps Senator Dodson might put his hand up, but nobody else over there comes from a regional community. I find it extraordinary that they can feign this surprise for regional Queensland when they live in Brisbane, Brisbane, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. It is those on this side of the chamber who are going to ensure that those living in regional communities have a strong future. Indeed, only last week the coalition put in place the regional ministerial task force to look across government, cross-portfolio, at how we can best invest in regional communities. It is not those on the other side but those on this side of the chamber, in the coalition, who are the ones who are going to deliver for regional people.</span>

I tell you what we are not going to do: we are not going to impose a carbon tax on regional people that is going to decimate them, which we saw under the previous Labor government.

Those opposite can barely get out of their city cafes in their coloured socks to go out and see regional communities, when those on this side are working hard to deliver. We hear nothing from the other side, nothing from the Labor Party, about the future of regional Queensland. They come in here and they carp and they go on, but they do not care—they are not out there. They live in Brisbane and they live in the Gold Coast. On this side of the chamber, we live with those people. We understand those communities. We are the ones who listen to those communities and who are going to continue to deliver—unlike the failed regional policies we have seen in the past from the previous Labor government.</span>

The Turnbull government is committed to countering violent extremism in our region. Our overseas development assistance is a very valuable tool in this regard. Recently we announced a new policy development approach to countering violent extremism, which will act as a very good guide in the delivery of ODA as well as assist us to make better decisions in this area to ensure that the ODA that we deliver is appropriate and targeted at times when it needs to be delivered in sensitive ways. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are currently supporting CVE initiatives in Indonesia, in Pakistan and in the Philippines. Violent extremism in our region creates major problems. It harms our regional security; it undermines our efforts to support economic growth, stability, and poverty reduction; it disproportionately affects developing countries, with serious economic consequences; and it prevents the participation of women in society and in decision-making. Of course, it exacerbates conflict and undermines the ability of those people seeking to deliver humanitarian and development assistance. Australia has also been a strong advocate for changes at the international level so that we can ensure that our overseas development meets the contemporary challenges the world is now facing. We supported the changes in the OECD rules which make non-coercive efforts to counter violent extremism eligible for being counted as overseas development assistance. We have also endorsed UN efforts through a plan of action to prevent violent extremism.</span>

We have increased our support to international mechanisms. For example, we have given $3 million to the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund since 2014 to strengthen resilience against violent extremism; we have contributed to the establishment of a Commonwealth secretariat CVE unit, with the contribution of $2.5 million; and we are promoting new ways of cooperation, including through a global counter-terrorism forum. In this financial year, for example, Australia will provide funding in practical ways in our region, for example, to the Asia Foundation, to conduct research on developing best practice to better guide our aid and our aid spending on CVE in the Asia-Pacific region, and also other small-scale funding to discrete, carefully targeted CVE projects in Asia.</span>

The promotion of stability in our region is at the heart of Australia's overseas development assistance. It is important that violent extremism undermines our basic development goals. It harms economic growth because it means that fewer people can escape poverty in those countries. It prevents women participating fully in society. It destabilises governance efforts, complicating the delivery of services on the ground. It facilitates the illicit movement of drugs, money and arms, thereby weakening security in those countries. It means that development agencies cannot do their work on the ground. And, of course, it contributes to political instability.<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  font-weight:bold;&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span></span>

The coalition is strongly united behind our National Economic Plan for Jobs and Growth. We are strongly united behind the plan that we took to the last election, and that plan of course included our opposition to Labor's disastrous proposals in relation to negative gearing, which would drive up the cost of rental accommodation, drive down the value of established properties around Australia and have a bad effect on investment in our economy. All of these arguments were well articulated in the lead-up to the last election. All of us in the coalition are united behind the policy we took to the last election.</span>

The closest those on the other side have ever come to a business is to proudly close it down, and that is why they do not understand the implications of the Fair Work decision. Those on the other side are happy to support big unions and big business doing deals to trade away Sunday penalty rates, but they will not support a decision of the independent Fair Work Commission that seeks to level the playing field so that small business is able to compete with the big businesses who have cosied up to the unions. So let's pose a few questions, colleagues: is it fair that a family hardware store, mum and dad working hard, must pay more than $5 an hour more than Bunnings to open on a Sunday? Colleagues, is it fair that a family newsagency—we all know one—has to pay $7 more per hour on a Sunday than Officeworks? Is it fair that a family bottle shop must pay, if they can open on a Sunday, $7 more per hour than Dan Murphy's? And the list goes on. What about a boutique clothes shop? If a small business owner, who wants to offer some beautiful clothes, wants to open on a Sunday, they have got to pay $7 more per hour than David Jones. Then of course you have a family book shop, a beautiful old family bookshop—we have all been to them—and they have got to pay, if they can open on a Sunday, $8 more per hour than Target. That is not fair, and that is why we proudly stand up for small business on this side of the chamber. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Well, colleagues, guess what? They were: they were reduced under the former Labor government. Tell me: was there a massive scare campaign at the time by the CFMEU saying, 'We are going to take down that Labor government. What an absolute disgrace! They have reduced the penalty rates for some of the lowest-paid workers in the country.' No, there was not, colleagues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That would indicate to me that the current campaign that is being run by Labor and the unions is nothing more and nothing less than a campaign based on political opportunity. Under the former Labor government, for example, when a hotel employee state award in New South Wales was modernised, penalty rates were reduced by 25 per cent. They went from 200 per cent on a Sunday to 175, and we heard nothing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That explanation from Senator Brandis was entirely inadequate. This is a serious matter which I placed a detailed question on notice on 12 January 2017, and this is a matter that I have been pursuing since April of 2016—in fact, since 4 April 2016. It arises from the issue of voting rights on Barrow Island, a big development run by Chevron. What happens on Barrow Island is that workers are required to work a four-week roster and then have a couple of weeks off. So, when it comes to voting, these workers are absolutely disenfranchised, because Chevron to date has refused to take up polling facilities so workers are able vote on site. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, with a four-week working period, it is very difficult for those workers to get to early polling—and, as we know, early polling opens for three weeks before an election. So, if you have four-week cycle that does not coincide with that three-week period, you cannot avail yourself of that opportunity to do early polling. Secondly, it is almost impossible to get a postal vote because, by the time you received it on Barrow Island and got it back, you would be well out of time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office was contacted by workers on Barrow Island—this is a matter they had tried to pursue themselves—who asked us to seek an explanation as to why they could not have polling facilities on Barrow Island. Barrow Island, at that point, was employing thousands and thousands of workers from all across the country who were not able to exercise their right to vote. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is somewhat ironic, for a government that goes on and on about rights, particularly in relation to being able to offend people under 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, that this matter has fallen on deaf ears. We not only put questions on notice to the government about what was happening on Barrow Island and to seek a reasonable explanation of why workers were not able to get a polling place on the island; I also asked questions of the Australian Electoral Commission at Senate estimates. Quite frankly, their answers were equally unimpressive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had a number of answers from the government, all of which have been evasive. We have so far dealt with Senator Ryan, Senator Cormann and, most recently, with Senator Brandis. But not only have the answers to questions been evasive; they have nearly always been uniformly late. So, for Senator Brandis to try and pull a stunt in here today to say that my office had not given him adequate time, when they have had since 4 April 2016 to answer this question—and most recently since 12 January—is a joke. Quite frankly, it is insulting to the thousands of workers on Barrow Island, who continue to be disenfranchised because we cannot get a polling place up there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To add insult to injury, we were told by the Australian Electoral Commission—and we have also sought answers from Chevron in relation to this matter—that the quarantine requirements of Barrow Island ruled out putting—wait for it—a cardboard box on the island. We took that back to the workforce, and they told us there were other ways around that. </span>

                  </a>  Yes, the quarantine laws that are in place are absolutely appropriate because it was pristine wilderness and it remains free of pests. We want to keep it that way, so, yes, of course, we have to have very strict quarantine laws in place. But I, along with some of my Labor colleagues, visited Barrow Island at the invitation of Chevron, and I was required as a matter of law to undertake an online safety test before I was allowed on the island. We also went through the normal quarantine procedures when we boarded the plane. But I was told very clearly that I could not go on to Barrow Island until I had done this online safety test, so I did it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now you might ask: what has that got to do with anything? Well, sometime later the Prime Minister and an unknown number of people in his party visited Barrow Island. So, given that we have been told that we cannot get a ballot box on Barrow Island because of the quarantine regulations, and having been told that I could not visit Barrow Island without doing this online safety test, we went back and asked the Prime Minister: did you do this, because why should anyone be exempt if we are keeping this island in its pristine state and free from pests and so on? Well, it took about three goes to get an answer that the Prime Minister did not actually do the same required safety test as me, which we thought was extraordinary given that the AEC have told us you cannot put a ballot box on Barrow Island because of the quarantine restrictions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was told along with my Labor colleagues that we could not visit Barrow Island without doing the online safety test. But guess what? The Prime Minister goes to Barrow Island, and he does not have to do the safety test. He does not have to do it. So I thought, if you can make an exception for the Prime Minister and the unknown number of people in his party, surely you can make an exception for a cardboard box so workers can cast their ballot papers—and that is the question we went back with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have asked I think twice now: how many people were in the Prime Minister's party? We have not been told that. We now know that he did not do the online safety test even though I was told—and it was put in writing—that I could not attend Barrow Island unless I had done the online safety test, and workers have been told that they cannot have voting rights on Barrow Island because somehow the cardboard voting box would breach safety regulations. Yet the Prime Minister goes, and he does not have to follow any of these regulations. So that is the question that we have on notice that remains unanswered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, for Senator Brandis to attempt to dismiss that question today is outrageous. We have been trying since 4 April to get an answer to this question, and I do not think any reasonable person would think that it was not okay to provide thousands of workers on Barrow Island with the opportunity to vote. That is what they are asking for, and yet we cannot get straight answers. Chevron, a multinational company that is not paying one cent of tax in this country, has simply ignored my requests for information. We have asked them: what is your objection to setting up a polling station on Barrow Island? Workers, when they are there, do 12-hour shifts. When you have workers on a four-week roster and 12-hour shifts, it seems to me that the most obvious answer would be to simply set up a polling station on Barrow Island. Chevron have refused to answer the question. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite us asking the AEC at estimates why we could not set up a polling station on Barrow Island, the best answer we have had to date—and we have had some doozies—is that it is because of these quarantine restrictions, which are so strict they apply to everyone, except the Prime Minister and his unnamed party. We are still waiting for an answer about the number of people in that party. Imagine if 20 people had gone up with the Prime Minister. It is not beyond the pale. Twenty people, none of whom had to do the online safety test that I, along with other Labor members, had to do. That is a big party to land on Barrow Island. But somehow the quarantine restrictions, which are placed on me and the AEC, are lifted for the Prime Minister. I can only conclude that if they are lifted for the Prime Minister then they can be lifted to provide a polling station. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A government that goes on and on about rights are denying workers on Barrow Island the opportunity to have the right to vote. Something as fundamental as the right to vote is being denied to those workers on Barrow Island. Imagine if some of the workers are fined by the AEC for not voting because they could not get to a polling station because of their four-week roster, or they were unable to exercise early voting because of their four-week roster, or the issue of a postal ballot was out of the question because they are on Barrow Island and it takes weeks for the post to get up there. Imagined if they were fined by the AEC for not voting. This is outrageous, and for Senator Brandis to simply dismiss out of hand a question that, at best, has been outstanding since 12 January and at worst outstanding since 4 April is saying to those thousands of workers on Barrow Island, 'Well, actually, we don't really care about your rights.' It was a pretty simple question about why we cannot get beyond the quarantine restrictions on Barrow Island. We seem to be able to lift them for the Prime Minister and his party but cannot get a ballot box up there to enable people to exercise their fundamental right to vote. It is absolute hypocrisy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Senator Brandis to dismiss the question out of hand today is not good enough. I will be making sure that the workforce on Barrow Island are told very clearly that today Senator Brandis simply dismissed out of hand why there is still no explanation or satisfactory answer to my question. It is not going to go away. I have pursued this issue since April 2016 through three senators so far and through the estimates process, and we are still waiting. If Senator Brandis thinks of frustrating me further today by refusing to answer the question, he is wrong. </span>

                  </a>  That is right, Senator Dastyari: he does not know me. I represent voters in Western Australia and I was shocked and outraged to hear that the thousands of workers on Barrow Island were prevented from voting. I do not think it is unreasonable for the Australian Electoral Commission to set up a mobile polling station. We have them in the most obscure places. We have them on Rottnest Island, which is a holiday island off the coast of WA. It is about a 30 minute boat trip and less than 100 people vote there. But guess what? For the state and federal elections we could put a mobile polling station on Rottnest Island when it would be very convenient for people on the island to come back to Fremantle to vote or to get a postal vote or to do early voting. But, no, we have a mobile polling station on Rottnest Island but we cannot put one on Barrow Island, which is thousands and thousands of kilometres away. Workers are required to do a four-week roster there which makes it almost impossible for them to exercise their right to vote, but we cannot put a polling booth there. And worse: despite my very, very best endeavours, the AEC has failed to give me an adequate response to my questions as to why we cannot manage this on Barrow Island. Three senators in this place—Senator Ryan, Senator Cormann and Senator Brandis—have simply refused today to give me a reasonable explanation as to why we cannot achieve a polling place on Barrow Island. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia presents a lot of challenges to voting because there are many remote places, as there are right across northern Australia and indeed parts of southern Australia because of our vast geographical regions. But somehow we still manage to provide voting opportunities for people across this country except if they are on Barrow Island. This is simply not good enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, for Senator Brandis simply to dismiss the matter out of hand and to leave this chamber is quite disgraceful. But it is typical of this government's arrogance that they do not really care about ordinary Australians. We have seen that through the harsh legislation they have put in place, we have seen it through their arrogance, we saw it in Western Australia from the Barnett government before they got completely smashed in the election and we continue to see it here today with the response from Senator Brandis as to why my question on 12 January remains unanswered. Why is it that workers on Barrow Island cannot be given a vote on polling day in the same way that other Australians go along to their polling place, get their names marked off and cast a vote? Maybe it is because they think all of those workers will vote for the Labor Party, but, like any workplace, there will be a diverse range of workers in that place. I would not be surprised if the government thought. 'We won't give them the vote, because they might all be union members and they might all vote Labor.' They are not playing fair, but we can make any explanation we like in the absence of a proper explanation forthcoming from Senator Brandis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 12 January we have been waiting for a simple set of answers to a range of questions. As I said, I am not going away. There are thousands of workers on Barrow Island. They deserve to be respected by the Australian Electoral Commission and by the Turnbull government. To date, they have not been respected by either. We have had numerous explanations from the Australian Electoral Commission, the last being about quarantine standards. If the quarantine standards are so strict, they should apply to everyone, including the Prime Minister. Yet I know from previous questions on notice that those same standards did not apply to the Prime Minister. Come one, come all. If there are strict quarantine procedures in place, they should apply evenly. If they can be lifted for the Prime Minister and his entourage—as I said, it might have been 20 or it might have been 30 people, who knows? That question has not been answered—then they can certainly be lifted to place a ballot box on Barrow Island so that workers get their due entitlement, like every other Australian, and get the opportunity to vote. Who knows when there will be a federal election. This is such a precarious government that there could be a federal election in the next couple of months. I would hope that workers on Barrow Island are given due respect by the Turnbull government and by the Australian Electoral Commission, and are given that opportunity to vote in their workplace.</span>

They do not want them to vote because they fear that they might all vote Labor. But these workers are from across the country, out of all electorates. There are workers from the eastern states—from New South Wales and from Queensland. They are from all over the country; they are not uniquely Western Australian voters and yet every single one of them is denied that opportunity to vote while they are at work because—who knows why?</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen that exceptions can be made, so it is time that the Turnbull government, and particularly Senator Brandis, took this matter seriously. Make no mistake: I will be alerting the workers on Barrow Island to the flippant way that Senator Brandis simply dismissed their request to have that opportunity to have a vote in their workplace because of the shift configurations they work. It is a disgraceful way for the Turnbull government to treat workers. I do not know why I am surprised! That is the way that they treat workers generally—just to dismiss them, whether it is about penalty rates or not allowing them to vote. I should not be so surprised that that is the way these workers have been treated. But make no mistake: I will make sure that the video of Senator Brandis basically saying, 'Oh, I haven't had enough time!' is shown to the workforce on Barrow Island. Believe me, this will not be the end of this matter, because I am determined that those workers get that fair opportunity to vote like every other Australian and not to be disenfranchised because of the very long shift configuration patterns that those workers currently operate. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  It must be broadcast day in the Senate. The Labor Party senator who just spoke must be suffering a bit of relevance deprivation syndrome in that she needs 20 minutes to raise an issue—and to raise it improperly, I might say, and I will come to that very shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say that the speech by the previous Labor speaker is one that we will not forget for a while, because she repeated herself—10 times over, I counted. She kept repeating the same thing. Obviously, she had run out of material; she had to fill in 20 minutes and so she kept repeating the same things over and over again. So we will not forget or misunderstand what she was on about—no matter how untruthful and how mischievous—and how she deliberately chose to misrepresent not only the Attorney-General, as is the wont of the opposition in this place, but also to cast aspersions on the independent authority which runs elections in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, for those who might be following this debate—that is, if they are still awake after that 20 minutes of boring repetition from the previous speaker—can I just explain what the procedure is here? Questions are placed on notice and they are supposed to be answered within a short period of time—four weeks, I think it might be. And if they are not answered in that time it is up to the senators in the chamber to raise that during the day in the Senate and to ask the minister why it is that these questions have not been answered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, because there are a lot of questions on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> and because there are a number of different ministers involved—many of them are not ministers in this chamber, but in the other place—then the office of the minister in the Senate has to get in touch with the other minister and find out why these questions have not been answered. And so the convention, the courtesy, in this chamber is that if you are going to raise this matter and you are serious about wanting an answer, what you do is to advise the Senate minister's office in good time that you are going to raise this. That gives the Senate minister the opportunity of trying to find out why the answer has not been given.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, this is particularly important when it is a question not of a Senate minister but of a minister in the other chamber—as was the case today. In spite of what the previous Labor speaker has said, as Senator Brandis has indicated—and I believe Senator Brandis before I would believe the previous speaker—his office was given just 15 minutes notice. That is, at a quarter to two, his office was advised that this matter would be raised after question time, not giving the minister's office the opportunity of contacting the House of Representatives minister to find out what the reason was. So, clearly, the Labor Party were not interested in an answer; they were simply wanting to waste 20 minutes of time babbling on 10 times over about this particular issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there are a couple of other points that should be raised. Sure, ministers should answer quickly. I might say to the chamber that I am still waiting some four or five years later for questions I put on notice to the previous Labor government. I put some questions on notice to the Labor government five years ago and they were never answered. Clearly, they are never likely to be. But I know that most of the ministers in this chamber are assiduous in their attention to detail, and had they been given some notice then the Senate minister—in this case, Senator Brandis—could have got in touch with the House of Representatives minister to try to get an answer for the previous Labor senator who spoke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the previous Labor senator who spoke were at all genuine on this matter, she would ask the questions of the Australian Electoral Commission—the commission which deals with polling booths. It is not the government that sets up polling booths; it is the Australian Electoral Commission—an independent statutory authority that runs elections in Australia. I have my issues with the AEC, like the previous senator apparently has, but I do not get up and make outlandish statements in this chamber. I go to committee hearings where I can ask the AEC what is happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In case the senator who spoke previously is not aware, there is a Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that after each election conducts an inquiry into the previous election. Things like where polling booths are, why they are not there or why they should be there are asked of the AEC at those committee hearings. There is plenty of time given. The AEC have been back to the joint standing committee about this election on three or four occasions already, and they will be coming back again. I invite the Deputy President to do what I have done and put yourself on that committee as a participating member. You can go along and ask those questions of the AEC and get answers from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest that the AEC did not put a polling booth at Barrow Island because the AEC apparently thought that the people on Barrow Island might vote for one political party or another is simply an outrageous and disgraceful allegation from anyone in this chamber, particularly someone holding a high office. I think the AEC deserves an apology for that outrageous, untruthful allegation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know why there is not a polling booth on Barrow Island. It is the first I have heard of this issue. It certainly has not been raised in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. If the previous speaker really wants to help people on Barrow Island, there are things like postal voting and pre-poll. There are other ways in which people can cast a vote. I would have thought that people working on Barrow Island would have known an election was coming up and would have applied for a postal vote or found out when the pre-poll could have been undertaken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter for the AEC. Perhaps this is a valid issue. But it is clearly not being treated as a serious issue by the Labor Party, which is simply using 20 minutes to have yet another baseless, groundless, misinformed and deliberately misleading attack on the Attorney-General<span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> They continue to try and do it in this chamber. One day they will wake up and see that the Attorney is assiduous in his attention to detail and making sure things are done properly. Had he been given some notice today, as is the normal custom and courteous custom—the custom you follow if you seriously want an answer rather than just making a political point—it would have allowed the Senate minister to contact the minister in the other chamber to get the detail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate has other important business to discuss today, so, unlike the previous speaker repeating herself so many times, I am not going to take the time of the Senate on this particular matter. I simply, again, call for the previous speaker to apologise to the AEC. I suggest to the speaker that if she is serious about this matter in the future she should give appropriate notice so that, if she is genuine about getting an answer, the Senate minister has the opportunity to find the answer. I raise these matters so that anyone who might be listening to this debate understands what it is about and the import of what was said in the last 20 minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is perhaps worth explaining to those listening what the content of those five questions were that I placed on notice back in January. They went to the announcement that was made during the election campaign about City Deals for the cities of Townsville, Launceston and Western Sydney. I specifically asked: Which stakeholders have been involved in the preparation of those City Deals prior to their announcement? What progress is being made on those City Deals? And what resources are available for City Deals. My questions also went to the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of Australian cities report</span> and the decision to no longer produce that document.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pursued this in the most recent estimates hearings, and when asking officials questions I noted that I was asking questions similar to ones I had previously placed on notice. I might be reading too much into this, but the PM&amp;C officials looked a little surprise to be asked this. I wondered—although of course this was not confirmed—whether or not they had in fact prepared answers to these questions and those answers had simply not been provided to me. Indeed, in those last estimates we asked officials when those draft answers had been provided to the Prime Minister's office so that we could get an indication of whether these answers are there and are available to be provided to me but it is simply too embarrassing to do that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say that because all of the signs were that the City Deals announced during the election were policy just made up on the run, policy that was essentially rushed out to fill a gaping hole in the coalition's thinking. This is one of the great gaps between the way this side of the chamber does politics and the way the other side of the chamber does politics. We have a very long tradition, reaching back to Whitlam, of taking cities seriously, of seeing cities as being at the core or our urban fabric and at the core of our society. We understand that the Commonwealth has a role to play in cities. Successive coalition governments have taken completely the opposite approach. They have washed their hands of infrastructure; they have generally considered that these are questions for state governments; and they have been unwilling to accept that in a country like Australia, where the vast majority of our population lives in just a handful of quite large cities, getting cities right is absolutely essential for our economy and for our society. Cities are absolutely places where Commonwealth governments ought to be very active. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course this is not something that the coalition generally takes seriously. Nonetheless, they found themselves with a Prime Minister who had made quite a lot of enthusiastic noise about cities, and doubtless they had to scramble to come up with something to say about it in the heat of an election so they would not be embarrassed. What did they do? In the last weeks of the election, Malcolm Turnbull and the assistant minister, Angus Taylor, announced three so-called City Deals: one in Townsville, one in Launceston and one in Western Sydney. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should say that City Deals are a concept pioneered in the United Kingdom. They are a very good idea. And they have a lot to offer Australia. What they propose is a deep collaboration and a very targeted, place-based, specific collaboration between, in the case of the UK, two tiers of government—in Australia, three tiers of government. But it is not something you can just announce on the fly. In the United Kingdom the deals that have worked well are deals that build on deep relationships that are built up over time between their national government and the administrations of their cities. No such relationship was present in any of the examples that were announced during the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no such possibility of a bottom-up approach. There were no leaders in those cities or towns coming to government with concrete proposals about specific things that could happen that would make their city function better. None of this was evident. We did not see any of this. In fact, instead what we saw was a situation where the coalition was, in the case of Townsville, merely seeking to emulate campaign commitments that had been made by the Labor Party many months earlier. So terrified were they of their electoral prospects in Townsville that they simply sought to replicate what we had committed. They wrapped it up in a new thing with 'City Deal' put around it. But of course it was nothing like a City Deal. There was nothing like the conceptual or policy underpinnings that make it work so well in the United Kingdom. Plainly none of the work at all had been done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I followed this up during the estimates process. I asked: how is this City Deal process going? What did I learn? In terms of the next steps—apart from these three deals that they have announced—I learnt that every first minister has had a letter inviting them to engage in a process and nominate perhaps a city that they might like to have involved in this City Deal process, which is still terribly opaque. There is no detail of whether there is going to be any further expansion of the program beyond just the one capital city that first ministers have been asked to contribute about. In fact, we were told by officials that details of this process are still being worked through. I asked about the cities reference group, a reference group that had been announced by Mr Taylor some time earlier. But again I learnt from officials that, as at estimates—and I have not seen any media subsequently to suggest that anything has changed—this promised governance body, this 'cities reference group' has no members. The membership of the group is yet to be announced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps to reassure people that there had been some thinking, some policy work, done about cities, there is a public commitment that the government will publish a generic City Deal process document. 'Where is that up to?' I asked the officials. 'Well, Senator, that's something we hope to publish shortly,' was essentially the answer. I asked what other policy work was going on, and the officials explained that they were working with states and territories to establish a pipeline. And I said to them, 'But aren't you establishing a competitive bid process? Isn't that what the earlier document we were talking about was going to be?' And they said, 'Well, we're doing both things at the same time.' I asked, 'Well, it seems unusual. Normally a competitive bid process is what happens at the start, and then a pipeline is established, and then you select.' They explained to me that these were two things that were going on simultaneously. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked them when the promised national cities performance framework would be published, and they said it would be published in the second half of 2017. All I can conclude from that sorry exchange—and anyone who is listening might want to go and check out the estimates hearing with Prime Minister and Cabinet on that Monday night the last time we met and just have a look at how little detail there is about how this so-called City Deal is going to work and how little progress has been made since the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely shocking. It is scandalous because this was a policy announced with great fanfare during the election, and yet there is absolutely nothing behind it. I am confident that the officials who are working on this are very, very capable, skilful public servants, and I am sure they are putting their all into crafting something that will work, that will deliver for cities. But isn't it a terrible shame that this is something that is being done after the announcement by the Prime Minister and the assistant minister? Isn't this work that you might want to do before you went out? It just convinces me, as so many things do with this government, that the person who has most influence in the Prime Minister's office is not the policy adviser; it is the press officer. It is the media advisers who are telling the Prime Minister, 'This would be a good thing to go out and talk about,' but there is so little thought given to the actual policy that underpins the media release, and this is a case par excellence. This is an absolute debacle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great shame, because we talk a lot in this chamber about the imperatives to restore productivity to the Australian economy. We had a long discussion about how industrial relations reform in just one sector of the Australian economy, the construction sector, was the thing—'the thing'. It was said at the time that we had the debate about the ABCC that this reform would be the thing to unlock productivity. We are having a discussion now about how cutting penalty rates on Sundays will be the thing to unlock productivity in the Australian economy. What nonsense, because some of the things that really would unlock productivity are sitting right in front of us, but they get no attention; no weight is given to them by the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cities are absolutely essential to Australian productivity. Four out of every five Australians live in a big city, and by 2031 our four largest capitals, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, will have increased in size by 46 per cent. Adelaide, Canberra, Hobart and Darwin are expected to grow by nearly 30 per cent. Australian cities produce 80 per cent of our GDP. In 2015-16, Sydney's GDP alone was $400.9 billion, and it represented 24.1 per cent of our national GDP. The truth is that our transformation, our involvement in the knowledge economy, sees the CBDs in our cities right at the heart of national productivity, but there are real barriers to realising this productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Urban congestion is not just an annoyance. I know that there are many people listening who really do find it very, very annoying, but the truth is that it is also expensive. Infrastructure Australia says that urban congestion will cost the nation $53 billion in lost productivity by 2031 if left unchecked. We hear the calls again and again from some of our most senior policymakers for government to address this. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, called on Australia to lift infrastructure investment to boost the national economy and address traffic congestion. Mr Lowe said that improving the state of the budget should not preclude investing in rail and roads to meet community needs, to lift productivity but also to address that incredible irritation that so many of our city dwellers experience in terms of congestion. Mr Lowe said that increased investment in transport infrastructure would help housing affordability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is such an important point because housing affordability and the location of suitable housing linked to jobs are just essential for employment. We often talk about the increased benefits of connectivity, but transport is not an end to itself. It is a link between the places we are and the places we want to be and the things we want to do. It has an oversized impact on quality of life, and it has surprising flow-on effects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some suburbs, when you think about employment, only 14 per cent of all the jobs available in my home city of Sydney can be accessed even if you drive for 45 minutes. Take that in for a minute. People are living in suburbs where, if they are seeking work and they are willing to sit in a car for 45 minutes to reach that place of employment, still only 14 per cent of all of the available jobs can be found. This is disgraceful. The situation is worse if you are reliant on public transport. Many outer suburbs of Sydney offer access to fewer than one in 10 of the city's jobs within an hour on public transport. You are willing to travel on a bus or a train for an hour, and still you can only get access to one in 10 of the city's jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are completely unacceptable statistics, and they go to the heart of why a serious cities policy is absolutely essential for dealing with unemployment and for dealing with productivity. But that is not what we see from the government. Instead what we see is a completely incoherent process. And—back to the starting point of this conversation—when we ask questions about it, when we place questions on notice, they are not answered. We are well beyond the deadline, and the minister really ought to provide an explanation as to what is going on with the City Deals and why it is that he has taken so very long to answer my question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  Clearly, Madam Deputy President, the government have been found wanting once again with regard to providing information. Certainly, the direction to give notice to the senator was provided at a quarter to two, and I am very sorry that the minister did not actually have an answer prepared way ahead of this, seeing as this is a very, very important matter. Under standing order 74(5)(b), I move:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the questions that are put on notice by this opposition to this government continue to be treated with the contempt that we just saw in that display, that fit of pique, by the minister on duty here in the chamber, Senator McGrath. The reality is that these questions, which were put on notice over a month ago, go to important matters that Australians have the right to have information about. It goes to the attitude that this government has about having any accountability at all for the things that it says and that it promises to this country. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the questions that I put on notice was around deregulation with regard to the Department of Communications and the Arts. One of the things the government like to bang on about, day after day, week after week, is how fantastic they are at managing regulatory reform. Yet, when they were asked simple questions, or what I thought would have been relatively simple questions, such as, 'What is the Department of Communications and the Arts net progress, for 2016 to date, for regulatory savings and costs,' they were unable to answer that on the day, despite claiming to be the champions of deregulation. They are still unable to answer it, more than a month later. We asked:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How many regulatory and deregulatory proposals were costed in 2016.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, there is no answer. Here we are more than a month later, and there is still no response. We asked if the government might provide some accountability to the Australian people for this great agenda that they have with regard to deregulation, asking if they would be publishing a report to summarise what they have been doing with deregulatory and regulatory measures and their associated savings and costs that they were going to try and bank over 2016.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to the Department of Communications and the Arts annual report 2015-16. On page 31, under 'Targets, measurement, results'—which gives the general reader the impression they are accountable for what they are doing—they claim, in black and white:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Our target is to reduce the burden of red tape and onerous regulation in the communications sector, including efforts to meet the Australian Government's commitment to reducing the costs of excessive regulation by $1 billion per year.</span>

                  </a>  The government in their annual report indicate that they have initiatives to generate annual savings of $250 million for businesses and consumers in the communications sector. They said that their reforms were significant and that they were going to be able to achieve these savings. Yet, when asked for a cost assessment of their regulatory and deregulatory measures, they were unable to provide it. That is an indication not only of their failure to be transparent with the Australian people but also that they are making a mockery of the important processes of this Senate and the accountability that they should be able to manage when we go into estimates sessions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were other questions on two major matters that I know are of great interest to the Australian people, and one is in regard to Australia Post—again, with some need for detail. Australia Post provides a great and significant service to the country, but it is also quite a significant financial entity. Australia Post is responsible for providing a letter delivery service. But, as we have heard in a number of hearings over recent times, a diversification of that business has occurred with regard to parcel delivery. That is perhaps where Australians are really finding that service quite valuable, as things change. We know, though, that the valuation of Australia Post is of vital importance to Australia's national accounts figures and for Australians to understand what the value of that particular asset is. In one of these questions on notice, the minister was asked to confirm what the administered investment value of Australia Post was in the most recent annual report. But the department of communications were unable to provide an answer. Again, they have had that question for more than one month, since 16 February, and no response has been provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a particularly important dimension to the questions that were asked on notice by us in opposition, and that is in regard to the valuation of Australia Post and the change of that information from 2014-15 through to the current period. The valuation, of course, is a vital element of the government's accounting, and the figures that are here represented on an annual basis to make sure that the Australia people can see what is going on. The questions that we asked seem pretty innocuous to me and they seem like ones that should not be too difficult to answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With reference to that valuation of Australia Post, we asked further questions about when the most recent valuation of Australia Post was undertaken. We sought to ascertain by whom that valuation might have been undertaken. There was no information. It is a relatively reasonable request for information. It should have been something that the government were able to answer. When we asked for details about how long the valuation document was, they could not answer. We started to wonder if, indeed, there was a valuation document. We asked for the commencement date and the completion date of the processes that were to be provided. We asked for relevant contract notices, if there was indeed an independent valuation undertaken. None of that information was forthcoming on that day, and it still has not been provided to us here in the Senate. We wanted to know about how these figures informed the department's current financial statement. It is pretty well known to every small company across the country that you have your financial statements and you keep them in order and you have fair and reasonable valuations. This government, sadly, could not provide the answers to those questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Questions 376, 375 and 374 go to the NBN. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this matter, because this government has proven itself to fail on the three areas that it indicated it was going to be a success in terms of delivering the NBN. You might remember the mantra that they put out prior to the election: cheaper, faster and sooner. That was their promise on the NBN. Let us have a look at their record so far and why we should be paying particularly close attention to what they are doing with the accounts. The 'sooner' claim was made by Malcom Turnbull when he made the announcement that he was going to dismantle the proper rollout of fibre to all the premises, both businesses and homes. Malcom said that he would get it to Australians sooner by changing it to a multitechnology mix. Indeed, he made his commitment that by the end of 2016 Australians would have his cheaper, sooner, faster NBN. It is 2017, and I know that right around this country those who have received the NBN so far are extremely unhappy about the service that has been provided by the NBN to the node. I know that those who are waiting for it still do not have adequate information about what is going to come to them. The timelines are all over the place. The government are running and hiding from the commitments that Mr Turnbull made when he was the minister for communications and is failing to honour in his continuing role as the Prime Minister of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They failed on the 'sooner'. Let us have a look at their next promise. They said that they would deliver a 'faster' NBN. It is not faster, because it has not arrived in the time that they said, but it is not faster even if you do have it. Around the world, Australia's aspiration for a speed of 25 megabits down and five megabits up is a joke. If you offer it to people in any country around the world that has a decent NBN, they cannot believe that Australia is proceeding with this subpar, subgrade advance of what this government are determined to call a super-fast broadband. There is no way it is fast and there is no way it competes with our international competitors in the world economy. It is a fail for speed. We know that with fibre to the node you have got a fibre network that is based on the movement of information at the speed of light all the way to a corner near you. Then it hits a box on that corner and from that point it is a goat track to your home. That is the technology that Malcom Turnbull has delivered to large chunks of Australia with fibre to the node. He has failed with regard to speed tests on that network, and the further away your home is from the node, the worse the service that you get. It does not matter if you are running a very successful small business in a regional part of Australia, say down in the Riverina or where I come from on the Central Coast or in regional parts of Tasmania or Western Australia, it does not matter if you are an innovative business ready to do business, if you are more than a few hundred metres away from that node, the speed that you are going to get is totally inadequate. It will not help you grow your business, grow jobs and grow the wealth of the community in which you want to provide that service too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that businesses are reporting left and right that the reliability of the particular version of the NBN that Mr Turnbull has decided is satisfactory for Australians is completely under par. There are businesses that are trying to make orders and do jobs and are finding that they are constantly losing their capacity to put those orders through, because their line is dropping out. That is the type of NBN that we have seen delivered thus far by the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the fact that Mr Turnbull has failed on the 'sooner' part and failed on the 'faster' speed part, we are entitled to pay close attention to what is happening with regard to the 'cheaper' claim that the government says that they could do. You might remember that they made a great deal when they were in opposition about $56 billion worth of investment in infrastructure for this country so that we could compete on an even playing field with our international competitors around the world and so that we could have access to education and access to business opportunities and access to health with a ubiquitous market where 100 megabits down and 25 megabits up would be guaranteed to all Australians. That they failed on, and they have not declared in any transparent way what they are doing with the real costs of the NBN. They said to the Australian people that they would invest $29 billion. Towards the end of last year the community and industry saw how bad the NBN rollout is. Nobody in the private sector wanted to invest in the NBN that Malcom Turnbull was delivering. So, instead of that, the government decided to put $20 billion more of Australian taxpayers' money in. It is now up to $49 billion on their watch. We have a lemon, rather than a ubiquitous, high-quality NBN rollout of genuinely fast broadband across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions that I asked in the course of that estimates around in February went to the financial assets that were noted in the communication and arts annual reports of 2014 and 2015. In the 2015 report there was a valuation of the NBN Co as $7.708 billion. When we had a look at the 2015 figure revised in the next annual report, that figure was revised up to $8.5 billion. We asked the minister to confirm whether the $793 million upward adjustment was reflective of an independent review, which is referred to in the document on page 112, footnote No. 3. It states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Administered investment valuation in the NBN Co Limited is based on its net assets balance with the property, plant and equipment adjusted for fair value and the discounting of leave and superannuation liabilities adjusted by applying the Government bond rate. These adjustments were required to reflect the NBN Co Limited at fair value in the financial statements. The impact of these adjustments was an increase of $1.046 billion at 30 June 2016 and an adjustment of $793 million to the net assets at 30 June 2015 totalling $8.501 billion. The 2015 amount reflects this adjustment. An independent review has been undertaken to ascertain the fair value of property, plant and equipment in June 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is we asked about that independent review, but, when it came to getting an answer about the nature of that independent review, what we heard was silence—at least that was the case until today, when we heard that extraordinary outburst when we asked for a reason why the answer has not been forthcoming so far.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We asked if the independent review to ascertain that fair value of NBN Co, which was undertaken in June 2016, had been made public. Was it available? Could a copy be provided to us so that we could actually read and understand what it is that the government is claiming is the value of the NBN. Why does it matter? It matters for those reasons that I articulated a little while ago. The government has been found to be completely out of touch with reality when it refers to its commitment to deliver the NBN sooner. The government has failed its own test to deliver a faster NBN. Faster delivery is certainly not the case. Australians are not getting what they thought they were going to get. That has been compromised by Malcolm Turnbull's multi-technology mix, which is compromising Australians' capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also fear, which is why we asked these questions, that Australians are getting a raw deal in terms of the money that is being expended on this lemon of an NBN. We are just simply asking for some transparency and accountability around what is going on with these valuations. I do not know about everyone else in this chamber, but it seems to me that a few billion dollars here or there matters quite a bit. One of the concerns we have with regard to this independent review is what the government's practices are in terms of its determination of what I asked the department do around the nature of this review. Is this a review that is undertaken every year, or is it just this year that they undertook it to make some adjustment that might make it look a little bit better? Everything else we see around NBN looks like a bit of a con, frankly. We are concerned that these numbers are part of that game of presenting one image about the NBN, when the reality behind it is something quite different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We asked to find out if the contract notices for the independent review, which they claim is independent, could be provided. We have not heard a word about that, and we certainly have not seen those relevant contract notices. We wanted to know at whose direction the review was initiated. We have not had an answer to that. We wanted to know what entity conducted the so-called independent review. I fear that we might get answers that will not be at all satisfactory, and that the government is not committed to providing them in a transparent way but will rather mask what has been going on in this space. We asked how long the review was, we asked what date it was initiated and we asked when the minister might receive this independent review. Sadly, we still have no information at all about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the history of the national broadband that this is one of the government's great failures. On 11 October, Malcolm Turnbull hailed the coalition's NBN as one of the 'great corporate turnarounds' in Australia's history. He did not really mean what it is that he has delivered. If by 'great turnaround' the Prime Minister means backflipping on every NBN promise made to the Australian people, falling short on every target and overseeing soaring complaints by our constituents, then, yes, he is correct: it is truly one of the most astounding turnarounds in Australia's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's litany of failures with regard to the NBN really is absolutely embarrassing for this nation. We had an opportunity under the Gillard government and under the leadership of Stephen Conroy to develop a ubiquitous, high-quality, genuinely superfast network around the country; sadly, what we have got under Malcolm Turnbull is a very sad reflection of that. Mr Turnbull promised that he would deliver the NBN for $29 billion. Under his watch—firstly, as the Minister for Communications responsible for setting the direction, and now as the Prime Minister responsible for accounting for where we are—that has blown out to $54 billion. That is a cool $25 billion that he got wrong. No wonder we are concerned about the reporting of the financial reports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Add that to his $50 billion proposed corporate tax cuts, and you can see that this is a government that is not responsible with Australian taxpayer dollars and has wasted a fantastic opportunity to invest in genuine infrastructure and productivity gains for this country. It has been blown away by Malcolm Turnbull's amazing ego, which has allowed him to inflict on this country a second-rate, perhaps a third-rate, national broadband system that will not serve our purposes. We have got seven million Australians waiting for the NBN, despite passing the date that Mr Turnbull promised them that they would have it by—that is, the end of 2016. Day by day, the folly of this government's second-rate copper network is being exposed. That is why we should have answers to these questions. This government cannot be trusted on the NBN; it needs scrutiny. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Dastyari and Kitching today relating to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Excitingly, I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Brandis to questions asked by Senators Dastyari and Kitching in question time—if we can remember them. In terms of the process, it was very interesting to hear Senator Brandis talk about the deep commitment the Prime Minister has to ensuring that there is equality in our nation and that people will not be harmed by any changes proposed to the Racial Discrimination Act. It was important that that statement was made in this place. But what is really clear is that that statement needs to be understood and made in the wider community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since yesterday, when the proposal to change the Racial Discrimination Act was made public, on the international day to prevent discrimination on the grounds of race, we have seen widespread concern about the decision. We expected that there would be a wide range of views on this decision. But those of us who had the honour to be on the human rights committee, which considered over a couple of months the issue of free speech and the Racial Discrimination Act, were taken by surprise at the speed with which the government has now made the decision to implement a change that was not recommended by the committee—if anybody has read that report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report is valuable because it is a snapshot of people's opinion on the issue of the Racial Discrimination Act at a point in time. It exposes a wide range of concerns about how we identify free speech in our country. It talks about people's attachment to the proposals that are currently in the act. It talks about issues of administration. Indeed, a number of the recommendations the committee made were on administrative changes to ensure that the act is administered in a more streamlined fashion. We felt that there was a degree of concern and agreement around those administrative changes. One of the absolutely reinforcing processes in that committee was a deep commitment to the concern around making sure our community did not have harm through discrimination on the basis of race. And there was respect for the continuing efforts to ensure, over a number of years, from the time this legislation was originally developed, that exactly how the act would operate came from within the commission itself and also through the legal process. It was reinforcing to see that, in many cases, there was an understanding of exactly what discrimination meant, what caused hurt, what caused offense and what caused harm. That was the core element of the discussions we had over many weeks, in many parts of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was not genuine, ongoing, complete support for change. There was support for needing to maintain aspects that showed respect on the basis of race throughout our community, but there was not a clamouring for change. There were a number of people who raised issues, and that must be acknowledged. I think it is a good thing that we would take the opportunity to review any legislation, but particularly legislation as sensitive as this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have heard since the Prime Minister put out the cabinet decision to make the change to the act is a deep worry in the community, particularly from those who are concerned about how those with racial differences will be treated by other Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important for all of us to stop and think about the people who will be impacted and are impacted by the legislation as it now exists. The voice of any person who feels they have been subjected to racial discrimination should be given special respect because they understand what it is like to feel they have been racially abused. I have not had that experience but, on the committee, I heard from many people who did. The majority of those people—and I say that openly—who felt they had experienced racial abuse or had known people who had been racially abused are deeply concerned about any changes to the legislation. In fact, they would hope that the evidence we receive, which is on record in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, is heard. I hope that senators who are making contributions to this debate will have read that evidence and will know how fearful people are. They are fearful that the act that was designed to protect them and support them will now once again be party to debate in this place and the wider community about ways to change the act—but not necessarily improve it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I think there is an awful lot here that we can agree upon. All Australians have the right to live free from fear of violence and racial discrimination. This we can all agree upon. But the fact is that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is bad legislation. It is bad law and it simply does not work. It has not reduced racial vilification or done what it has set out to do. Instead, it has captured in its web students from the Queensland University of Technology. University is a place where ideas should be contested and people should feel free to say whatever it is they want. All that these students did was question the fairness of an Indigenous-only computer lab, and they did it on social media. This is not harassment in any way, shape or form. Section 18C captured in its web a cartoonist whose sole purpose in life was to satirise. But it did not capture a single participant in violent anti-immigration rallies in Melbourne last November and last June. It did not capture a single participant in the Reclaim Australia rallies in Sydney last July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The law is not working. The law needs to be amended. I honestly feel that the amendments that have been suggested to both the wording and the process are measured in their response and will make this law more effective. The law was developed with good intentions; Senator Moore is absolutely correct there. It was established to defend the vulnerable, to articulate the principles of a successful multicultural society and to reflect our values of inclusion and acceptance. But it is a bad law that does not achieve its objectives. As legislators it is our responsibility to change laws that do not meet their objectives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of stopping racial vilification, it actually has the practical effect of making it unlawful to hurt people's feelings. That is such a subjective term. Such a subjective benchmark is impossible to maintain. It is political correctness gone mad. The only sensible course of action is to amend section 18C to direct it towards far more serious conduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel that the government responded appropriately to this problem. It was the right approach to convene the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. My understanding is that the work that was done by that committee was done respectfully, thoughtfully and very thoroughly. The work on this particularly vexed and contentious issue was done with the best intentions. The report from the committee is highly valued. I also would like to commend my coalition colleagues, the Prime Minister and cabinet for the mature, considered and respectful debate and for the way this bill was developed and delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a quick look at what changes are made. The bill proposes reforms to the wording of the act as well as reforms to the complaint-handling processes of the AHRC. The current wording clearly lacks credibility. We are removing the highly subjective and emotive words of 'offend, insult and humiliate' and replacing them with the word 'harass', which is a far more powerful word and one which better describes the behaviour we all want to see outlawed. The current language in the Racial Discrimination Act lacks credibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not lost on me or anyone on this side of the chamber that yesterday was Harmony Day. We are a proud nation of migrants. We are also a nation that values our freedoms. The freedom of speech is fundamental, elemental, to all other freedoms. The changes proposed to the Racial Discrimination Act are not something we should fear but are something we should embrace. This is not a watering down of the law. It creates a clearer, stronger and far more credible law. Most importantly, it is a balanced law that will defend free speech and protect Australians from genuine racial discrimination.</span>

What can I say other than wow? How extraordinary to have this legislation announced on Harmony Day. It is a watering down of the antidiscrimination and antiracism laws that have well served our nation. It is also an incredible example of our dysfunctional and divided government. The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have reassured this parliament numerous times that there would be no changes to section 18C. We have here a government that is giving in to not only the far Right wing of the Liberal Party but also to One Nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week a friend of mine, Jesse Fleay, spoke of our Prime Minister and wrote on Facebook:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Imagine spending your entire political career posing as a progressive pinup boy and alternative leader of the Liberal Party only to get the top job and operate as the most conservative leader in Liberal Party history, for the simple reason that will follow Malcolm Turnbull to the tomb for the simple reason that you have no courage to stand up to your own party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again we have had the likes of Senator Brandis and our Prime Minister reassuring the Australian nation that they will stand up for decent Australian values and that they will stand up against racism and vilification in our country, only to announce on Harmony Day this dramatic change in the law. This demonstrates that the Australian people cannot trust a word that this government says.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Dastyari pointed out in his question, on 16 occasions the Prime Minister ruled out changes to the Racial Discrimination Act—16 times. He also pointed out that Peta Credlin said that the most vociferous person in the coalition against 18C was Malcolm Turnbull. I wonder when the PM decided to join the pests seeking changes to 18C. She said, 'I too wonder when the PM decided to join the pests seeking to change it.' But again we see Malcolm Turnbull has changed his mind. Again he and Senator Brandis stood in front of the media and told us of their intentions to water down protections against hate speech in our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The incredible thing is—and we have seen Senator Brandis do this numerous times in this place—that he cannot even admit the backflip. There are examples after examples of him not being able to recall something relating to serious issues in this place. We hear this day in and day out. Is it yet another example of Senator Brandis not being up-to-date with what is in the media on any given day? It is simply absurd that time and time again the highest law officer in our nation is not up-to-date with matters in his portfolio and, as we are debating, does not give adequate answers to this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke in this chamber some six months ago seeking reassurances from Senator Brandis and from the Prime Minister that they would not give in to the conservative backbench of the Liberal Party and make changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. How desperately badly have we been let down. The fact that they will not stand up for mainstream values is a terrible sign of the dysfunction and division in this government. They will not do things like implement marriage equality. They will not stand up for the current 18C protections. They will not get on with creating jobs and apprenticeships. Instead, they are absolutely besotted by the backroom, right wing— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WILLIAMS:</span>
                  </a>  Honestly, Senator Watt, I had never heard of it until it came forward in relation to your state of Queensland, with Mr Alex Wood and his fellow students at the Queensland University of Technology. What did they do? They went into a laboratory at the university. It is reported that the laboratory was for Indigenous people only. So they left and posted something on Facebook. The next thing was the courts. Ms Prior was suing these students for the sum of $250,000. Alex Wood has been hit for $41,000 in legal fees, four years after Ms Prior told him to leave an Indigenous-only computer lab because he was white. I find this quite amazing, and I am sure many Australians find it quite amazing as well. I thought computer laboratories were for all people—but apparently not. Regardless of where you are from or the colour of your skin, I think laboratories should be for all—and I think many Australians would agree with me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue is these words 'insult or offend'. It is just crazy, because I cannot see why anyone would ever be insulted or offended when they are respected. In this world, in this life, you cannot demand respect; you have to earn respect. If people respect you, they will never insult you or offend you anyway. The legislation is so confusing, even for Ms Triggs, who does not have an understanding of it. The government is proposing to remove those words and replace them with the word 'harass'. So it is a case of whether you are being harassed because of your race—basically because of where your parents came from, what country you came from or what colour you are. I find this whole thing amazing. As I said, it is not a big issue in regional Australia with the people that I talk to. People do not stop me in the streets and say, 'Hey, you've got to fix 18C.' I welcome the government's change, because I just think those students being sued was just ridiculous. It would have put pressure on them going through the courts for such a long time. We know how the courts drag on and drag out matters. What those students have been through because they went into a laboratory is quite amazing. Let's hope the legislation proposed by the government—and I do welcome it—will, for a start, simplify it. Many of those involved in court cases over the wording of 18C do not understand the actual meaning of it, how it is supposed to work or how it is supposed to protect or whatever. It is confusing. As I said, Ms Triggs, from the Human Rights Commission, has even been confused about it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Simplifying 18C is a good thing. We can all understand a simple law. The word 'harass' is not a watering down of the law. I just call that simplifying the law and making it better for Australians to understand. There are those who follow this issue. Many people email me and say, 'Wacka, we've got to fix this up; it's wrong.' And if it is wrong—and I believe it is wrong—it needs to be fixed up. As I said, it is not the biggest issue in rural Australia. Building some dams, building railway lines, growing more export markets and keeping good cattle prices continuing are issues—yes. Cattle prices are under a bit of pressure at the moment. They did get extremely high, and perhaps that was a bit of a worry in itself. These are the issues that regional Australians are concerned about. We have a good wool market, with record wool prices. It is good to see that after decades of devastating wool prices, following the crash back in the early nineties. Cattle prices are improving. I will say it again: those opposite banned the live exports to Indonesia—a crazy decision that had such a devastating effect on regional Australia. We saw cattle being transported by road from the top of Western Australia right down to Inverell, in the district I live in. How cruel it is to have to transport the stock so far because of the loss of the export markets. They are the real issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's hope that we can continue to grow those markets and grow our trade agreements. Former Minister Andrew Robb did a magnificent job setting up the free trade agreements, and now we are benefiting from those agreements with better prices for our commodities. Because of rural Australia, we saw growth in the last quarter for our agriculture exports. Things are exciting. I just hope the regions that are very dry at the moment do get some gentle rains, especially in Queensland, where once again they are looking to the skies for some relief. I commend the government for simplifying this whole law. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I also rise to take note of Senator Brandis's comments in answers today about the government's proposed amendment of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. I was thinking earlier about how, when you come down to Canberra, you sometimes miss your kids and you think about the kind of parent you are and about the kind of child that you want to raise. I was thinking about the fact that pretty much everyone in this chamber, no matter what party they are from, would be trying, as a parent, to teach their kids how important it is to be respectful of other people. I do not think that there are many values that you can teach your children that are more important in setting them up in life than the need to be respectful of other people, no matter who they are, no matter what country they are from and no matter what colour their skin—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATT:</span>
                  </a>  And Senator Williams agrees with me, just as I agreed with much of what he said. So it is therefore very disappointing that the effect of the changes that the government is seeking to make here will be to create an environment in which people can be much less respectful of others on the basis of their race. It will remove the current prohibition on people offending, insulting or humiliating others on the basis of their race. That is the effect of the change that the government is proposing to make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act prevents people from racially offending, insulting or humiliating others. I would have thought that in a modern society and in a respectful society all of us could agree that it is not appropriate and that it should be against the law for people to racially offend, insult or humiliate others. But of course we know that over the last few months a rump of the extreme right of the Liberal Party, in cahoots with certain media outlets and certain weird barristers from Queensland who shuffle around in duffel coats chasing shadows and making up straw men, have gotten together to make this a crusade which, unfortunately, this weak Prime Minister has jumped on. The effect of this change is to say that it will be okay in future for people to racially offend, insult and humiliate others, and what will not be okay is for people to racially harass others. Of course people should not be able to racially harass others, and that is exactly what the legislation as it currently stands is designed to prevent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we really have here is yet another pathetic backdown from a Prime Minister who used to believe in something. He used to believe in climate change, and now he has given in to the extreme right of his party. He used to believe in marriage equality, and he has now given in to the extreme right of his party. He used to believe in strong laws that prevented people from racially offending, insulting and humiliating people, but again he has had to cave in to the right wing of his party. It is no wonder that Australians have really given up any hope for this Prime Minister. If you are going to lead a country you actually have to be able to show people that you believe in something and that you will stand and fight for it. Instead, we have a Prime Minister who continually caves in to his extreme right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of us knows exactly what it is going to mean to racially harass someone; we will have to wait and see how courts interpret that. All we really have to go on so far is the comments of one of the people who has really driven this campaign, the so-called journalist Andrew Bolt. He was on Sky last night and he speculated that perhaps what would amount to racial harassment is making offensive, insulting and humiliating racial remarks about people maybe five times. Is that correct? Is what we are saying here that it is okay to racially humiliate someone once, it is okay to do it twice, it is okay to do it three or four times, but it is not until you get to five times that it amounts to something that is actually unacceptable in society? I disagree with that. I think it is actually unacceptable to racially humiliate, offend or insult someone once, let alone five times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the limited time I have left, I just want to deal quickly with a couple of the false arguments that have been put up by the government for why this change is needed. Firstly, they have said that the current law means that people cannot make small insulting remarks without breaking the law. That is just not true. No lesser person than the current High Court Chief Justice Susan Kiefel has said that the current law only applies to conduct that has 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights'. It is just wrong that this law is restraining small insults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The free speech argument is also wrong. The current section 18D of the act provides lots of exemption for people making fair political comment, and that would remain in place now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Gallagher today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In question time today much was made about funding cuts coming up in the upcoming budget and also in the omnibus bill. Much has been made about these cuts to funds, and especially about the cuts to legal aid and community legal centres. I have in the past opposed some aspects of the legal aid funding which has gone to convicted killers, but I do support legal aid in principle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The disturbing thing about the planned cuts that are coming now is that legal aid funding has steadily decreased. Both coalition and Labor governments are to blame for this. In 1997 the federal government spent $11.22 per capita, and today we are spending $7.84 per capita. Around 10,000 Australians are forced to represent themselves each year due to these cuts. We are finding that in places like Sydney and Melbourne, where community legal centres are being forced to amalgamate, we are having a problem where victims of domestic violence are having to travel by train or by bus for up to an hour or by car for 45 minutes to get to one of these amalgamated centres. It seems only eight per cent of people these days qualify for legal aid under the current means test. We also find that middle-class Australians are often cut out of the legal aid system. Quite often we have Australians living below the poverty line who do not qualify for legal aid. Look at what is happening overseas: in the United Kingdom they spent double the amount on legal aid per capita that we do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Legal aid and these community legal centres help more than 200,000 people a year, but the centres are forced to turn away more than 150,000 people, often due to a lack of resources. This affects the Family Court. Lack of funding within the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court is resulting in family law issues being forced to wait up to three years for a final trial. We are also finding that victims of domestic violence and victims of sexual assault find themselves in Family Court often having to be cross-examined by the very man who allegedly attacked them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These cuts that have been coming all the time here affect the most vulnerable and the most disenfranchised. They affect the elderly, the young, the disabled, the homeless, the Indigenous and people in rural areas. The list goes on. They affect people from low socio-economic segments of our community. As I said, with the waiting periods of the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court increasing, this delays access to justice. As the founder and leader of the Justice Party, this is just not on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts to legal aid and the community legal centres bypasses access to justice altogether by forcing people who do not meet the means test for legal aid to represent themselves. With the government implementing policies such as the debt recovery system within Centrelink, many defenceless people who do not understand how to respond to a debt recovery notice or do not know what further action to take are hindered of the opportunity to respond as the community legal centre resources are depleting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is why I am very pleased to endorse what has been announced by the Law Council of Australia. They are forming a justice project led by the President, Fiona McLeod SC. They say their project will uncover systematic flaws and ensure the path towards equal access to justice and make it clearly mapped out. They will report their findings by the end of November this year. I am pleased to say that a steering committee of eminent Australians, chaired by the Honourable Robert French AC, the former justice of the Australian High Court, will oversee this project. The president of the council, Fiona McLeod, says: </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Access to justice is a bedrock principle for our society and a means of protecting, promoting and defending the rule of law and human rights of all people. It is a core tenet of our modern democracy, yet unfortunately there are many who are missing out. A person's formal right to justice and equal treatment before the law is of no value if he or she cannot effectively access the legal system or secure protection of basic rights.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the cuts to CLCs and legal aid—and we are also talking about cuts to women's refuge centres, which is an abomination—have to be reversed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will respond to the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights (PJCHR) contained in the report of its inquiry into freedom of speech in Australia, by reforming section 18C of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</span> and amending the complaints-handling processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission (the Commission). The bill also makes minor technical amendments to the Commission's reporting and conciliation requirements, as well as its governance arrangements.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Reasons for Urgency</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There has been significant public debate of reform to section 18C for some years, with growing public concern about that section and the complaints-handling procedures of the Commission following several high-profile cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The importance of the issue to the Australian community was reflected in the strong public engagement with the PJCHR's inquiry. The PJCHR received approximately 11,460 items (submissions, form letters and other pieces of correspondence) and held nine public hearings in each state and territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Demands for reform are widespread and persistent, creating uncertainty for both complainants and respondents to allegations of unlawful discrimination. Introduction and passage of the bill in the 2017 Autumn sitting period would provide certainty for the Australian community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 8 November 2016, the PJCHR was asked to inquire into and report on two issues relating to freedom of speech in Australia. This reference was made in response to growing public concern about the effect of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act on freedom of speech, and about the Commission's complaints handling procedures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The concern arose following certain high profile cases, namely, a cartoon by the late cartoonist Mr Bill Leak which was published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper on 4 August 2016, and a case concerning students from the Queensland University of Technology posting comments on a Facebook page about having been refused access to a computer lab for Indigenous students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCHR received 11,460 items (consisting of submissions, form letters and other pieces of correspondence). The PJCHR held nine public hearings in total, across each state and territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCHR's majority report made 22 recommendations; most concerned the Commission's complaints‑handling processes. The Committee did not reach a concluded view on the appropriate wording of section 18C. Rather, it put forward a range of proposals that had the support of at least one committee member. </span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Why is the Government reforming s. 18C?</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a hallmark of a free and democratic society that all of its members have the right to voice their opinions. That is what freedom of speech means. That freedom of speech is integral to the operation of a liberal democracy has been recognized by the High Court, when it acknowledged that freedom of political communication was a necessary implication of Australia's Constitution. In 2004, Justice Michael Kirby, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Coleman v Power</span>, put it this way:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"In Australia, we tolerate robust public expression of opinions because it is part of our freedom and inherent in the constitutional system of representative democracy. That system requires freedom of communication. It belongs as much to the obsessive, the emotional and the inarticulate as it does to the logical, the cerebral and the restrained."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet, as we know, people have widely differing views. As the great American judge, Oliver Wendell Holmes, said more than a century ago, in his famous opinion in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lochner v New York </span>, "A Constitution … is made for people of fundamentally differing views." As both Michael Kirby and Oliver Wendell Holmes recognized, every citizen of a democracy, whoever they may be, wherever they may stand on any given issue, has an equal and fundamental right to hold and to express their views. And however profoundly others may disagree with or disapprove of those views, we all, as citizens of a democracy, have an obligation to respect the equal right of every other citizen to hold and express their views. As I said in the first speech I ever gave in this Chamber:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"[A] liberal society is only worthy of the name if its citizens enjoy an absolute right to hold, and to express, opinions which other members of society find outrageous. Any attempt to limit that right, whether by actual censorship of opinions or by the insidious new cultural tyranny sometimes called 'political correctness', is a fundamental violation of a free society. For as long as I sit in this place I will defend the absolute right of all citizens to the free expression of their opinions – no matter how unfashionable, ignorant or offensive those opinions may seem to others,"</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We see the clash of fundamentally different views on display every day in the Senate. The very purpose of the Parliament is to bring those views together, as representative of the whole Australian people, and engage in a contest of ideas as we debate the great issues of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sometimes, as we debate those ideas, we will say things that are offensive to others, or insulting, or even humiliating. That is partly because one person's ideas may themselves be offensive to a person who has a completely different point of view, and sometimes because, in making our case, we may hurt the feelings of others. That is the way democracies work. That is why we proudly describe our democracy as "robust". In a democracy, it should never be a reason to censor somebody's participation in debate that others may feel offended, insulted or humiliated by what they say. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What political cartoon, for instance, does not humiliate its subject? That, in a sense, is its very purpose: to make a point sharply, wittily and memorably. That is something the late great Bill Leak – whose spirit presides over this debate – knew better than anyone, which is why his cartoons were so penetrating and so effective. It was something the cartoonists at <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Hebdo</span> knew too, which is why they were a target for authoritarians and fanatics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet s. 18C specifically prohibits the expression of views merely because they may insult, offend or humiliate. It is political censorship, pure and simple. A law like that has no place in a free country. It is not to the point that s. 18D provides certain carve-outs or exemptions: there should not need to be exemptions from a prohibition on free speech, because free speech should never be censored in the first place. And, of course, whatever the exemptions, the very existence in our law of a provision like s. 18C has a chilling effect on freedom of speech which can never be measured, but is inevitably harmful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why the Government is moving to remove these words. They are not words which are necessary to protect people against racial vilification, because we are rewriting the section to provide for <span style="font-style:italic;">stronger </span>protections: by retaining the word "intimidate" and introducing the word "harass". If there is anyone left in this country who sincerely believes that s. 18C should not be reformed, let them ask themselves this question: what kind of anti-racial vilification law fails to prohibit harassment? Those who oppose this reform should ask themselves this question: what is the conduct that they would prohibit which is not already caught by the concepts of harassment and intimidation? It can only be the expression of ideas. Yet the one thing a free society must never do is censor the expression of ideas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Intimidation and harassment, by contrast, are not exercises of free speech. Rather, they are – and have always been acknowledged to be – species of unlawful conduct. The fact that that conduct might take the form of spoken or written words is beside the point. To intimidate another person – in other words, to threaten them or to cause them fear; to harass another person – in other words to vex, to annoy, to attack them – not to express an idea as an opinion. It is to intrude upon that other person's freedom itself. Such conduct has nothing to do with freedom of speech, and its prohibition is entirely justifiable both to protect freedom and to protect social order. That is why I have always believed that there is no inconsistency whatever between effective, appropriately-worded racial vilification laws, and the robust defence of freedom of speech. And that is the principled reason why the Government is moving to reform s. 18C: at the same time, to strengthen its anti-vilification provisions, and to remove its anti-free speech provisions – not inconsistent objectives, but complementary ones.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers that the section 18C, as it is currently drafted, has become an inappropriate barrier to people expressing their legitimate opinions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers there is a clear conceptual distinction between conduct which merely affronts the feelings of a person, and conduct which threatens them. This Bill will clarify the conduct captured by section 18C by replacing the terms 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' with 'harass'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The inclusion of the term 'harass' will reflect the original recommendation of the 1991 National Inquiry into Racist Violence by the then Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which was that the Racial Discrimination Act be amended to 'prohibit racist harassment'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also specify that the standard against which alleged contraventions of section 18C are assessed is that of the reasonable member of the Australian community. This will ensure that the subjective sensitivities of particular groups do not make unlawful conduct which a reasonable member of the Australian community would not judge to be likely to harass or intimidate another person or group. The standard introduced by this Bill is a strong endorsement of the sensibilities of the Australian people. Ordinary and reasonable Australians, from all cultures and backgrounds, can, and do, recognise and reject racial prejudice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act will maintain protections against racial discrimination whilst ensuring that frank and open discussion and debate, however challenging, is not subject to unreasonable legal sanctions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission has an important and legitimate role to play in resolving complaints on unlawful discrimination. However, the Commission's complaints handling model does not operate as effectively as it should. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill responds to recommendations of the PJCHR by amending the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986</span> to ensure that unmeritorious complaints are discouraged or dismissed at each stage of the complaints handling process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill introduces requirements for the Commission to act fairly in the course of inquiring into, and attempting to conciliate a complaint. This extends to offering reasonable assistance to both complainants and respondents. The Bill will also introduce an obligation for the President or the Commission to act expeditiously when dealing with complaints, and to use best endeavours to dispose of complaints within 12 months. These requirements will implement PJCHR recommendations 6, 7 and 8.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will require the President to notify all respondents to a complaint, and any person other than the respondent who is the subject of an adverse allegation in the complaint. These amendments are designed to overcome the situation which arose for the students at the Queensland University of Technology, who were first advised that they were the respondents to a complaint over a year after it had been made. The implements PJCHR recommendation 5.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also raise the threshold for lodging a complaint of unlawful discrimination. At the moment a complaint can constitute as little as a bare allegation in writing that unlawful discrimination has occurred. It is an inefficient use of the Commission's time and resources to finalise such complaints. The amendments will require that a complaint specify the conduct alleged to be unlawful discrimination. It must also be reasonably arguable that this alleged conduct constitutes unlawful discrimination. This will implement PJCHR recommendation 9.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will provide a greater ability for the Commission to terminate unmeritorious complaints, including by introducing new mandatory and discretionary grounds upon which a complaint can be terminated by the President. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The President will also be required to consider whether to terminate a complaint before starting to inquire into the complaint, and the legislation will make clear that regard must be had to any relevant exemptions when considering whether a complaint constitutes unlawful discrimination.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Civil Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill which would amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Acts Interpretation Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">1901, </span>the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Archives Act 1983, </span>the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bankruptcy Act 1966, </span>the <span style="font-style:italic;">Domicile Act 1982, </span>the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evidence Act 1995, </span>the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">1975, </span>the <span style="font-style:italic;">International Arbitration Act 1974, </span>the <span style="font-style:italic;">Legislation Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">2003, </span>the <span style="font-style:italic;">Marriage Act 1961, </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984</span>. The Bill would make minor and technical amendments to modernise, simplify and clarify the legislation, and to repeal redundant provisions. The combined effect of these amendments would improve the efficiency and operation of the civil justice system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government aims to make all Commonwealth legislation coherent, readable and accessible to the widest possible audience. To this end, this Bill would amend the Acts Interpretation Act and the Legislation Act to clarify the validity of Ministerial acts and the management of compilations of legislation on the Federal Register of Legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also aims to make Australia's archival record accessible to the broadest range of applicants possible. To this end, amendments to the Archives Act would assist the National Archives of Australia to appropriately manage requests for records from high volume applicants and make other minor and technical amendments to the Act. The proposed amendments would also simplify the interpretation of the Domicile Act by specifying within the Act the territories to which the Domicile Act applies. This would replace an existing specification of territories in the regulations, allowing that regulation to be repealed. The Bill would also amend the Evidence Act to align the timeframe for the presumed receipt of postal articles with current Australia Post delivery times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also reflects the Government's commitment to maintain its place in the international legal environment by amending the International Arbitration Act to help ensure that Australian arbitral law and practice stay on the global cutting edge, so that Australia continues to gain ground as a competitive arbitration friendly jurisdiction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act would repeal obsolete provisions. The Bill would repeal the combat duties exemption in section 43 of the Sex Discrimination Act that allows discrimination against women in connection with employment, engagement or appointment in Australia Defence Force positions involving combat duties. The exemption is no longer necessary, as the Australian Government's policy to remove all gender restrictions from Australian Defence Force combat roles was fully implemented on 1 January 2016. Repealing this provision is consistent with Australia's intention to withdraw its related combat duties reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Minor and technical amendments contained in the Bill would improve the operation of the Family Law Act by clarifying existing laws, simplifying processes, and remedying inconsistencies. The Bill would make amendments to provide the same rights to de facto and married couples, when instituting maintenance or property proceedings. The Bill would also amend the Family Law Act to clarify that admissibility provisions in the Evidence Act relating to evidence obtained in an improper or illegal manner apply to evidence of disclosures of child abuse in communications between family consultants and family law litigants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill would assist the operation of the Family Court of Australia in a number of ways. The Bill would amend the Family Law Act procedure for appointing members of the Family Court of Australia Rules Advisory Committee, to be consistent with the process for appointment of a similar committee advising the Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. Other amendments to the Family Law Act would clarify the range of persons who may perform the powers of the Registry Managers in the Family Court of Australia and any other court. The Bankruptcy Act would also be amended to clarify that the Family Court of Australia has bankruptcy jurisdiction when a trustee applies to have a binding financial agreement set aside under the Family Law Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill would also make minor, technical amendments to the Marriage Act. Many of these amendments are aimed at improving the operation of the Marriage Celebrants Programme. These measures would enhance administrative efficiency by making improvements to the annual celebrant registration charge process. The Bill would also formalise an existing expectation that marriage celebrants comply with any disciplinary measure that may be imposed by the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants and clarify that the Register of Marriage Celebrants is the publicly available list published on the internet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Bill would provide that where State and Territory employees are appointed according to their position title to perform functions under the Marriage Act, they may be referred to on the Register by their position title rather than their name. Some definitions and terminology would be updated to ensure consistency with other legislation. The Bill would also clarify that certain instruments made under the Act are not legislative instruments, and remedy a defect in the legislation to remake provisions in relation to the Registrar of Overseas Marriages that were repealed in 2002.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In conclusion, the intention of the Bill is to make minor and technical amendments to a number of Acts to increase access to justice for all Australians by improving the operation and clarity of civil justice legislation. Significantly, the amendments contained within the Bill would improve the civil justice system by making it easier for individuals to understand and comply with the law.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill establishes a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the banking and financial services sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill acts on the will of the Parliament for such an inquiry in the absence of action by the Executive Government to issue Letters Patent for a Royal Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This inquiry operates identically to a Royal Commission, but reports to the Parliament, rather than the Government. It is needed to hold the banking and financial services sector to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Banking and finance has become an essential service. It is a fundamental part of a modern economy and modern life. It allows transactions for goods and services to occur; provides for the mitigation and distribution of risk; and, when operating properly, directs investment into meaningful economic activity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the custodians and intermediators of other people's money, the banking and finance sector are granted a privileged position in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This privilege is evident in the guarantees provided by government regarding the continued operation of the sector. This includes explicit government guarantees on deposits and liquidity, and an implicit government guarantee backing those institutions that are too-big-to-fail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This privilege is also given over by customers on the basis of trust. Every day, businesses and households deposit and withdraw money, make payments and investments on the basis of trust. Trust that their money will be there when they need it and that the services they are paying for will be provided fairly and as understood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This trust has broken down and it urgently needs to be repaired.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In recent years, the continuous revelations of misconduct within the banking and financial services sector have undermined the trust of customers and have revealed issues that go the stability of the Australian financial system and the performance and resilience of the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This inquiry will reduce risk and improve stability in Australia's financial system. It will allow us to carve out and cleanse the corrosion that threatens the entire system. As a result, our financial system will be stronger and more resilient, and it needs to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The events of September 2008, the unravelling global financial crisis should still be fresh in our minds. The crisis could have been averted, or at least minimised with a properly regulated and properly incentivised banking and financial system. The recent scandals uncovered in the Australian banking and financial sector indicate that problems persist in the ethical standards, culture and structures of the sector. It places us all at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Misconduct has been uncovered at the financial advice arms of four of the five largest banks, namely the Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Macquarie. The fifth of these five largest banks, Westpac is facing court action for breaching mortgage lending standards, and other banks are under investigation for similar activity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and ANZ were all involved in the impairment of customer loans, particularly in rural areas. ANZ and Westpac have been charged with rigging overnight interest rates. The Commonwealth Bank is facing allegations of fraudulently denying life insurance claims. IOOF have been charged with insider trading. And the collapse of forestry investment schemes has implicated ANZ and Bendigo &amp; Adelaide Bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These scandals have been uncovered thanks to the bravery of whistle-blowers and the determination of investigative journalists. Inquiries of parliamentary committees and Government have also helped examine these matters. However the full extent of misconduct with the banking and financial services sector has not been discovered, particularly given the limited time and resources available to committees of the Parliament, and the inability to utilise expert legal cross-examination and forensic analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The coercive powers of inquiry established by this Bill mimic those typically granted to a Royal Commission. However, in contrast to a Royal Commission, which is the prerogative of the executive to establish under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Commissions Act 1902</span>, this Bill expresses the wish of the Parliament for such an inquiry, and for this inquiry to report to the Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Section 51(xiii) and (xiv) of the Constitution gives the Commonwealth the powers over banking and insurance, and (xx) over financial corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill further defines the banking and financial services sector in accordance with these sections to cover authorised deposit taking institutions (banks), insurance companies, superannuation funds, credit providers (including payday lenders), financial advisors, financial product retailers, or any other financial services license holder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Parliament will appoint a single Commissioner, who is a former Judge, to examine these matters. They will be empowered to examine the extent of misconduct with the banking and financial services sector, the impact of this misconduct on individuals and businesses, and that the risks that this misconduct and other activity poses to the financial system and broader economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner will also be empowered to establish the causal factors of misconduct, including misaligned incentives, culture, inadequate regulation and regulatory power, and 'moral hazard' extending from government guarantees. The Commissioner will have the authority to prioritise those issues that have the greatest potential harm to society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner will be given powers to compel witnesses and the production of evidence so as to properly inform their inquiry. These powers are essential to the exhaustive examination of the terms of reference. These powers are not practically available to the Parliament other than the establishment of properly resourced Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner will report to both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Importantly, this report is to be tabled in parliament and, thus, made available to the Australian public at the same time as it is made available to the executive and other members of Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, this Bill ensures that, in the absence of commensurate action by the executive, the 45th Parliament does everything in its power to ensure that the banking and financial sector is acting in the best interest of its customers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill reiterates that the Australian people are the masters of the broader economy. We are not its servants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the Chamber.</span>

We are strong supporters of supplying housing for those most in need and contributed $6.8 billion in 2016-17 to support social housing and combat homelessness. Our ongoing policy work is aimed at ensuring an adequate and affordable supply of housing for hardworking Australians. The government recognises the aspirations of Australians to own homes and invest in their future. We do not support statements that pit one group of Australians against others or proposals to distort housing markets.</span>

Coal mining is a key contributor to the Australian economy and creates significant employment opportunities and economic activity. In 2015-16 the coal industry was Australia's second-largest export earner with exports worth over $34 billion. This figure is expected to rise to $40 billion for 2016-17.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. The government supports the very important work of the royal commission. The commission is independent, directs its own processes and conducts its own investigations. The inquiry is ongoing. The Australian Embassy to the Holy See ensures that the Vatican is aware of the work and mandate of the commission. The embassy has assisted with document requests and the taking of evidence from Vatican officials in Rome and is unaware of any outstanding requests made by the commission. Because of the commission's independence, a motion to request the production of documents should not be directed at the federal government. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  Flo Seckold has lived in Millers Point for 83 years. She was born there, she went to school there and she met her husband, Teddy, there. Millers Point is part of the famous Rocks, at the southern end of the approach to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Three years ago, Teddy died. The day after Teddy's funeral, Flo received a letter telling her she was to be evicted, evicted from her home, from her community, along with all the other public housing tenants in Millers Point. In a recent interview, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have been crying for three years now and you couldn't get me to cry before that. There is nothing that I haven't loved about living here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the actions of the New South Wales Liberal-National government. Their justification for removing all public housing from Millers Point speaks to a broader problem: how we treat housing. The justification that the government used was that they could sell the land to luxury buyers and use that money to build public housing elsewhere in Sydney. There was no thought, however, given to the fact that houses are more than bricks and mortar. They are people's homes. It is where they may have raised their kids, supported loved ones and formed deep friendships with neighbours, and where they are part of a community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Successive conservative governments deliberately ignore what makes houses homes for people. The Liberal-National government take this uncaring approach because their constituency are property developers and property investors, and their policies are designed to help protect and boost the profits of their backers—the developers and investors. That is why this government has been so unwilling to take on capital gains tax discounts and negative gearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This ideology explains why the government continues to distract people from the reforms to housing in Australia that we so urgently need. We know that reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts will put people seeking a home on more of an even footing when competing at an auction with investors seeking profit. We know that most of the benefits of those tax breaks go to the top income earners and have contributed to the speculation bubble that we are now in. We also know that the billions of dollars spent on these tax breaks could be spent on much-needed public and social housing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet what do we get from the Abbott-Turnbull government? We get a whole lot of deception and a whole lot of rubbish. There has been the rubbish that young people should save their money, not spend it on smashed avocado on toast; the rubbish that young people should raid their superannuation accounts, and the rubbish that young people should get a higher paying job—meanwhile, we know that what the government wants to do is cut penalty rates, and therefore many of those young people would get less money. Then there is the rubbish about the states not releasing enough land on city fringes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Turnbull government went over the top in terms of their own actions. They came up with the ugliest, most insulting idea on the housing crisis—an idea that not only distracts from the real problems of tax breaks and underinvestment in public housing but also scapegoats communities already under attack from the far right and, increasingly, all sections of the Liberal-National party. The headline in the Murdoch papers said it all: 'Send migrants bush to ease house prices'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are not against stimulating regional cities. Indeed, our regions are crying out for more investment, more jobs and better transport links. We wholeheartedly support that. But our cities should also be welcoming of migrants and our newest Australians. I am sure regional Australia would welcome everyone if it was provided with the proper investment and infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this government delivers for its own constituency, and that is why it does not have any policies to solve the housing crisis. One piece of the puzzle is political donations. The Greens' Democracy for Sale project has revealed that the Liberal and National parties, over the past five years, have received more than $10 million from the property sector. This is clearly cash for housing policies that keep housing a commodity. Another piece of the puzzle is political self-interest. Coalition MPs own over 330 properties between them. And, when it comes to the electorates where voters most benefit from investor tax breaks, as with capital gains tax discounts and negative gearing, they are all Liberal-held seats. So self-interest, political interest and financial interest are what are driving this Liberal-National party to allow the real hardship that is developing right across Australia with the growing housing crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have no such conflicts of interest. We will stand up to the speculators and the profit gougers with our plans for secure, affordable housing for all. We are campaigning for sensible and fair tax reform to put people seeking a home on a more even footing with investors. We also want a big boost to the public and community housing sectors, and emergency shelter funding. We need to learn from the progressive European countries that have large, affordable housing sectors serving a wide range of people. The schemes provide high-quality buildings, mixed into the inner city, and guarantee homes for all. In many parts of Europe, people rent for their whole lives. They do not feel compelled to buy a house, because they have security of tenure—something that must come in in Australia to ensure that people can rent their home, can have dignity, can be secure in their future and that their kids can continue to go the local school, and can build links in that community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, the situation in Australia is not good. But let us remember that, after the Second World War, things were different. The federal government then funded one in six new homes. Half of those homes went to returning veterans. It was not a perfect program, but it remains an outstanding achievement, as housing was not regarded as a commodity nor treated in that way but as a deep commitment from the government of the day for homes for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us remember that about 300,000 people were homeless at some stage last year. What would we say if 300,000 students were turned away from school because their parents could not afford to pay? There would be a front-page outcry about that, even in the Murdoch papers, and we would demand a new, transformative, approach. That is what we need for housing now: a transformative approach so that we do have governments committed to homes for all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  The motion we are considering this afternoon asks us to debate how the federal government's housing affordability policy will fail young Australians unless it ends tax breaks for investors, removes stamp duties, and transitions to a broad based land tax. Sadly, I think the motion misdescribes the problem, because the Turnbull government's housing affordability policy has already failed young Australians, and it is at risk of failing other generations as well. The real problem is that this government does not have a policy about housing affordability and has not had a policy about it at any point since it was first elected. What we know so far about its newly discovered interest in this problem are some media lines from Scott Morrison about a package of measures that might be in the budget. Perhaps they are related to his trip to the UK to find out how they do it, or perhaps not, because we do not have any detail whatsoever even about what underpins the thinking of this government when it comes to housing affordability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the government that Rome is burning. Sydney house prices have jumped 70 per cent in the last five years, while average income growth has increased just 13 per cent. This cannot go on. The government has wasted three years of government without dealing with this. The truth is that despite the recent noise about this issue they still do not really know who is in charge of housing affordability. Last week we learnt, through a Senate inquiry, that there is an ongoing and consistent lack of clarity at the ministerial level and the bureaucratic level about who within government is actually responsible for housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since my first days in this place I have been deeply concerned about the complete lack of accountability within the government on this crucial issue. Back in 2015 in an estimates hearing, the Treasury secretary, Mr John Fraser, told the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that the lead agency for housing affordability was the Department of Social Services. I will say that this answer was given after a fair bit of quiet confab between the officers at the table, because, actually, at that point in time, no one in Treasury had it at the top of their mind about who in the government was actually responsible for this issue. At the time the answer that was provided was the Department of Social Services. Earlier this year we saw the appointment of a new Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, the Hon. Michael Sukkar MP. He announced through a media release that he had been given responsibility for housing affordability, amongst other things. But when you dig a little deeper into this you see it is all still pretty murky and it is all still pretty unclear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From questions during the last couple of weeks through estimates and through the administrative orders inquiry held by the Finance and Public Administration Reference Committee, what did we find out? Everybody has got a different story about who is in charge and who is doing what. The Treasury tells us that they do not lead, that everybody cooperates together, but that Prime Minister and Cabinet chairs an interdepartmental committee on the matter, despite not having portfolio responsibility for housing. Incidentally, this committee was formed back in December, when they discovered, belatedly, that this might be an issue of interest to Australians. Under the published administrative orders the Department of Social Services does have responsibility for housing affordability. That seems to be still in place. Senator Cormann told us in estimates that the Treasurer is described as having responsibility for housing affordability in cabinet, but only to extent that measures are relevant to the economics team, and the truth is that published administrative orders limit the Treasurer's role to housing supply. The Treasury did confirm that its assistant minister is responsible for housing policy. Finally, although the government is very, very keen to talk about housing supply, absolutely nobody is responsible for considering housing demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A piecemeal approach—a complete disorganisation—has contributed to total policy paralysis in this area. I have heard many explanations from various bureaucrats about how this is complex, how we need a whole-of-government approach and how, naturally, there are many parts of government that have a contribution to make on this et cetera. Everybody agrees that it is complex, and I do not need to be convinced that this is a complex policy area. But unless it is clear who is in charge and who is leading on this issue, we will see no progress. It is unsurprising to me that after three years this government has produced absolutely nothing of substance in relation to housing policy. At the same time we are hearing a chorus of concerns from all sorts of participants in the market about the rate of growth of investor loans and the level of household debt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us start with debt. Australians carry challenging levels of household debt. The data shows that we are actually leading the world. I know that we Australians like to win things, but this is not the kind of competition that you want to win. Australian household debt makes up 187 per cent of total disposable income and that is one of the highest rates in the world. The effect of this situation on families and households is great insecurity. In this situation people are understandably nervous about small changes in the economy that might impact on their ability to sustain and carry that debt. Some of our regulators are beginning to sound the alarm. The RBA Governor has spoken about it, and the RBA's minutes have noted that borrowing for housing by investors is also picking up. The growth in household debt is faster than growth in household income, and there is now a discussion about another round of macroprudential controls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Macroprudential controls for the investment market are considered to be a last resort by our regulatory institutions to curb excesses in the property market. They are deployed when the risks associated with exposure to mortgages appear to be too great or possibly are too great. In early 2015, APRA imposed restraints that required banks to achieve growth of less than 10 per cent in annual investor lending, and it is concerning to see the regulators now noting that investor demand for loans has rebounded and is again approaching that threshold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government needs to take some responsibility for this situation, because the current policy settings are putting intense pressure on the housing market. The Governor of the Reserve Bank noted this month that recent data 'suggests that there had been a build-up of risks associated with the housing market'. The ASIC chairman, Greg Medcraft, said there was little doubt that a real estate bubble existed in Sydney and Melbourne. No-one in that position would use the word 'bubble' lightly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing market is under pressure by continued surges in investment borrowing and prices in Sydney and Melbourne. In January, we saw that loans to investors in property had risen by 28 per cent since last May. There is no ambiguity about why. Tax concessions for investors are significantly contributing to this situation. That is why Labor have been very clear about our intentions. We introduced reform proposals on negative gearing and capital gains tax more than a year ago. These changes limit negative gearing tax concessions to newly built homes. They reduce the capital gains tax concession from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. It produces a budget saving; this is positive for the budget. It would save the budget $565 million over four years. You would think a coalition government that talks endlessly about the imperative for budget repair would embrace these reforms. But, no, that is not the situation. The coalition has doggedly opposed these measured, responsible reforms—reforms that go to system stability, that go to household security and that go to budget repair. These have not even been contemplated by the coalition. We have broader policies that are also important. I know my colleague Senator Cameron will want to talk about housing and homelessness, issues about which he is incredibly passionate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the raw facts are these: without an actual plan to intervene in this policy area, to secure a future for Australians, and particularly young Australians, we face a very grave future. And young Australians in particular risk having their lifetime financial security compromised. The current policies on negative gearing and capital gains tax generate great benefits for the wealthy, and it is time for government to take seriously proposals to address this distortion in our housing market.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that 68 per cent of the income of a person on an average weekly income was spent on charges to government—68 per cent. That is equivalent to your wages for working from Monday to smoko mid-morning Thursday paying the government: rates, levies, fees, charges, GST, special charges and so on. Sixty-eight per cent; working three and one-third days out of five. The rest is all the people have left to spend on their own lives. That was from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Think about some of these things. The price of food as basic as a loaf of bread—50 per cent tax. Sorry; that is the cost of a loaf of bread. Then there is housing. Studies have shown that around 88 per cent of the cost of a house is tax, and I will talk more about that in a minute. The price of petrol: 70 per cent is made up of tax. When we look at food, when we look at bread, 50 per cent of the cost of a loaf of bread is tax. So in effect that is a 100 per cent tax rate—an effective tax rate of 100 per cent. Convert the housing; that is almost 100 per cent effective tax rate. Convert the price of petrol, that is an effective tax rate of 230 per cent. This means that a person gets up in a home and she makes some sandwiches to save money because of the cost-of-living pressures. She is paying a 100 per cent tax rate on bread. She then walks out of her house, where she is paying a 100 per cent effective tax rate. And her petrol on the way to work, she fills up the car at a 230 per cent effective tax rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we see as the solution to everything the Greens come up with? Add another tax. It gets worse than that for housing affordability; because if half the cost of a house is tax, then that means the loan itself is double what it has to be. Think of the added interest when the loan is double what it has to be. Now you understand why housing is not affordable for young people. We can thank the Greens for that, because the Greens tax imposts are adding enormously to the cost of living. And we can thank the Greens, because due to their ridiculous policies they are raising the cost of energy and energy prices. That is decreasing employment and increasing costs. We must get back to basics and look at the whole tax system comprehensively.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  As I often do when I have the opportunity to speak in front of you, I regret to say that I have to acknowledge you as Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, but it is good to see your years of wisdom and experience being utilised in the chair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, I am not a particularly religious person, but today I am convinced that miracles do happen. Miracles happen because we have discovered for the second time that the Australian Greens have a tax that they do not like. I was delighted to discover earlier this year that the Greens, during the backpacker tax, discovered a tax they did not like. They campaigned vigorously against that. I was delighted to see that. I really appreciated the logic that the Greens brought to that debate and that aspect of tax. They realised that a tax on someone's employment might discourage people from being employed, and a tax on someone coming to work in Australia might discourage them from coming to work in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">It is wonderful to see that that solid economic logic from the Greens has been applied to a second area of policy. </span>They have realised that stamp duty, a tax applied to housing, makes housing more expensive and that perhaps this tax on housing is not a good thing and we should reduce it, if not get rid of it altogether. I hope the Greens apply this logic to other areas of tax policy. They might realise that, say, a tax on employment, in the form of a payroll tax, also discourages people from being employed and puts an extra cost on employment. They might realise that the tax on investment, the company tax, might reduce the amount of investment that takes place and that we should get rid of it if we want to see more investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope this is a sign of Senator Whish-Wilson's good economic influence on the Greens. I hope it continues. I look forward to seeing it play out in other areas of economic policy. But unfortunately it has not been quite consistent, even in this motion today. The Greens rightly recognise that stamp duty does make housing unaffordable and that we should get rid of that tax on housing. But at the same time they are arguing that we should in fact increase taxes on housing for some forms of people who would buy houses—in this case, investors. I am not sure how a tax on investment in housing is ever going to make housing more affordable. I will come to that in a minute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was one unfortunate aspect of the contribution from the Greens earlier in this debate today. We had to endure yet another tedious conspiracy theory from Senator Rhiannon about how donors to the coalition drive our policy on this issue. If every time the Greens got up and spoke about renewable energy one of us got up and said that their policy was being driven by the fact that renewable energy companies donate to the Greens, that would be very tedious. And I honestly do not believe that is true. I believe the Greens are genuinely committed to renewable energy, whatever the cost, as they have demonstrated. And I honestly believe that renewable energy companies donate to the Greens because of the Greens policy on renewable energy and not the reverse—that is, renewable energy companies do not dictate to the Greens what their policy on renewable energy should be. I wish they would apply that logic to others in this place and accept that we are sincere in advocating the positions we hold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very sincerely concerned about housing affordability because, more than most in this chamber, it affects my generation. As I have said before in these debates, my wife and I still rent at home in Melbourne. We do not yet own our own home. But no-one watching this at home need lose too much sleep over that. As I said, I am on a good salary as a senator and I will certainly be able to afford a good home when my wife and I are ready to purchase. But getting elected to the Senate is not a very good housing affordability strategy for most people in my generation—or it is certainly a very limited one. In fact, among all my peers and friends in my age group there is only one who has bought a home and is paying off a very big mortgage. So I absolutely understand the seriousness of this issue; it affects my generation more than any other. But we need to separate the issues that will address and actually fix the problems caused in this area from those that will not. Obsession over new taxes in this area is totally misplaced, totally unwise and will not solve the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will in due course see the government's plan in this area. I am really looking forward to the budget, where it has been widely flagged that there will be changes proposed to help improve housing affordability. It has been widely flagged that the emphasis will be on supply. I am pleased about that. Think about any other area of policy. If we decided that bread or milk were unaffordable, would we enact government policies to increase tax on those products or would we enact government policies to facilitate the extra supply of those products? It would certainly be the latter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to refer to one very valuable study in this area, an annual study which I think is the gold standard of policy analysis in this area. It is done by Demographia, an international group. They compare cities around the world for housing affordability. They released their latest study earlier this year—and there is an excellent article about this issue, by Leith van Onselen, published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Macro</span><span style="font-style:italic;">business</span> on 23 January this year. It goes through the cities that are unaffordable and have unaffordable housing. Unsurprisingly, cities like Hong Kong and Singapore have relatively unaffordable housing. You can see why that might be the case. They have a natural constraint on the supply of housing, so it is obvious that there is not much that those jurisdictions can do to increase supply. But it is unusual to see listed shortly after those countries Australia, which has no actual restrictions on the availability of land—and, therefore, housing—except the artificial ones we impose on ourselves. Regrettably, most of those restrictions are made at the local council and state government level. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The study shows one of the most important facts in this debate. Yes, the construction cost of housing is one issue that increases the unaffordability of housing. But fundamentally the source of expensive and unaffordable housing in this country is the value of the land that sits underneath that housing. It is the increase in land values that has primarily driven the increase in housing unaffordability. Why in Australia, one of the least densely populated countries in the world, would we have a shortage of land and a high land price? There is only one reason, and that is an artificial restriction on the supply of land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what those policies are. State governments have been loath to release sufficient quantities of land to allow people to build homes on them, and local councils have been loath to allow people to do on that land things which would allow them to supply more housing. We have these artificial constraints on housing driving up the costs of land and, as a result, housing is becoming more unaffordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the federal government is somewhat constrained in its capacity to deal with that because of the Constitution. I do not think anyone proposes to change that. All we can do is encourage states and local councils to provide an increased supply of land and allow people to do more on their land so that more houses can be built and that supply problem addressed. I hope that they do so, and I know that we will do whatever is within our power to assist that process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude on one final matter that was raised by Senator McAllister about the structure of the government's housing affordability policies and responsibilities. Last week I enjoyed, as I always do, attending the references committee hearing which she chaired and for which I was the deputy chair. It concerned the administrative arrangement orders of the government. In particular, I enjoyed the questions she asked and the interest she had in housing affordability. I am surprised though that Senator McAllister said she was confused by it. I know Senator McAllister is a very smart person and a very astute observer of the workings of government, and I did not think the answers we got from the public servants who appeared were confusing at all. I think it was incredibly straightforward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They said, as we know, that historically the Department of Social Services has had a significant area of responsibility in housing affordability, particularly the supply of housing to people in need, people who cannot afford to provide it themselves. That has always been the case. They also said that, as we know, the government has taken a wider interest in this issue and recognises that this is an issue primarily of supply. That is why my friend the member for Deakin, Michael Sukkar, was recently appointed as the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer to further assist in this area. It is a whole-of-government problem, particularly at the federal government level, because there are so many moving parts. It makes eminent good sense to me that we would appoint someone like Michael Sukkar to assist in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not sure where Senator McAllister's confusion comes from. I think it is abundantly clear. We will see on budget night the Treasurer announcing the fruits of the work that has been done between the Department of Social Services, under Christian Porter's leadership, and the Department of the Treasury, under Michael Sukkar's leadership. We will see that this government does have a plan to address this issue and will make best endeavours to make a positive contribution on this issue, recognising the fact that primarily the constraints in this area are about supply and they are primarily controlled by state and local governments. We urge them to do everything they can in their power to provide more land to reduce the price of housing and make it more affordable for my generation and generations to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I am pleased to engage in this matter of public importance discussion tonight and certainly to follow Senator Paterson, who used his own circumstances as an example. How dare someone from this place on a $200,000 base rate complain about housing affordability and still being able to only rent. If he gets re-elected time and time again, as we seem to see with the Liberals in Victoria, he will have a career that most people would be envious of—not his politics but the career he will have here earning plenty of money to look after his wife and family in the future. Unfortunately, that is not the position most people find themselves in. They can only dream about having a base rate of $200,000, such as Senator Paterson has.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We get an argument from One Nation and the coalition. They are joined at the hip on every issue now. On taking penalty rates away from workers they are joined at the hip. On this issue of housing affordability they are joined at the hip. Senator Hanson should just apply to rejoin the Liberal Party—that would close the circle—because really Senator Hanson does nothing more in here than vote with the Liberals. That is the position. They are always votes in this place that hurt working-class people in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument Senator Roberts has put up is simply about tax—there is too much tax. I wonder how people think we build edifices like this. Where does the money come from? Where does the money come from for health? Where does the money come from for education? Where does the money come from for infrastructure? It comes from taxes. When One Nation and the coalition are out there talking about small government and small taxes, working-class people need to understand that they are going to be in big trouble because they will not be able to get decent education, decent health, decent infrastructure and decent transport. These are the challenges. Housing is not a challenge in isolation. Housing is about being in a situation where you can access health, education, and transport to and from your job. Housing is not just simply about fixing high taxes and everything will be okay. If it were that simple, probably this neoliberal government would have done it. It is not that simple.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument that has been put forward again by Senator Paterson is that it really is a state issue, that we have got limited capacity, that there is an artificial constraint there—the artificial constraint being the Constitution—and that, if you fix supply and fix taxes, everything will be okay. Let us have a look at the record of the Abbott and Turnbull governments. The coalition government have been there for nearly four years and all of a sudden they have discovered housing affordability. There has been only one member of the coalition that I remember actually talking about housing affordability seriously and it is John Alexander in the other place. He has been arguing that capital gains tax and negative gearing have to be fixed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at this government's record. This is the mob who say: 'It's not our doing. We should just simply leave it alone.' When they came to power they refused to countenance any reform to negative gearing and capital gains tax simply because of ideological grounds, not because of any economic analysis or economic imperatives. It is simply: let the big end of town, rich people, get tax benefits paid for by poor people. That is the position over there, supported by Senator Hanson. So they refuse to deal with negative gearing and capital gains tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They closed the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which was one of the best schemes delivering good housing at reasonable cost across the country. There are 30,000 new affordable units and we were on track to achieve 50,000. That was the first increase in housing stock in this country for decades, and it was a Labor government that did it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They scrapped the first home saver account, which was helping people save for their first home. Senator Paterson came in here whinging about having to live in rented accommodation. I bet his rental accommodation is not like working-class people's rental accommodation. I bet it is nothing like that. I bet he is doing all right, and you would be with a $200,000 base wage. He came in here whingeing he cannot get a house. They cut $44 million a year from homelessness services. That is the other aspect of housing—homelessness. They failed to provide funding certainty under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. They drip-fed it. And good people out there, working hard to help homeless people, were unsure of whether they were going to have a job under this government. The government have just refused to appoint a dedicated minister for housing and homelessness. If they are actually serious about housing and homelessness, appoint a minister. Get a minister to be there to look at the issues and deal with the issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me come back to negative gearing and capital gains tax. It is not just Labor that is saying this. This morning, the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, Michael Sukkar, gave a speech that I was at. He again ruled out negative gearing reform. This was at a breakfast hosted by the Australian Institute of Architects. It went down like a lead balloon. The president of the Institute of Architects, Professor Ken Maher, got up and made his speech. He said that the tax treatment of property, including negative gearing, was clearly in need of reform. Add that to the line of experts who say that capital gains tax and negative gearing need to be dealt with. Add that to that list of eminent economists and eminent analysts in this country who say that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one is John Daley of the Grattan Institute. He says it is long overdue to change negative gearing and capital gains tax. He said it would save the Commonwealth government about $5.3 billion a year, Senator Hanson. Will One Nation support getting rid of negative gearing and capital gains tax and save the Commonwealth $5.3 billion a year? Then the institute say that the interaction of a 50 per cent capital gains tax with negative gearing distorts investment decisions. It makes housing markets more volatile and reduces home ownership. Senator Paterson wants to get into a house. He feels that he cannot get a house. He is in rental. The first thing he should do is support Labor to get rid of capital gains tax and negative gearing. It will then be easier for him to get a house. And with his $200,000 base salary, it would become even easier. The Grattan Institute say that if you do the two measures, not just negative gearing but also capital gains tax, if you get rid of them, it will reduce the cost to the public purse by $11.7 billion every year. They also go on to say that most of these tax concessions, these tax breaks, largely benefit the wealthy. That is where the money is going—to the wealthy. It is not like you hear in here that it is going to emergency service workers. The bulk of the money goes to the wealthy. That is where the money goes. Why should workers who are getting their penalty rates ripped away at the weekend by people like Senator Hanson be subsidising the wealthy in this country? So the message I have got for the Liberals and Senator Hanson is: fix capital gains tax and negative gearing. Make it fairer and maybe Senator Paterson might get a house to own one day. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I have heard so much hypocrisy from the other side of the house, from Senator Cameron, that I cannot believe it. He talks about getting rid of capital gains tax. Why wasn't it done in the period of time that the Labor Party were in government? No, they will not do it. So they whinge and complain when they are on the other side of this house, but they will not do it when they are in government because it does not work. Another part of the hypocrisy is when he talks about housing affordability. When foreign investors came into Australia and wanted to do a development they had to sell at least half of it to Australians. Guess what? Labor did away with that. The whole development could be sold to foreign investors. I am also told in relation to these big developments in Melbourne that 75 per cent of Melbourne city is owned by foreign investors. Forget about Australian ownership. Apart from that, do they pay stamp duty? What I have been told is that they only pay about $1,000 per apartment. So where is the money going? Out of the country, back to foreign investors. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The elephant in the room here—which no-one is taking any notice of—as to why housing affordability is out of the price range of ordinary Australians is immigration. You cannot continue to bring in huge numbers of migrants to Australia if you do not have the infrastructure—and housing is one. In this last financial year, we brought in 209,000 migrants and it is expected that in the next financial year there will be a further 226,000. We cannot provide housing for our own people here. We have 200,000 homeless people. We have rising costs of housing as well. The Greens are purporting to get rid of the— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If I could just reflect on Senator Hanson's contribution. Again, Senator Hanson, you hit the nail on the head. You focused on Labor's hypocrisy. Here we come, after just a few years, and Labor is quick to talk about the things that the coalition has not done, but Senator Hanson nailed it very succinctly by identifying Labor's hypocrisy on the issue of housing affordability.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SMITH:</span>
                  </a>  This afternoon, in the brief time that is available to me, let me just outline to you how my approach to tackling this issue. It is important that we get some expert opinion onto the public record with regard to the issue of housing affordability and, in particular, what it means for young people. So in a few moments I want to reflect on a recent contribution that the assistant governor of the RBA Luci Ellis made at a recent conference in Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that I think it is important—I am sure Senator Whish-Wilson will make some remarks in these respects—to consider those macro trends happening across the Australian economy that are affecting housing affordability. Senator Whish-Wilson, you can probably guess three of them, but let me help you: the population growth we have experienced, the interstate migration we are experiencing and, of course, those issues of supply which deal with land release and which deal with some of the poor construction activity we saw in decades past. I want to give people a degree of confidence that they can trust the Turnbull coalition government to tackle this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a familiar poor shot by Senator Cameron, who was again resorting to a personality attack, going after Senator Paterson's very honest and frank contribution. It was revealing that Senator Cameron did not seek to correct the record of the rumour that is circulating around this Senate. I do not know if you have heard it, Senator Whish-Wilson. It is that Senator Cameron, a senator for New South Wales, might soon find himself a senator for Tasmania. How else could you explain Senator Cameron's purchase of a $1.5 million property in Hobart? How else could you explain it unless the Labor senator for New South Wales was planning to be a Labor senator for Tasmania? Why else would he go and buy a $1.5 million property in Hobart? I have not heard that from Senator Cameron. Let me make that very clear: I have not heard it from Senator Cameron. If it is not true I am sure he will correct the record. I am sure if it is not $1.5 million he will tell us it is $1 million or $2 million. But it is up to Senator Cameron to correct the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is refreshing that we had the Australian Greens come into the Australian Senate this afternoon to talk about low taxes and about removing taxes. As Senator Paterson's contribution alluded, if they could do that across the broad brush of economic activity that would be a great advantage. We might even see a more credible Australian Greens if they could argue for reduced taxes and, by extension, reduced government spending across a whole variety of economic activity in the Australian economy. Of course, what we know is that what the Greens would like to take away with one tax cut they would like to improve with another tax hike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to reflect on an article of 25 November 2016. Senator Whish-Wilson, you probably know it well. It is Phillip Coorey's article about the Greens plan to introduce an inheritance tax. For all those people listening to the broadcast this afternoon, no matter where you live, you will not be untouched by the Greens inheritance tax. Let's just briefly share with those people listening to the broadcast what the Phil Coorey article said. It begins by saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Greens leader Richard Di Natale will up the ante on the taxation of investment property by recommending his party adopt as policy the imposition of death taxes on real estate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say, 'Senator Di Natale will flag imposing an "inheritance tax" on properties in which the owner was not the occupant.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the Phil Coorey article of November 2016 headed, 'Greens recommend death taxes for investors.' The article goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In his speech to the Greens national conference, Senator Di Natale will badge it as a measure to help address growing housing inequality. While he is realistic enough to accept the idea will not be readily embraced by the political mainstream—</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred per cent correct; well done!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">he will point out it was the Greens who first proposed—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">other tax cut arrangements with regard to housing issues. Then there is a quote from Senator Di Natale:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"I know this is a difficult issue but as a society, it's a conversation we have to have if we want to tackle the kind of soaring income inequality … "</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the danger. We have what is a very, very important and genuine concern in the community around the issue of housing availability and affordability, and then we have ideas been prosecuted by the Greens that are ill-conceived, ill-thought out and not consistent. They might, in actual fact, be the gateway for worse policies like inheritance taxes and death taxes. Just a suggestion, if I may, Senator Whish-Wilson: if the Greens want to establish a bit more credibility in the community, you might want to rule out things like death taxes and inheritance taxes, because they sure do send a shiver up the spines of ordinary Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want, in the time that is available to me, to reflect on the comments that were made by Luci Ellis, the assistant governor of the economic division at the Reserve Bank of Australia. She made these comments at the Australasian Housing Researchers Conference in February of this year. These are fresh reflections on the issue of housing affordability. These are reflections from an expert no less than the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Quoting from the Illawarra Mercury, let me just share what Luci Ellis had to say at that conference. Luci Ellis was reflecting on some of the issues that exist around housing affordability and the issue around housing supply, and made some very interesting observations about young people, which is an important element of the MPI we are dealing with this afternoon. The article says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While the proportion of 25 to 34 year olds owning the home they lived in had fallen from around 60 per cent to around 50 per cent since the 1970s, this wasn't necessarily a cause for concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then a quote from Luci Ellis:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Most of the decline happened by the early 1990s, before the big increase in housing prices relative to incomes," she said. "What changed during that earlier period was that people started partnering and settling down later in life."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ownership rates for young people declined partly because "many people wait to settle down before they buy a home".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"By saying this, I am not suggesting that people should not worry about whether households can achieve their desired housing tenure," she said. "I am suggesting that the situation is more complex than would be suggested by a single-minded focus on a single metric of affordability such as median housing prices."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, Luci Ellis, the Assistant Governor of the RBA, is making a very important point: these issues happen in the context of broader demographic changes—those that we are living through and those that might have happened prior to us coming to this party. I think she makes a very interesting point where she starts to discuss what I think is a critical issue, and that is the issue around loan-to-valuation ratios. In that regard, as reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span>, Luci Ellis says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So it's surprising that as housing prices have risen, the loan-to-valuation ratio hasn't shifted up over time. One reason might be that more borrowers are getting help from friends and family to accumulate the deposit. Careful analysis of data shows that the share of first home buyers receiving that help has been increasing over the decades, but actually remains low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In researching for this contribution this afternoon, I think the comments that Luci Ellis made at the Australasian Housing Researchers Conference in Melbourne on 16 February 2017 are very enlightening. We cannot hide from the fact that this issue is not immune from the broader demographic trends that are happening across our community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  I am not quite sure where Senator Smith is going with his analysis in recognising that we have a housing affordability crisis in this country and that they are going to be tackling it in this year's budget. I will wait with bated breath to see what package of policies and incentives the government is going to put forward. This is an issue that is taken very seriously by the Greens. This is an issue that we continually raise in estimates with the Treasury secretary, in committee work and in this place. We will always stand up for young Australians—we have generational inequality that needs to change in this country—and for low-income Australians, the battlers who want to try and get ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have a problem with housing in this country. Depending on where you live, we have a very big problem in some places. We have the dubious honour of spending the highest proportion of income on housing in the world. As Senator McAllister said earlier, we have the highest household debts in the wold. The proportion of young people who own their own home, particularly in certain areas of Australia, is in decline and is now at the lowest level in 60 years. It is easy to see why. It is because housing prices continue to go through the roof, inequality is being created on a generational scale, the economy is being distorted because of perverse incentives that the government refuses to change and the financial system is being loaded with risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's housing market is being driven by a tax system that favours investors over owner-occupiers. The Treasurer went to the UK over Christmas, apparently to sit on committees and collect information on housing affordability. That was great. We are looking forward to the new ideas. But what he should have done was come home via Africa and go on a safari—because there are some big elephants that the Treasurer cannot see in the Treasury and in his own party room. Those policy elephants are negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. The capital gains tax discount is the sixth largest tax expenditure in this country and cost us $6.8 billion in 2016-17. It goes mostly to the wealthy, with 73 per cent of the benefit flowing to the top 10 per cent of income earners. Negative gearing costs us nearly $4 billion a year, and over half the benefits go to the top 20 per cent of households in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no reason why wealthy Australians who generate income from investments such as property should be taxed at different rates than everyone else. The Reserve Bank is among an overwhelming number of groups pushing for reform for these tax breaks. We have figures from the Parliamentary Library around negative gains and capital gains discounts. On average, investors are receiving benefits of $4,500 a year. But this rises to $9,200 per household in the highest income quartiles. And guess what, Senator Cameron? The top 10 negative-gearing electorates are all Liberal electorates when you look at the data. The Prime Minister and his wife themselves own nine properties between them, including five investment properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Senator Hanson bothered looking at the data, she would not come in here blaming immigration and migrants in this country, people who flee to Australia from persecution, people whom we should be helping, for the housing crisis in this country. What a ridiculous notion. How many houses do they own? They would be lucky if they own a single house, Senator Macdonald. Most of them are in public housing or on waiting lists or have been put up by their communities in places like Launceston—where I live—by church groups and other community groups who look after them. They do not own nine properties!</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have over the years wanted to get rid of capital gains tax concessions and negative gearing. We have recently put forward a very good proposal for swapping stamp duty for land taxes. We are happy to push the boundaries on housing reform and we are happy to lead the national debate in this area. We put forward an innovative way for the federal government to assist the states to transition from the worst form of tax, stamp duty, which is a tax on transactions—even Senator Paterson agrees with that—to the best form, which is a broad based land tax. Almost every economist and housing industry group in the country agrees that this reform needs to happen. But no-one has suggested it yet, because they are worried about political campaigns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not saying that this whole debate is not complex and complicated; it is, and we have to look at it in a very holistic manner. But this particular proposal, putting forward a broad based stamp duty reduction or scrapping stamp duty and replacing it with a land tax, will do four important things. It would reduce the cost of buying a house for young and low-income Australians and free up those cherished family homes for new homeowners—because stamp duty stops older Australians from resizing to more appropriate housing. Public infrastructure investment by governments would be recaptured. Senator Paterson says, 'Why don't we just release more supply?' What are the reasons we do not release more supply? We do not have proper government investment in infrastructure in outer suburbs and in rural and regional communities in this country. On housing affordability, the best way to solve that crisis on the supply side is investing in productive, long-term infrastructure such as public transport. Where property values increase because they are close to public transport, land tax collections will rise, and that is smart, and that is money we can use for schools and hospitals. It will improve rental supply and rental housing standards for tenants. Investors speculating and sitting on underutilised and vacant properties would decrease, which of course is very important, because a lot of supply, as Senator Paterson refuses to mention, is actually hoarded. It is sat on and not made available for rent and for providing a fix for the housing affordability crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are happy to provide details to senators in this chamber and to have this debate here today, because that is exactly what we should be doing in the Senate: we should be getting on with brave reform and helping young and low-income Australians tackle the housing affordability crisis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to speak today on the Auditor-General's report No. 43 of 2016–17, <span style="font-style:italic;">Performance audit: proceeds of crime</span>. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 is a very interesting piece of legislation, and I thought that today I would just put on the record a little bit of the history of how this came about and reflect on the findings of the ANAO. The initial legislative confiscation scheme was established by the Commonwealth in the middle of the 1980s, and it arose out of the 1983 Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. I think we need to keep mindful of the origins of this particular piece of legislation, because it was intimately connected with drugs. I know that drug trafficking and the concerns about drug use in our community—poly drug use and particularly ice—are very prevalent right now. They should be at the front of our minds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the 1980s, there have been a range of confiscation schemes, and they have been amended in a number of ways. I think it is quite instructive to have a look at the report here. The ANAO were generally pretty positive in their response to this, but they did put on the record some facts that I think are worth putting out into public conversation. If, on the balance of probabilities, a person has committed a serious offence and property is considered to be the proceeds or the instrument of an offence, the property can be taken from the person who has received it through the benefits of criminal activity. In 2015-16, property with an estimated recovery value of $57.4 million was forfeited, and there are a number of ways in which this can be acquired. In 2015-16, $59.7 million was transferred into the Confiscated Assets Account, and at July 2016 the balance of the account was $112.6 million. That is no small amount. When I think about what this is supposed to do and what $112.6 million could do, I have some serious questions I would like to put on the record today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General's Department gives advice to the Minister for Justice on how to spend these confiscated assets and funds, and it is prescribed by section 298 of the Proceeds of Crime Act that there are four ways in which they should be expended:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I found reading that little part of the report very interesting, because, when you look at the way in which the funds have been expended by this government since its acquisition of power in 2013, it looks like most of the money is going to crime prevention measures and law enforcement measures and not to measures relating to the treatment of drug addiction or diversionary measures relating to illegal use of drugs. While that did not cause any particular concern for the ANAO in terms of how the money is being gathered, held and reported, I think it raises serious questions about the focus of this government in responding to the reality of great need right across the country in regions and in cities for access to drug rehabilitation and to the preventative capacity that communities need.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very instructive to see that, of the significant expenditure, $51.3 million went to the Australian Federal Police and $28.9 million to the Australian Crime Commission. The New South Wales police got $12 million and the Victorian police $8.4 million—there were no other states; I thought that was pretty interesting—and money went to a number of other entities that were about crime management. Youth Off the Streets was the only program that I could see that got a significant amount of money which was for intervention outreach, but I could not see, among the non-government, community organisation and local council funding pool, any recipients of funds that were directed at encouraging people into treatment or providing treatment options. I think that that is something that needs to be pursued. That being said, the ANAO did indicate that there was room for improvement in the investment of these funds to try and maximise the value of this fund going forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of the committee in assessing bills against its scrutiny principles assists and improves parliamentary consideration of legislation in a number of important ways. Outcomes of the committee's work include:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">and more informed debate in the Senate and committees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's 2016 annual report outlines some of the key achievements of the committee's work last year. One clear example of the impact of the committee's work is amendments to bills and revisions to explanatory material as a direct result of the committee scrutiny. For example, in 2016, as part of its regular scrutiny of legislation, the committee sought advice about the privacy implications of the new National Cancer Screening Register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this scrutiny, amendments were made to remove a provision that would have allowed additional bodies to be prescribed by delegated legislation to collect and use protected medical information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, based on a suggestion by the committee, an amendment was moved to ensure that the Privacy Commissioner is consulted prior to the making of rules which would allow further classes of medical information to be included on the register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's comments were also referenced in debates in the Senate and in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee's report on the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to such quantifiable outcomes of the committee's work, I take this opportunity to highlight the impact of the committee's work prior to the introduction of bills into the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems clear that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has an 'unseen influence' on the development of bills through the legislative drafting process. Legislative drafters and officials are aware of the reports of the committee, and therefore many provisions that may have been of concern to the committee may not be included in the final text of bills that come before the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Underpinning this 'unseen influence' is formal guidance available to agencies and departments as part of the legislative drafting process. Departmental documents such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Legislation Handbook</span>, the Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences and the OPC Drafting Directions all draw attention to the committee's longstanding scrutiny concerns, helping to ensure that these concerns are considered before the bill gets to parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, in 2016 the Office of Parliamentary Counsel revised its drafting directions relating to the use of subordinate instruments and the use of standing appropriations, and in so doing drew attention to the committee's scrutiny concerns on these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">New developments in 2016</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The annual report also highlights some new developments for the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, in 2016 the Senate voted to temporarily amend the standing orders regarding responsiveness to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. As senators know, the committee works to ensure, wherever possible, that its comments on bills are available to senators prior to the passage of the bill. As such, where the committee writes to a minister it expects a response to be received in time to be considered by the committee and reported on while the bill is still before the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is essential to an effective scrutiny process. Yet, while most ministers and departments work hard to provide timely responses to the committee, the annual report notes that, in 2016, 44 per cent of responses to the committee were not received on time. This demonstrates the importance of the temporary amendment to the standing orders, which allows any senator to question a minister about why they have not provided a timely response to the committee's request for information. This amendment began to operate earlier this year, and the committee will provide further information about its implementation and operation in the committee's next annual report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, at the end of 2016 the committee resolved that from 2017 it would table just one document, known as the Scrutiny Digest, to replace the committee's Alert Digest and Report. The committee secretariat has already received positive feedback in relation to this move to a single reporting format.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work and assistance of the committee's legal adviser, Associate Professor Leighton McDonald.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge the assistance of ministers and departments, as their responsiveness to the committee is crucial to the legislative scrutiny process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting the committee's longstanding practice of undertaking its scrutiny in a non-partisan and consensual way, I also thank all of my current and former scrutiny committee colleagues for their understanding of the committee's approach to its work and their commitment to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to note because it is touched on many times in this chamber about the work of our secretariats for our committees. There are enormous pressures and workloads placed on each and every one of our committees. The secretariats who work to ensure that we have the highest quality reports cannot ever be underestimated the importance that places and assists the democracy of this country. I would like to acknowledge the secretariat that worked with us for their attentiveness, their energy and their drive to ensure that we scrutinise the legislation so that we can add to the process here in this chamber. I commend the committee's 2016 annual report to the Senate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Manchurian Candidate</span> is a story about a cunning foreign power pulling the strings in domestic political affairs. It is a work of fiction, but it seems a lot of people think it was a documentary. They imagine foreign bad guys seeking to control Australian politics, and they cast themselves as the hero stamping out the foreign threat with a patriotic flurry of regulation. The truth is a whole lot more boring and is not the stuff of a Hollywood movie. Regulating just because something sounds bad, without knowing whether it is, is wrong. A ban on foreign donations is a solution in search of a problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a participating member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I heard the evidence it received in relation to foreign donations. Various people and organisations argued in favour of prohibiting foreign donations, but none against it. However, several urged considerable caution—including the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. This is interesting, as the leaders of both parties have declared their opposition to foreign donations. What is significant is that both parties were keen to warn against doing more harm than good. Among the points they raised were the following. How should a foreign donation be defined? Is it a donation from a foreign entity? That is, a person or organisation that is not Australian. What about permanent residents or dual citizens? What about domestic branches of foreign entities, such as international environmental groups or businesses? Then there is compliance. How could a party, particularly an Independent candidate or minor party, possibly know whether a donor is an Australian citizen or company? And what about an Aussie who sources funds from overseas before donating them to an Australian political party?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another option was to define a foreign donation as one from a foreign source—in other words, a bank account not in Australia. There are problems with that too. Expatriate Australians who would like to donate to a political party but have not retained a domestic bank account while living overseas might be affected for example. Some argued that only voters on the electoral roll should be permitted to donate. That is the approach taken by the New South Wales government. The High Court decided it was unconstitutional, declaring that democracy involves more than just voters. New South Wales still has the most stringent laws on political donations in the country, and they are a compliance nightmare, as the Liberal Party submission noted. And yet, is New South Wales the least corrupt jurisdiction in the country? Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald might be the only ones to say so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that foreign donations are insignificant. To the extent there is any data at all, it shows that foreign donations typically amount to only about one per cent of all the funds Australian political parties receive. And that data shows it is not increasing. The bulk of political funding comes from taxpayers, not donations. But rather than deal with this realistic story, we get foreign bogey men, and patriotic regulation to stop them in their tracks. The truth is that the committee heard no evidence that would support specific prohibition of foreign donations. It heard no evidence to validate the claim that there was any significant community concern about foreign donations. Senator Dastyari's use of a foreign source to pay a private bill is not about foreign donations to political parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if there was widespread community concern about foreign donors exerting influence, imagining mischief does not make it a reality. Not a single instance of a foreign player using donations to influence domestic policy was heard. No witness outlined how foreign donations could influence domestic policy. No reasoning was provided to suggest that foreign donations could be problematic in the future, where they have not been in the past. No witness was able to indicate how a substantial foreign donation may have a detrimental effect on Australia's democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were assertions that major domestic donors secure privileged access to senior members of the government, but no-one could point to specific benefits that a donor might receive. There was zero mention of why this is relevant to minor parties and others, which are never likely to form government. The committee did not explore the distinction between a foreigner donating to a party so as to amplify the party's longstanding and strongly held policies, and a foreigner donating to a party in an attempt to change the party's policies. The former motivation may be the predominant one, and may be of little concern to the Australian community. Many Australians care about American politics, and may consider it acceptable to have donated to either the Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump campaigns. If this is the case, they may also consider it acceptable for a foreigner to take a similar, arms-length interest in Australian politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some witnesses raised concerns about donations by foreign governments. This could be countered by specifically banning donations from foreign governments, although a foreign government could still funnel donations via private entities. And what exactly are we trying to stop?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee was informed by International IDEA, a group that monitors political transparency issues internationally, that many countries restrict or prohibit foreign donations. And yet that group acknowledged that there is a lack of correlation between political corruption and the regulation of foreign donations. In other words, the evidence does not show that restricting foreign donations reduces corruption, which raises the question: why bother?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of those seeking to prohibit political donations prefer public funding of political parties. Support for increased public funding is inherent in arguments to restrict avenues for private donations. However, the committee heard neither a theoretical argument for suggesting that democracy is enhanced by public funding nor empirical evidence confirming that such an outcome is achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a further aspect to consider, and that is whether bans on foreign donations should also apply to others seeking to influence electoral outcomes. Should businesses, industry bodies, unions, charities, universities and social issues groups—but not political parties—be able to campaign for particular electoral outcomes with the assistance of foreign donations? In the USA, donations to political parties are strictly controlled, while those to third parties are not; hence the growth of political action committees, or PACs. Is that what we want?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a better way. Donations, domestic or foreign, only matter if they have an impact on democracy. Since this is determined by voters, all that is needed is for voters to be aware of donations before they vote so they can take them into account when deciding how to vote. If voters are indifferent to donations, either in general or in a particular case, voting outcomes will not be affected and the fact of the donation is irrelevant. If voters disapprove of any particular source or type of donation, they can take this into account when they vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is remarkably patronising and reflects nanny-state thinking for governments to assume that voters are incapable of deciding for themselves whether a recipient of a donation deserves their support. It is also inherently antidemocratic. If voters are assumed to lack the competence to form a judgement about donations, it follows that they must also lack the competence to form a judgement about party policies generally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Democracy simply requires voters to be adequately informed. Disclosure of donations should occur at an appropriate time so voters can take it into account when casting their vote. The only regulation needed for this is to prohibit donations made so close to the election that they cannot be disclosed in time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I also want to say just a few words on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second interim report on the inquiry into the conduct of the 2016 federal election: foreign donations</span>, by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and the recommendation that Senator Leyonhjelm has just been talking about. The committee, as I recall, has recommended that foreign donations to political parties, to associated entities and to third parties who take part in election campaigns should be prohibited, or words to that effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to note, however, that, whilst the majority report made this recommendation, there was a dissenting report by the Labor Party and the Greens to effectively ban foreign donations to political parties but not to the unions or to third parties—namely, conservation groups or GetUp! So, whilst it was inappropriate, according to the Labor Party, to have donations to political parties from foreign sources, it was okay for foreign sources to donate substantial money to the unions, to the conservation groups and to GetUp!, all of whom directly or indirectly support the Labor Party or the Greens political party. What a surprise that the Labor Party and the Greens, in a dissenting report, would oppose that!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would love to have someone just explain to me why, if foreign donations are inappropriate for the major political parties, they are okay for the third-party groups that support the Greens and the Australian Labor Party. You see, the Australian Labor Party does not these days put much money into election campaigns; it all comes from the unions. Some of it comes from members' funds; some of it comes from sources we do not know. They could be foreign; they could be elsewhere. GetUp!, who support the Greens political party and the Labor Party indirectly through the Greens political party, get huge donations from overseas—and this is all on the record—and that is okay, apparently, according to the Greens and the Labor Party. That is okay, but, if someone wants to donate to the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, that is not possible.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, these days, the Labor Party are not the main campaign arm and certainly not the main campaign funders for the Labor Party in any election. Those are the unions. That brings to mind, of course, the commitment by the Queensland Labor Party—so they say in this chamber—to put One Nation last. I will believe that when I see it in their preference allocation. But of course, whilst the Labor Party might do that, the unions, who are the main campaigners and the main funders for the Labor Party in the Queensland election, will not be putting One Nation last; they will do what they have done in the last few elections. They will have signs, and campaign loudly and strongly—and belligerently, I might say—to put the LNP last. The Labor Party senators here say, 'No, that is not going to happen. The Labor Party is going to put One Nation last.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Moore, I notice you are in the chamber. You are a Queensland senator. You might use this opportunity to get up and assure the Queensland voting public that not only will the Labor Party put One Nation last but your principal campaigners, the people who fund you—that is, the unions—will also follow suit. Because I will bet you that you cannot say that, and that when we have the state election in Queensland you will find the major Labor Party campaign, funded by the unions, will be saying, 'Put the LNP last.' If I am wrong, I would love you, Senator Moore, or one of your Queensland colleagues, to get up and say, 'No, not only will the Labor Party be putting One Nation last but so will our main campaign arm,' which these days are the unions. </span>

                    </a>  Southerners, indeed, yes. But they were not locals. They were on the local polling booths. LNP polling booths were being manned by volunteers, local volunteers, from Townsville. But who was manning the Labor Party booths and, I might say, then Senator Lazarus's booth? It was the CFMEU, the CPSU and, in Lazarus's case, the MUA. They were all there. They were all being paid. They were not there as volunteers, like the LNP supporters. They were all there supporting the Labor Party, with campaign slogans that said 'Put the LNP last'—not 'Put One Nation last', put the anti-immigration parties last, put other parties, even Palmer's party, last, but 'Put the LNP last'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really look forward to any Labor Party person with any semblance of standing in that organisation coming in here and assuring me that not only the Labor Party will not be preferencing One Nation before the LNP but the unions will not be preferencing One Nation before the LNP. If the Labor Party want to preference One Nation, that is fine. I do not care. There is nothing wrong with One Nation, if the Labor Party want to preference them. It is about the dishonesty of the Labor Party saying, 'We are putting One Nation last because we do not like them,' and getting up in the chamber here and hurling some abusive, unparliamentary comments at Senator Hanson and her colleagues—unnecessary, but that is what the Labor Party do—and saying they are totally opposed to One Nation, but, come the Queensland election, I will bet you any money you like that the unions who support and run the campaign for the Labor Party will have signs saying, 'Put the LNP last,' which means, by implication, that the Labor Party will be preferencing One Nation before the LNP. If I am wrong, I would love someone of standing in the Labor Party in Queensland to come in and tell me I am wrong—that not only will they be putting One Nation last but the unions will be as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, I have nothing against One Nation in particular. They are not the best political party. The best one, of course, is the LNP in Queensland. There is no doubt about that. But I just cannot control my mirth at the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. In spite of all their abuse of One Nation—inappropriate abuse, more often than not—you will find that, at the Queensland state election, the Labor Party in Queensland will be preferencing One Nation over the LNP. One might ask, 'What about their honesty, what about their commitments, what about their integrity?' Well, we will see at that time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to be able to put on the record a response to the government's response to the committee inquiry into the 2016 census debacle. The report is entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">2016 Census: issues of trust</span>. It goes to core issues about the trust that the Australian people no longer have in this government, which is not only out of touch but also out of common sense in making sure that adequate resources are allocated to critical parts of governance. The census, I think, is a perfect example of a total failure by a government that thinks that cutting funding to everything will somehow make Australia better. We see it in so many policy areas. The device of the census is so important to figuring out the needs of the country, and to good planning and good governance. But, instead of the government investing in that properly, we saw a shameful abrogation of responsibility over the five years preparation for it. It started off all right, but it really got pretty wobbly after 2013.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am keen to indicate, in general, that the report offered to the government for its consideration made 16 recommendations. This government noted six of them. For those who do not read too many reports and who are not in the position of responding to them, 'noted' simply means, 'Yes, we hear what you are saying, but we are not going to do anything about it.' Three of the 16 recommendations—around, what I think was, one of the biggest debacles to reach every family across the country—were not agreed to at all, seven were happily agreed to by the government and one was agreed to only in principle. That is a pretty poor response from the government to this serious set of recommendations that was made by the Economics References Committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw attention to information that was garnered by the committee with regard to budget problems and suspended preparations. There was a submission by IBM to the inquiry that informed the committee's development. In the submission, IBM said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In … February 2015, the ABS informed IBM that it was considering not proceeding with the 2016 eCensus (or, indeed, any Census in 2016). IBM understands that the ABS was considering decreasing the frequency of the Census to once every 10 years and running a rolling Australian Population Survey … during the intercensal period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This kind of tinkering that the government has decided to undertake with this critical information shows a lack of respect for the important information that is gathered in the census. The census preparations not only were complicated by this partial indication by the government that it was walking away from the census but were further complicated by the departure of the Australian Statistician, Brian Pink<span style="font-weight:bold;">.</span> That happened in January 2014, and his permanent replacement was not appointed until a year later, in December 2014. Mr David Kalisch's appointment delay, in that critical period of time, clearly had an impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that during the period from September 2013 through to August 2016 the government had four different ministers take responsibility for the census—or take no responsibility for the census might be a better way to describe it. We had the Hon. Steve Ciobo MP, the Hon. Alex Hawke MP, the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer MP and, finally, the Hon. Michael McCormack MP. You have to have a bit of compassion for the Hon. Michael McCormack, the member for Riverina, because he just got landed with it at the end after the others had all ignored it and failed for a very long time. I know that the constant moving around of responsibilities and people that we have seen within the government is a very significant problem. We are on to our third health minister. Nobody is actually dedicated to doing the hard work that is involved in the good governance of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go to a couple of the recommendations that the government has only agreed to in principle or has not agreed to. Recommendation 3 goes to the heart of the issue that concerns Australians about the integrity of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the collection of the census data. Recommendation 3 from the committee said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that the ABS publicly commit to reporting any breach of census related data to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner within one week of becoming aware of the breach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That seems eminently sensible, like the other 15 recommendations of the reference committee. Unfortunately, this was only agreed to in principle. It is basically a wave and a nod saying, 'Well, maybe.' The qualifier the government has come up with, after everybody has gone through what they have gone through with the census debacle, with concerns about data safety and management, and with so many other failures of technology that they have presided over, is this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Privacy incidents that are identified, and are considered in scope of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner's (OAIC) guidelines for the notification of data breaches, are reported by the ABS as soon as practicable to the OAIC. In some cases, it may not be possible to assess a potential breach within one week of identification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is just not good enough. It shows a failure to understand the importance of investing in systems and processes that meet those standards. I think Australians would agree that, if there has been a breach of important data that is related to them, a week is quite a long period of time these days for them to be identified and notified. Certainly, that accountability should be much higher in line with the recommendations by the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of recommendations that were not agreed, I will go to that later recommendations in the report. Recommendation 16, recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that the responsible minister act as a matter of urgency to assist the ABS in filling senior positions left vacant for greater than 6 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the failure to have adequate leadership at the head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics had a very negative impact. Their response was: it is not their role, except in the appointment of the Australian Statistician. That they did such a slow and terrible job with that reveals again a lack of care and a lack of interest in doing the work that needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important recommendation that was noted, was: 'The minister should seek six-monthly briefings on the progress of census preparations.' That seems a sensible recommendation, given how badly they failed and the fact that they had so many ministers take responsibility. If these six monthly briefings had been happening we might have been able to get to the heart of the problem: the fact that IBM did not have the capacity to do the job on 9 August. We would have got there if we had had better briefings. The sad thing is that this recommendation has only been 'noted'. It is not 'for action', not 'agreed'—no responsibility accepted for this significant failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the report the committee, at the end of chapter 6 entitled 'The conduct of the 2016 census', made these claims:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Criticisms made with the benefit of hindsight must necessarily be tempered, but there appears to have been significant and obvious oversights in the preparation of the eCensus. IBM's failure to have tested a router restart, or have a backup synchronised and in place, appears to have been significant contributing factors to the failure of the eCensus on 9 August.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite that sort of a comment in the report and concerns that were raised in chapter 7, 'Census 2016: the morning after', which reported submissions to the committee from groups as diverse as the Executive Council of Australian Jewry—the council expressed the concern of many census users when they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a community, we are very concerned at the possibility that the events leading up to, during and following census night might have a detrimental effect on the quality of the 2016 Census data, potentially impacting negatively on our ability to plan for current and future service provision and need in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen throughout the day a complete disregard for good government practice, and we see it again in the response to this important report from the Senate Economics References Committee—that is, a failure to adequately take into account the recommendations of the committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, the findings of our interim report should be of great concern to the chamber. We make findings that call on the Senate to take action, and I can outline why. We have been unable to table a substantive report according to the time line, and that is because Senator Brandis, as he has shown in this chamber time and time again, has not only refused to answer the questions put to him, but also, more to the point, he has obfuscated and refused to allow public servants to also answer questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know about the issue is based on the evidence that has been provided by the Australian Taxation Office. It is clear that the Commonwealth is entitled to significant funds from the Bell liquidation—in the order of at least several hundred million dollars. In taking the committee evidence, we have sought to work through and to understand the extent to which the Commonwealth was involved in conversations to subvert the money that the ATO has a right to by supporting a deal with the previous state government in Western Australia to subvert the order of funds by passing legislation through their parliament. We know there have been allegations that the Attorney-General was involved in the potential issuing of a direction to prevent the Commonwealth from intervening, so therefore taking the side of the state government, and putting at risk those funds that the ATO should have a right to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have put many questions to Senator Brandis and to government officials, of which a vastly overwhelming number have not been answered. I can highlight for the Senate today some of the exchanges that took place between Senator Brandis and me. For example:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CHAIR: There were some 30 questions taken on notice that the department did not answer on 17 February, so the committee is asking if you can provide the answers from the department or, alternatively … specify the harm to the public interest that would arise from answering the questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The due date for answering those questions was some time ago. Senator Brandis told the committee hearing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I am sure that can be done.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I will ensure that the questions are answered, and those answers, of course, may include any appropriate claims of immunity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from the committee <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> from our hearing on 8 March. There were many similar exchanges in the committee. What happened is that the deadline passed for the submission of questions on notice and no answers were forthcoming. This has put the committee in a very difficult position in terms of its accountability to this chamber in meeting the demands of our terms of reference to ascertain the facts in relation to the Bell matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Senator Brandis has nothing to hide, then it should be a simple process for him to answer those questions. I am quite certain that the department prepared answers to our questions and provided them to him to examine. He could have considered which of those he would like to mount a public interest immunity claim for. Senator Brandis set about simply claiming legal professional privilege, as did the department. Legal professional privilege is not an accepted public interest immunity ground in and of itself. The specific harm that comes from the disclosure of information must be specified in making a public interest immunity claim. Not only has the committee received no answers but it has also received no justification that would demonstrate any reason to not have provided those answers.</span>

But if they wish to leave the minister an option of making a public interest immunity claim then public servants, in answering questions, are free to do that.

The Labor Party have taken all the time so that I will be prevented from saying anything. That is typical of the way this committee is run.

This is a farcical inquiry, this is a farcical report, and the whole process of this committee is an absolute farce and an embarrassment to the Senate. It brings the whole Senate committee process into disrepute. There has not been a shred of evidence to support anything in this report. The Attorney-General has been found to be blameless. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  We seem to be going through the same process we did earlier today. When I was speaking earlier, I talked about the process that the community affairs committee has had to consider the various iterations of these issues that are in front of us in this new bill. As I was saying, it is really important, and I value the fact, that governments actually listen to the evidence that is brought forward in submissions and public hearings. And it is worthy that governments take up some of the issues that have been brought in through that process. It does not always happen. But in this case, belatedly, this morning—I am not quite sure what time but it was sometime before 9.30—the government did take up one of the core recommendations that people had made during the hearing quite recently, which was to separate into two bills the proposed bill put before the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistently, submissions and evidence that came to us talked about the division that the previous bill had caused. It fact, it had divided people who would be subject to loss through this bill through budget savings. I will go through that later, and many senators will talk about the most vulnerable people subject to cuts. It set up a division between people who would be losing entitlement and losing some process through this bill. And it put that in direct contrast with the child-care package, for which the community had been waiting for many years. There was a clear division created, seemingly a conflict, which was expressed by many of our witnesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way the government had presented the omnibus bill, the statements by ministers, and speeches in the other place and in the media all told the community that, unless we were prepared as a parliament and a community to accept the budget cuts—some of which had been around since 2014—the child-care package would not be funded. It was clearly, 'Take it or leave it.' My understanding is that that rhetoric continued certainly until this morning's media. There was no clear understanding that there would be a decision from the government to present two separate bills into this place, but they did. There was a little bit of a problem in that we did not have a copy of the new bills when we came in early this morning. I believe that was expressed earlier by Senator Siewert.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, Senator Siewert has been involved in every single committee hearing in this place on the cuts since 2014. No-one knows this process better than she does and no-one is across the detail of the legislation more than she is, but this morning she was unaware of exactly what the new bills would look like. I do not think that is an effective process. We can disagree on the content and the policy, but what about the process? There are regular negotiations all the time in this place trying to get the magic number to get a bill passed. All of us know the protocol of that. We all know how it works. We often wait for bills to come on. They move up and down the red. We can see what is going to be debated at what time. If something pops up, we think, 'The deal has been done.' That is how this place operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am unaware of a previous process like this morning's. The bill was not only divided. It was not just, 'Here is the bill that the Senate committee looked at only a couple of weeks ago'—and I think we brought down our report only yesterday—'Here is the original bill and what we are going to do now is split it.' All the work had been done and the evidence had been given. They were not just going to split the bill and take out a key element, no. We found out that the savings measures in the bill, which are in the legislation that is in front of us in this debate, are not the same as those we debated only last week in the committee. There have been changes. I am not arguing about the changes, as some of the elements of the bill to which I had the most objection are not in this new bill, so that is a good thing. However, we did not know that when we were preparing our arguments to consider this important piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is such an important piece of legislation that we are now going to be confined in the parliament to listen to a series of deeply-important speeches that will be passionately made about this issue and, if they are not concluded by midnight tonight, we will come back and be here until midnight tomorrow night and then we will be here on Friday. Senator O'Sullivan spoke loudly across the chamber this morning and in his wisdom suggested that, if we did not get our act together—and I took that as personal; I think it was 'our act together'—we could sit on Saturday and Sunday as well. My understanding is that Saturday and Sunday are not in the current hours resolution, but certainly the intent of the government this morning was that we stay until these two bills, which are the two bills from the previous omnibus bill, are concluded. We are going to continue staying in here until they are concluded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the government considers that these bills are so important that we had to have a special hours resolution to ensure we behave and stay in this place. Secondly, we did not see a full copy of the new legislation until after the hours motion had been put. Thirdly, when we started the debate we were not even clear on what is in the legislation. That is not how you get sensible debate. You may get an outcome—and certainly we understand that a deal has been done. It is pretty clear after this morning's series of divisions what those numbers might be. That is not a reflection of the best arrangement in terms of looking at the issues and how the debate should be handled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I get back to the bill in front of us. In the savings bill, the part that looks at social services, are a series of cuts that we have considered many times. In fact, when we had the omnibus bill hearing a couple of weeks ago I could not remember how many times we had considered some of these proposals. But every time we have considered them the evidence before us has been that the community reject them. In terms of the priority that has been decided by the government about where they will place their key savings measures, what has come before us consistently, via a range of community and specialist evidence, is a rejection that this is the priority for the savings. We have identified and heard that the cuts to family tax benefit parts A and B, the income-free areas for working age and student payments, and the ordinary waiting periods—issues with which we have become very familiar because they have come before us in a number of pieces of legislation—will focus on the most vulnerable people in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current family tax benefit regime has been around for many years. In my previous work in the Department of Social Security and in my work since I have been elected to this place there has been cross-party support for family tax payments. They are social welfare payments. Both the major parties and the crossbenchers, in terms of the Greens and other people, have seen the motivation and background for the family tax payments. Whilst it is very important that they are effectively targeted—and there have been debates in this place over many years about how we most effectively and most efficiently target these payments—the core element is that we look at the people who rely most on these payments to ensure that their families are safe, are well looked after and have a reasonable expectation of a quality of life that will ensure that children in particular are well cared for. That is the background of family tax payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen in the last few rounds of cuts that have come through this place under budget measures has been a targeted attack on the quality and the quantity of family tax payments. What is before us again in this bill tonight is a further reduction in the family tax payment process. If only people could take the time to look at the evidence that has come before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee from people who work in this field as part of their job, as part of their life choices, and who identify exactly what the impact will be from the cuts that are in this bill, they would understand that it will have serious ongoing impacts on the quality of life for some of the most vulnerable families in our community. When people vote on this bill they must remember that. If their choice is that this legislation would best suit the way that we should make savings then they should be aware that people in this place will probably never be reliant on these payments—the family tax payment or the waiting period or the income-free areas for working age and student payments. I do not want to presume that, but it will be probable that no-one in this place will be reliant on these payments. So, when you all take a vote on this piece of legislation, remember that the evidence has been about the impact it will have on families, on parents, on students and on people who rely very heavily on the augmentation of a low wage or, in fact, in the case of waiting periods and the income-free areas for working age and student payments—no wage. These are the people who are reliant on this process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These savings measures have been consistently rejected by the Labor Party. I will put on record, as you well know, Madam Deputy President, that a number of the propositions brought to us by the government for savings in the social welfare area have been supported by Labor. We have not taken those decisions lightly. We have considered whether the impact of the saving is balanced by the need for budget repair. We have accepted whole chunks of savings over the last four years. In fact, from that awful 2014 budget onwards there have been a number of debates where we have voted with the government on savings. So, for anyone from the government to say that we never support budget savings, that we have no understanding of economic realities, it is just not true. All you have to do is look at the record. What we are saying is that the savings in this bill are not effective. They will harm and, in the end, they will not be the best way that we can support families in Australia. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have split the omnibus savings bill. In terms of the way the legislation will proceed, I think it is a good result to have split it into separate bills. But there is a feeling of division, a feeling of judgement, in the community that some families are being set up as being less worthy than others and that, if we are going to have effective child care, other parts of the community have to have things withdrawn. That remains. Whether the bill was split or not, that judgement remains. The people who came and spoke to us in community affairs feel as though their rights have been weighed up as being less worthy than others. I do not believe that that was the intent of the government. I believe that the government was aware of the need to have effective child care in our community—but at what cost? And will families continue to be divided? Will people continue to email us feeling as though their rights have not been supported, particularly stay-at-home parents, who feel as though they are not being valued in this process. They talk to us about how their needs should be addressed. This bill does not support them. The splitting of the omnibus bill may actually get a deal through and the separate bills will be passed—and that is what happens in this place. We understand it. But the impact and the harm to any sense of cohesion, to any sense of trust in the system, will remain. We will continue to have further debates and, as they continue, we will continue to have people come before us and talk about whether they genuinely believe that their parliamentarians understand their circumstances, and what may seem to be a relatively small part of the community will hurt. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise in support of the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. This legislation continues the efforts of the government to generate savings in response to the legacy of debt and profligate spending left by the previous failed Rudd and Gillard Labor governments. This includes their ridiculous legacy of expensive and unnecessary school halls, deadly pink batts that caught fire, the NDIS black hole and, of course, who could forget the multibillion dollar technological dinosaur of the NBN—all designed to grab headlines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also take this opportunity to congratulate the government on its decision to split the omnibus savings bill into its logical component parts. This is exactly the course of action advocated by Pauline Hanson's One Nation, and I am pleased to see that the government listened to us. Pauline Hanson's One Nation was very concerned that a range of disparate legislation was being clumsily bundled together and presented as a fait accompli to the Senate. This approach was entirely contrary to the spirit of parliamentary democracy. Separating savings bills to allow each measure to be considered separately makes sense, and I am very pleased that the government has recognised One Nation's argument to this effect and has shown its respect for the crossbench by amending its legislative program accordingly. I know that I speak for other crossbench senators when I say that we are grateful that the government has listened and acted in accordance with the wishes of the crossbench. This is real democracy in action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a strong supporter of Aussie working families, Pauline Hanson's One Nation strongly supports measures to help families cope with cost of living pressures, as part of which we support responsible changes to social services legislation to make income support for families sustainable in the long term, not just now. That is exactly what this bill does—making responsible savings to protect families in order to allow income support where and when it will be most needed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to achieve savings of $2.4 billion over the 2017-18 period, increasing to $6.8 billion over the following years. These are highly necessary savings. The Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 reprises three components of the former government's omnibus savings bill, namely: firstly, maintaining income-free areas and means test thresholds for certain payments and allowances at their current levels for three years; secondly, automating the income stream review process to allow improvements in the accuracy of income support payments; and thirdly, reductions in customer debts and appropriately extending waiting periods for the parenting payment and youth allowance for a person who is not undertaking full-time study and who is also not a new apprentice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also includes a new schedule to maintain current family tax benefit payment rates for two years at their current levels from 1 July 2017. As the minister has previously noted, this measure will not cut family tax benefits payments and will also not increase fringe benefits tax payment rates to offset the phasing out of family tax benefit supplements which was contained in the previously proposed social services legislation amendment. These are very modest and very necessary savings measures. They build on the efforts of the first omnibus savings bill which passed the Senate on 15 September 2016 and achieved $6.3 billion in budget savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In waiting to speak in support of this bill, however, I have had the I have had the misfortune to listen to the self-righteous and hypocritical cant emanating from the Greens and their Labor puppets. What absolute rubbish they speak! Just as Labor, the former party of the workers, is in lock-step with the industrial vandals, the Greens, in their efforts to abolish workers' jobs in coalmining, forestry and power generation, so too we see them here doing their very best to undermine even the government's modest efforts to balance the budget and to focus welfare to families in need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No party stands up for working Aussie families like One Nation. Only Pauline Hanson's popular nationalist party stands unapologetically behind coalminers, loggers and power station workers, whilst the Labor Party, which was originally formed to represent those people and their union, the CFMEU, stab them in the back. We do not trade away worker's penalty rates for corrupt union kickbacks and hookers for union bosses. To think that those opposite and their glorious leader have the nerve to try to claim that the government and One Nation are somehow responsible for the Fair Work Commission's decision to reduce penalty rates on weekends when they themselves have already sold them to the highest bidder. Let us not forget that the Labor Party froze family tax benefits A and B, that Labor lied when it claimed that One Nation supported cuts to pensions, and that Labor lied with its despicable 'Mediscare' campaign during the last election—</span>

                    </a>  I retract the word 'lie'. They wilfully sought to deceive ordinary Aussies in a campaign in a desperate attempt to grab power from the Liberals. Labor misrepresented 'Mediscare' and they are now misrepresenting the effects of this legislation. How despicable! How contemptible! Complete disregard and disrespect for the people of Australia and for this parliament. Labor's hypocrisy is just breathtaking.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great Ben Chifley and John Curtin must truly be turning in their graves. If they were alive today, I have no doubt that Ben Chifley and John Curtin would be One Nation leaders. They would know that Pauline Hanson's One Nation is the party that stands up for the rights of proud Australian workers. Ben Chifley and John Curtin would not sell out workers for political kickbacks like the Leader of the Opposition did. They would not sell out their own workers' jobs in mining, forestry and energy and today's so-called Labor Party has done. They would know where the light on the hill was. They would know the ALP have extinguished that light and plunged states like South Australia into darkness. Even the name ALP applied to the rabble of corrupt union apparatchiks and crypto-Marxists who fill the opposition benches would be an affront to Ben Chifley and John Curtin, those champions of the nationalist working class. No wonder they removed the letter 'u' from their latter day party name; they were no longer a labour party and they did not want a real worker to sue them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can just imagine what Ben Chifley and John Curtin would have to say to those opposite right now. They would be absolutely appalled. I can just imagine the great Ben Chifley thundering his opposition to Labor and their anti-Semitic Greens partners, fellow travellers in this chamber. Can you imagine what a One Nation Senator John Curtin would have to say to the leader of the Labor Party here in this chamber? What would he have to say to Senator Wong? He would be shocked and ashamed that the likes of Senator Wong pretend to lead the party that he used to represent and sneer at the honest Aussie workers her party should be defending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in truth not absolutely everything that those opposite have raised here is wrong, and this is to be expected. Despite the great hypocrisy of the current opposition leadership, its ideological bankruptcy and its extraordinary irrationality, right thinking may still not be beyond them. It is said that a baby, given enough time, will eventually recite the Gettysburg address. Or perhaps more prosaically, we know that even a stopped clock gets the time right twice a day. So we see that this is where Labor's truth is to be found these days—in the indubitable twice-a-day wisdom of the stopped clock. I note that, in a rare moment of clarity, an opposition senator observed that the budget measures proposed in this bill are very small savings compared with what could be generated if foreign multinationals paid their fair share of tax here in Australia. Well, honourable senators may be surprised to hear that One Nation could not agree more. This is why I raised this issue in my first speech six months ago and why our leader brought on the debate yesterday on multinational taxation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is, of course, a late convert to catching up with multinational tax dodgers. They recently had six years in government, which they spent like drunken sailors, but failed to even consider tackling this issue that is vital to families' cost of living. Contrary to the conclusion of my Labor colleagues, we do not consider fair taxation of multinationals to be an argument against the government's legislation. In fact, to conclude this actually makes no sense at all. Yes, foreign multinationals need to pay a fair share of tax here. We agree; and, unlike the Labor-Greens junta and the Liberal government, we intend to take steps to ensure that they do. However, these future increases in revenue are not an argument against taking responsible and long overdue steps to rein in the budget deficit now—'as well as, not instead of' should be our motto here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But perhaps the biggest problem with this legislation is that the government's ambitions to rein in debt and overspending are far too modest. There are many areas outside social services that we have identified and will pursue in the months ahead. Perhaps because the government continues to pander to Labor, to a leftist media and to flip-flopping centrist crossbenchers it seems to only ever tiptoe around the real issues in terms of spending cuts—window-dressing—just as we see very weak and timid measures proposed in other areas such as the drawn out and ultimately inconclusive agony over the fundamental issue of free speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The basic problem seems to be that the government is terrified of offending someone and being seen as too far to the right. One Nation is not afraid. We do not care about these perceptions. The Greens may believe that morality is a contorting Brazilian gymnast with a colourful costume, unlimited flexibility and an uncertain gender provenance. The Greens may believe that truth is an optional luxury or just another lie as yet undiscovered. But One Nation does not. Truth does not change depending upon one's standpoint, it does not disappear when it proves inconvenient, and it is not amenable to selective re-interpretation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no greater difference between political parties than revealed by the difference between the lying hypocrisy of Labor and the cultural Marxist immorality of the Greens compared with what One Nation represents. Love us or hate us, no-one can deny the utter sincerity of our beliefs. We do not try to say what we think will be safe or popular. We say what we believe is right and we face the consequences. Our nationalist movement recognises that objective truth exists. What concerns us is not perception but clarity. Win or lose, we will never resile or recant, we will never quit and we will never waver in our commitment to tell the truth and fight to restore the prosperous, law abiding, cohesive, monocultural nation that successive leftist governments have sought to destroy for over 40 years. One Nation will not linger ineffectually in this place nor slowly fade away. We will burn brightly like a meteor in the southern night sky, a harbinger that heralds the rebirth of One Nation to bring back Australia and protect Australian families.</span>

Already, less than 12 months after the election and 12 months after entering this chamber, I have already had a number of reasons to give speeches about the consequences of the dirty, dodgy preference deals between Pauline Hanson's One Nation party and her Liberal Party coalition partners. I have already had a number of reasons to speak about this. Not that long ago, in the debate about the ABCC bill, despite all their racist and xenophobic rhetoric about how everyone from overseas is a bad person and should be kept out, we saw Senator Hanson and her colleagues vote with their Liberal Party preference deal friends to make it easier for building companies to bring overseas workers on 457 visas onto Australian building sites at the expense of local workers. We saw Senator Hanson and her colleagues vote with the government only a few weeks ago to allow building companies to get rid of requirements in their enterprise agreements which would require them to employ more apprentices and give more young Australian kids a start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we have seen Senator Hanson flag that she is going to vote with her Liberal Party coalition colleagues to support the cut to penalty rates that will hurt so many Australian families right around this country. And tonight we see Senator Hanson and her colleagues again buddy up with Malcolm Turnbull and the LNP, as we know them in Queensland, to cut income support to the most vulnerable families in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said on many occasions, Senator Hanson and her colleagues have done a fairly good job over the last few months of running around Queensland in particular, and all around Australia, holding themselves out as the only people who care about the battlers in our community. If you are poor, disenfranchised, worried about the future, worried about what kind of job you are going to have and worried about what kind of job your kids are going to have, Senator Hanson and her colleagues would have you believe that they are in your corner fighting for you. But, time after time after time, we see Senator Hanson and her colleagues come down here into Canberra, where they think they are out of scrutiny and away from what Queenslanders and other Australians can see them doing, and they get behind closed doors and do dodgy deals with their coalition mates to deliver cuts to the most vulnerable people in our community, the very battlers that they say they are in politics to represent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight is yet another occasion when we are seeing this from Senator Hanson and her colleagues. It is not enough for them to go after the penalty rates of low-income working Australians. It is not enough for them to go after apprentices on building sites who are just looking to get a start to their career. It is not enough to go after the working poor; tonight they are coming in here and going after people who are not even working and not able to earn an income, by cutting some of the vital social security payments that these families depend upon to be able to feed their kids and make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know—it has become legendary—about the preference deals which were negotiated by Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues with Senator Cormann, Senator Cash and other members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. What we are seeing tonight, again, is the pay-off for those preference deals. They stitched up a nice little deal where they would swap preferences and get themselves elected in Western Australia. But any of us who have been involved in a deal or a negotiation, whether it is about buying a car, buying a house or getting votes, know that you do not get a deal without getting something in return. Tonight we are seeing yet again what the Liberal Party is getting in return for giving preferences to One Nation, and that is support for legislation which is going to hurt the most vulnerable people in our community. It is an absolute disgrace that vulnerable people in our community should be hurt by Pauline Hanson's One Nation party and the Liberal Party as the price of preference deals. We do not know what preference deals are going to be struck by these parties heading into the Queensland state election, the next federal election or other state elections all around the country, but what you can bet your bottom dollar on is that the price of getting any of these preference deals into the future is going to be the continued support of Senator Hanson and her colleagues to get through disastrous, draconian legislation that is going to hurt the most vulnerable people in our community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This afternoon, as I was getting ready to speak in this debate, I thought about someone I had spoken to who was thinking about voting for Senator Hanson at the last federal election. She was a very poor woman, just outside a very poor school in Rockhampton. She had dropped her kids off to school, and we had a bit of a chat to her about why she should vote Labor. She was telling us that she was actually thinking about voting for Senator Hanson, because she was really struggling to make ends meet, and she thought that Senator Hanson was the only person who was going to stand up for her. I said to her: 'Look, I understand why you feel unhappy and threatened by what's going on in society, and I understand why you can be tempted to vote for Senator Hanson, because she's saying all sorts of things that you might like, but you can bet your bottom dollar that, if she gets elected, she is going to sell you down the river. She is going to cut your social security, she is going to cut your wages and she is going to cut every benefit you get from the government, because she actually just doesn't care about poor and vulnerable people. She only cares about herself, her profile and keeping herself in parliament.' That woman was rightly sceptical; politicians say a lot of things during election campaigns. Well, wasn't I right? When I talked to this poor woman, who was clearly really struggling to make ends meet, wasn't I right that Senator Hanson was going to come in here, sell her down the river and sell out everything that she was promising to do for this woman? She is doing it again tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just briefly, let's think about what some of these cuts actually mean. First of all, the government, with the support of Senator Hanson, is going to freeze family tax benefits for two years. What that means in practice is that the family tax benefits that people receive from the government to help them make ends meet are not going to increase for two years. They are not going to keep pace with the cost of living increasing. Electricity bills might go up, the price of food might go up, the price of petrol might go up and phone bills might go up, but you are not going to get a single cent extra from this government and Senator Hanson to help you pay those increased costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not talking about wealthy families that are getting these benefits. There is a misconception out there in the community that it is wealthy or middle-class families that are getting these kinds of benefits. It is not true. There are 600,000 families in Australia who are getting the maximum family tax benefit A rate, which means that their household income is less than $52,000 per year. That is not a rich family, and they are not going to get any more money in family tax benefits from this government, with Senator Hanson's support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also, through this bill, going to freeze income-tax-free thresholds for single parents, jobseekers and students—again, no cost-of-living increase for any of these things—and they are going to extend the waiting period for parenting payments and youth allowance. So a single parent—a person, most likely a woman, whose family has broken up, who has custody of her kids and who is on her own—might in the past have been able to go to the government and get a parenting payment to get through, but she is now going to have to wait. What a kick in the guts for someone who has just gone through a family break-up! And who is making this happen? It is the LNP, the Liberals and the Nationals, with the support of Senator Hanson. How is that helping battlers? It is not; it is selling them out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse, these cuts are actually not needed. We already have the most targeted social security system in the world. This is not a bloated system going to waste; it is highly targeted at people who really need it. These cuts are not needed to pay for the childcare reforms that the government is putting through. Even childcare operators, who stand to gain from the childcare changes that are being made, told the Senate inquiry into this bill that the changes to child care have already been paid for. These cuts are not needed. They are not needed for budget repair. We all know there are other options that this government could be exploring if it actually wanted to bring in some more money for the budget. It could get rid of its $50 billion tax cut for big business. It could get rid of the negative gearing concessions that are available to wealthy Australians buying multiple investment properties. Why isn't Senator Hanson making the government take up those changes? That would be something that would actually help battlers. But no—she is in here voting with the government to hurt battlers and to take money off them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In politics from time to time you have to pick a side, and I am very proud that Labor has picked a side, and that is the side of battling people, vulnerable people and lower income people right across this country. We are standing up for their penalty rates, and we are standing up for the minimal social security payments that they already receive. On the other side of this chamber, the Liberals, the Nationals and Senator Hanson have also picked a side. They are for big business and for rich people in this community. They are not for battlers; they are going to sell them out every day of the week, and this is another tragic example.</span>

I am glad, in some respects, that I am following Senator Roberts, because he came in here to put the position of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party and he failed to put forward a coherent argument as to why they are supporting these measures.</span>

                    </a>  No, I am not surprised. He came in here to attack the Labor Party and to talk about why he is supporting these measures in front of us, but he failed to do so—he failed to coherently argue why. He attacked the Labor Party—the Labor Party who always stands up for working families. He talked about the light on the hill. I am very proud to be a Labor Party senator who protects the light on the hill—the light on the hill that is shining brightly. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that One Nation supporters listened to Senator Roberts's contribution in this debate tonight, because they will not be happy with his contribution. They will not be happy with the fact that it looks like Senator Roberts walked past the Liberal Party caucus room and picked up some speaking notes on this measure. They will not be happy that once again One Nation have thrown their lot in with this government, which is determined to rip money from those most vulnerable—the struggling families in our community. I hope anyone who is thinking of voting for One Nation heard that contribution, because just six weeks ago this government tried to ram through—again with the assistance of some of the crossbenchers—massive cuts to working- and middle-class families, to pensioners, to young people and to vulnerable Australians by tying these enormous cuts to their childcare package. We are finally landing where everyone knew we would. It is an absolute stitch-up—a dodgy deal cooked up in the dead of night with crossbench senators to rip money out of the pockets of struggling Australians. I am going to say this again, just for the benefit of Senator Roberts: struggling Australians. This is what this will do; this is what this bill before us, the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, will do—it will rip money out of the pockets of struggling Australians. It is absolutely galling to have the government come in here and try to ram through this new legislation without even allowing the Australian people, through the parliament, an opportunity to scrutinise the measures. It is a shameful act indeed. If senators have had, as I have had tonight, emails asking, imploring and begging them to vote against these measures, they should really go back and think about what ordinary Australians—their constituents, most likely—are now emailing them about. They are asking us to vote against the measures that we are debating here tonight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had no opportunity to scrutinise these measures, and they are from a government that is so out of touch with the Australian people they actually think it makes sense to make life harder for struggling Australians—the vulnerable, the sick, the elderly, the young, the jobless, the working- and middle-class families—while at the same time proposing to give away one of the biggest ever tax cuts in this nation's history to the big banks and multinational corporations. It is an absolute disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a smash-and-grab on the hip pockets of ordinary Australians. It makes this country more unequal. The government is seriously suggesting that, by taking money from the pockets of hardworking and struggling Australians and handing it over to multinational corporations that have money spilling out of skyscrapers in downtown Manhattan, they are acting in the interests of the Australian people or this nation's budget. This is about robbing ordinary Australians of assistance and of what they need to make ends meet—to put food on the table, to pay the rent. To come in here this morning and try to foist this on the Australian parliament without allowing proper debate is a low act indeed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of low acts, let us not forget that the Treasurer even tried to put into question future funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme by tying it to his government's now split omnibus bill. They should be ashamed of what they were trying to do. They go out there, they say they support the NDIS, and then they try to pit one section of the community against another. It is a shameful, shameful act. The Treasurer seriously said to Australians with disability, their families and their carers that he was going to put in jeopardy their NDIS just to satisfy his base political need to rip money from ordinary Australians and then shovel it off to his big business mates in a giant tax giveaway. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rushing through of this legislation is indicative of just how much chaos this government is in. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister, on Harmony Day, forced into proposing a bill to weaken the protections for race hate speech, just to satisfy the Abbott agitators in his party room—a bill which is dead on arrival in the Senate. His much vaunted childcare package, which he inherited from Mr Abbott, is the measure used to justify these zombie budget cuts from the horror 2014 Abbott-Hockey budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is simply implementing the agenda of his predecessor. It is a very sad state of affairs and an indictment of his leadership. It is no wonder that the Australian people have very quickly looked Mr Turnbull up and down and decided they are done with him. This government has nothing new to offer unless you are a big bank or a multinational corporation. They are still pursuing measures from their 2015 budget, measures comprehensively rejected by the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us tonight has $1.4 billion in cuts to family payments. Let's look at some of what is now in here—some of what has been snuck in by the government through their late-night deal making. The bill will freeze current family tax benefit rates for two years. This is a very impactful measure. It affects 1½ million Australian families, all of whom will be worse off. It leaves more than two million children worse off. Up to 600,000 of these families are on the maximum rate of FTBA. That means their household income is less than $52,000 per year. That is hitting some of the lowest-income people in Australia—families who need our help, families who expect us to do our job. How are we supposed to do our job and protect these families when the government and crossbenchers want to cook up cosy little deals to hide these cuts from the Australian people by ramming them through the Senate?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what is happening here tonight. Make no mistake—these bills are being rammed through the Senate with little scrutiny and with absolutely no opportunity for the Australian people to understand what the government is putting forward that will impact on them. Presented in this place, without any opportunity to scrutinise the contents of this bill, $1.4 billion is ripped from the pockets of low-income Australian families. It is another zombie measure from 2014, universally acknowledged as one of the most unfair budgets in Australian history. Of course we know what happened to former Treasurer Hockey, mostly because of the terrible 2014 budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor opposed this cut and we continue to do so now. Labor will not resile from our support for working and middle-class Australian families. We will stick up for them. We will defend them. We do not sell them down the river so we can give a huge tax cut to big banks and multinationals. This Government would not know a working-class Australian if they tripped over one. They are too busy rubbing shoulders with the big business elite. They are arrogant, they are out of touch, and it shows in this bill. This bill shows that they do not care how they will hurt ordinary Australians. The manner in which they have stumbled into the chamber today and thrown this onto the table shows just how out of control this ramshackle mob are. When Labor last opposed this measure the Liberals actually withdrew it from the parliament and took it out of the budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that family tax benefit payments play a critical role in helping to alleviate child poverty. They help low- and middle-income families cover the costs of children. They are a fundamental bedrock of the Australian tax and transfer payment system, a system designed to spread equity, to boost equality and to foster inclusive prosperity. This proposed freeze to indexation of family tax benefits means that these payments will not keep pace with the cost of living for two years. That means two years of cuts—cuts which will have an ongoing affect after the freeze is lifted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Families are under real pressure in this country. Bills are rising. Rents are sky high. Health costs are ballooning. Families cannot afford this. They do not deserve it. This bill is just another kick in the guts to hard-working Australian families. The truth is the Liberal Party's vision for Australia's future is about ripping up the basic social contract in this country. They want to make life harder for ordinary Australians, to make them poorer, all so they can line the pockets of their mates at the top end of town. It is 'lifters and leaners' all over again. That is just not the Australian way. We are a generous and compassionate country that deeply values fairness. Labor will never stop fighting for the values we know that Australian people hold. We will defend the lowest-paid workers in this country, many of whom will be affected by the proposed cuts to family tax benefits contained in this bill today. It is another blow to many workers who face real cuts to their take-home pay—700,000 workers who face a pay cut of $77 a week, cuts imposed on them by Mr Turnbull and his government because they refuse to back Labor's bill to protect penalty rates. It is a real demonstration of their priorities: all take and no give, unless—I am sure you know the answer, Madam Deputy President—you are a banker. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill attacks the incomes of students. It freezes for three years the income-free areas for all working age and student payments. This would mean that for three years the income tests applying to payments for single parents, jobseekers and students will not keep pace with the cost of living. This affects Newstart payment recipients also—again, some of the people doing it the toughest. This government, this Prime Minister, this Treasurer and some on the crossbench all say, 'I know: let's stick it to the jobless. Let's kick them while they're down.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will affect 204,000 Australians on the lowest incomes. The thresholds being frozen are already incredibly low. For example, for parenting payment the threshold after which the payment is reduced is $188 per fortnight. There is no rationale to freeze this for three years, no explanation for why this would be done. After all if the budget can afford a $50 billion splurge on the big banks and multinationals, some of which are overseas companies, why can't it afford to look after vulnerable Australians? These priorities are all wrong. The cuts in this bill mean that for Newstart the threshold after which the payments are reduced is $143 per fortnight. Let that sink in: $143 before their payment begins to be cut. And this will be frozen for three years. In 2020 it will still be $143. But we can afford to give big banks a tax cut. It is unbelievable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will stand up in this place today, tomorrow and Friday—whenever, wherever—and oppose these cruel cuts. But that is not all that is in this bill; oh no. The Liberals want to extend the one-week waiting period served by recipients of Newstart and sickness allowance to recipients of parenting payment and some youth allowance recipients. They also want to make it harder for people who are already in a perilous financial situation to access the financial hardship exemption by requiring that they also be experiencing a personal financial crisis. This is just one more example of Mr Turnbull's clear disregard for those who are struggling to make ends meet. Again, there is no policy rationale for this—just cuts to the most vulnerable: cut, cut, cut; hammer, hammer, hammer. That is all the Liberals know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we have already beaten their draconian five-week wait for Newstart, but now here we go again. Of course these cuts will be felt particularly acutely in my home state of Tasmania. We have a higher proportion of people in need of assistance payments. It is no wonder that when you treat the young, the sick, the aged, the jobless, and families and low-paid workers with such contempt you get a result that sees massive swings against the Liberal government and the loss of all their lower house seats in Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it goes on, because now they are even raising and issuing fake debt notices to payment recipients—demanding that they pay back money they do not even owe, putting the onus on them to prove that they do not owe it. How outrageous. Following the Centrelink robo-debt debacle, why would we trust the government with automation of payment review processes? Yet in this bill, again, supported by some in the crossbench, we have a measure that will automate the process by which the Department of Human Services collects income stream information. From 1 January 2018, a six-monthly electronic data collection process will be introduced for income stream information from financial service providers. We have already seen thousands of ordinary law-abiding Australians who did nothing wrong but were sent debt letters—pensioners being shaken down by debt collectors, horror stories, stories of unfairness. Now they want to extend the debacle. Well, it is just not on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will fight this smash and grab on vulnerable, working and middle-class Australians. We invite crossbenchers to do the same. Instead, some crossbenchers have come in here today and supported an hours motion to derail the orderly business of the Senate so they can support this bill. If the government were actually in control of their own agenda, if they were not in a constant state of rolling crises, they would be able to put their legislative agenda through the normal processes. But they do not want scrutiny. They do not want the Australian people to have the opportunity to see what it is they are seeking to ram down their throats. But of course, this bill fits neatly into the Liberal agenda. It is about making the poor poorer and the rich richer—textbook Liberal ideology. They all know it. It is in their DNA. It is the founding principle of Liberal philosophy. It is arrogant. It is out of touch: 1½ million families left worse off because of this bill, Tasmanian families left worse off because of this bill, 1½ million children worse off. They cannot afford it, they do not deserve it and they certainly do not deserve this government.</span>

                    <a href="144138" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  Thank you, Senator Dastyari, for very kindly arranging to assemble a crowd for my speech. I forgive senators if they go back to their tasks at hand. I know there is a lot of work being done tonight in this building and I am sure there are very important duties that must be returned to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, colleagues, what a cynical and petulant display we have seen from the Australian Labor Party tonight. They have mustered filibustering, talking it out, trying to keep us here as late as possible so they can demonstrate to their unions that they have at least put up a fight, they have tried their best, they know they do not have the numbers, but they are going to go down kicking and screaming in true Labor Party style. I have only been here for a year but I have seen it more often than I thought I would—tokenistic debates to drag out the time this afternoon to put on this petulant display.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's introduce some facts back into the debate. Let's remind those opposite of the situation they left this government in which has forced it to do the responsible and necessary thing of ensuring that important social reforms like the one proposed in child care this week by the minister, Senator Birmingham, can actually be paid for and delivered. I hate to have to remind those opposite, but these are the facts. The federal government this year is headed for a budget deficit of about $35 billion, just as it was last year. Gross debt is well on its way to $500 billion. That is the legacy this government was left by the previous government and that is the legacy that this government is trying to deal with. Unfortunately, we have had very little assistance from those opposite in dealing with that task. We would very much like to have fixed this task and dealt with it much sooner, but every reasonable attempt we have made to negotiate and propose different solutions to get the budget back into surplus and to get the debt paid down has been refused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember it was those opposite that broke the budget during the global financial crisis with reckless stimulus spending. We now know with hindsight that it was clearly excessive and unnecessary to keep the economy going. Let's remember it was those opposite had bedded into the budget long-term spending initiatives with no capacity or plans to pay for them. They knew, of course, that they were on the way out and it would never be their problem—it would never be up to them to balance the budget. This government wants to keep in place many of those important social reforms that we supported, such as the NDIS and good funding for schools, but this government is not willing to put the tab on future generations. This government knows that we have to pay today for the spending we incur today. We know that it is morally wrong to leave future generations to bear the burden of the excesses of this generation. Every dollar we spend today that we do not have is a dollar that will have to be paid back with interest by our children and grandchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The young people who will benefit improved initiatives in this childcare package are also the ones who will have to pay the full cost of that and many other things the government spends money on today. That is because those opposite left the budget in such a state of disarray and worked so hard to obstruct this government's attempt to return to surplus. I think that is morally wrong. I want to see improved, better-targeted, quality child care, as the minister has devised. I would like to see families receive the benefit of better-targeted child care and subsidies to ensure the money is going to those who need it most and not to those who do not need it—those highest income earners. In order to do that, we have to pay for it. It is not responsible to continue to put it on the credit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember that those opposite took to this election a childcare policy which made no changes to the broken system. They simply planned to pump more money into a bad system that everyone in the sector and every expert said was broken and needed to be fixed. Let's remember that it was this government and the minister, Senator Birmingham, who proposed a solution to that—a reform which has been widely praised within the sector and by experts as being better targeted, as going to those who need it most and as an initiative that will encourage workforce participation. The reform will ensure that families do not run out of childcare subsidies halfway or a third of the way through the year and are then faced with the difficult decision of having the second income earner continue to work or to stay at home and look after the children, even if they prefer to be working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the reform proposed by the government, which those opposite suggest they support to some extent, although they have not been clear whether they will actually vote for it. I eagerly await to see how they will exercise their votes this week. I will go through some of the initiatives that this government has proposed for funding this program. I think they are incredibly reasonable initiatives. Of course, no-one in government ever likes to cut back or to rein in spending but any responsible government knows that it is not right to send more money out the door than you are collecting. That is what those opposite propose that we do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new bill contains three measures from the original omnibus bill. The first is maintaining income-free areas and a means-test threshold for certain payments and allowances at their current level for three years. That is not taking anything away and that is not cutting anything back; it is simply maintaining the status quo for the next three years. It is a modest and reasonable measure. The second is automating the income-stream review process to improve the accuracy of income-support payments and reductions in customer debts. We know the trouble those opposite have in ensuring that the right amount of welfare is paid to those who are entitled to it, but not a dollar more. We know the protests that they have put in place against the government's attempts to recoup the debts which were incurred during their time in office, but which they made no reasonable attempts to recover. We know their desire to stop a successful program which today is discovering people who have been wrongly paid welfare they are not entitled to, and we know how much they have fought efforts to ensure those taxpayer dollars have been put to good and appropriate use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third measure extends and simplifies ordinary waiting periods for the parenting payment and for youth allowance for a person who is not undertaking full-time study and is not a new apprentice. The bill also includes a new schedule to maintain the current family tax benefit payment rates for two years at their current levels from 1 July 2017. This measure will achieve savings of about $2 billion over the 2017-18 forward estimates, which will build to $5.5 billion over the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really important that we note for the record here tonight and for anyone who might be watching that under this new measure there will be no cuts—that is, no cuts—to family tax benefit payments. You could be forgiven, having listened to some of the emotional speeches from the other side, for thinking that that might be the case, but it is not. Indeed, over the two-year maintenance period, many families will in fact see an increase in their payments as a result of increases to particular income thresholds for family tax benefits. As the minister said in the other place earlier this week when introducing this legislation, the government has also reversed a previous decision to increase FTB payment rates to offset, in part, the effect of the phase-out of FTB supplements, which was a measure contained in the original omnibus savings bill. Not proceeding with that increase in family tax benefit payment rates will, compared with the previous social services omnibus savings bill, reduce the cost by a further $2.3 billion over the current forward estimates period and reduce the costs over the medium term by about $11 billion. So we are not proceeding with an increase that was actually included in a previous bill, which those opposite indicated they would not support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill further builds on the $6.3 billion in budget improvements over the forward estimates achieved through the original omnibus bill, which passed the Senate earlier this year. Here I give due credit to those opposite. They did vote for one initiative that reduced spending and helped get the budget back to surplus, but they should not be too proud of that, because all that initiative did was take the savings measures they proposed during the election and put them in a bill that was introduced into this place. Of course, it was not an easy process. They did kick and scream on the way to voting for their own savings initiatives, promised at the election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the government's intention to secure the passage of both this bill and the childcare bill through the Senate this week. If we are able to do that, Australian families will be able to rely on a childcare system that better suits and targets their needs and that helps control the cost of child care, which families have told us is the No. 1 pressure on the household budget. That is what this government has been seeking to do since the election, and that is what this government has been frustrated in its attempts to do by this chamber, in particular those opposite. I hope, through the long debate tonight and probably tomorrow night, that those opposite take the opportunity to reflect on the fact that they are standing in the way of a better childcare system which better targets the scarce resources that the government has at its disposal. The bill will ensure child care is more affordable for families and better targeted to those middle-income families who rely on it most and on whom it will have the most positive impact in terms of workforce participation. I hope those opposite reconsider their decision to delay, obstruct and prevent it from being implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard loud and clear from Australian families, particularly those with young children, that this is an important and overdue reform, and we are doing our very best to fix the broken system that was presided over by our predecessors. It is disappointing, but not surprising, that those opposite are not assisting us in that task, but I hope they have cause to reflect on that over the duration of this debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:34</span>):  What a pleasure it is to contribute to this debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 and to follow Senator Paterson. I want to take a couple of moments to address some of the issues that he raised. To stand there and say that in having this debate we are looking after our union friends is bordering on ludicrous. Mr Acting Deputy President, for a bloke like Senator Paterson—whose greatest achievement to date in life has probably been to stay awake in his university lectures—to come in here and talk about family budgets is, well, a little bit rich. Here he is in this chamber lecturing the Labor Party about who we represent. I have to tell you, Senator Paterson, we know who we represent, and in the main it is the ordinary hardworking Australians who go carefully about their business, building the fabric of Australian society. Occasionally, their skills and their expertise do not allow that. But of course, as I think one of the government's ministers stated: 'No problem—if you've got an issue buying a house, just get a better job.' Well, where I live, quite often those better jobs are not available. People go to work every day and make ends meet in difficult circumstances. Occasionally, though they go to work every day, five or six days a week, their income is still not enough and they are entitled to some compensation, some assistance, from a benevolent government. May I say, I think some of the initiatives that they now enjoy originated in the government of Prime Minister Howard, probably one Senator Paterson's heroes, who saw fit to recognise that working families without the capacity to 'go and get a better job' might actually need a bit of assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here is a remnant of the 2014 budget. After the 2014 budget, a very long serving senator said to me that six weeks after most budgets no-one can recall them, but the 2014 budget is etched in the memory of every voting Australian. We know the lifters and leaners speech. We know the whereabouts of the former Treasurer—we know he is in Washington enjoying life large. It was the end of his career, the 2014 budget—the night of the big fat cigar and the glass of wine, when he was playing 'The best day of my life'. It was not the best day of his political life, because he is no longer in the parliament and he no longer enjoys support of his colleagues. Fortunately for the Hon. Joe Hockey, he is now in Washington enjoying a vastly superior outcome to that of most of the working families in South Australia, most of whom are on $52,000. That is probably his grog bill in Washington for a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the government side come in here and lecture us about doing work to support these people. It is our duty. It is why we were elected. It is what we are here for. We are here to support working families and people who do not have position, power and privilege. That lot on the government benches are on side with those who have position, power and privilege. They are all for it. They want a $50 billion tax cut for them. They want to look after position, power and privilege.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Labor Party's side, we are very proud to be on the side of those who occasionally need a leg up. They do not need it all the time. People on our side of the political spectrum are successful. They are small businesses, upper-middle-class people who have make good, people who have enjoyed a free tertiary education. They are loyal Labor Party members. But we all recognise that there are people who occasionally need support, whether it is because of geographical reasons or whether it is because there was a decision to shut down manufacturing industry and, in terms of motor vehicles, put potentially 200,000 Australians out of work. There has to be recognition of their circumstances, and occasionally there has to be government intervention in terms of making sure those people get a fair shake. That is a humane, ordinary political measure, but it does not come naturally to the dry economic rationalists, like Senator Paterson, who have never had a day when they have had to worry about paying a bill or a mortgage, who have never been worried about whether there is enough food to feed their children, who have never had an unemployed neighbour who is struggling from week to week and needs to come and borrow a couple of bucks to get through till the weekend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at what the government are doing. They are actually making a $1.4 billion cut to Australian families. Their argument is: do not worry, we are just going to give it back in another way. Those people whose rate is frozen for two years will be worse off. This means that 1.5 million families will be worse off, and, most importantly, those who cannot yet vote—2 million children—will be worse off. Is that what Senator Paterson and his side really want to do?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They go on about fixing the budget. All senators in this place are across a number of committees. I am on the Public Works Committee, and I am not impressed with the way this government spends money. Some 85,000 square metres of new property has been leased at a cost of $900 million. There is no real justification of the need for the new property. It will cost $250 million to fit it out and $256 million to put furniture and chairs and tables in it. To add insult to injury, they are borrowing about $150 million of that and paying $44 million in interest. Then they come into this chamber and say that someone on Newstart is getting too much. The Business Council of Australia recognises that Newstart is a disincentive for people to be able to find work. If you are on Newstart, there is not enough to allow you to clothe yourself, get the amenities of life and present properly for a job interview.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government cannot keep cutting these areas. It is counterproductive. And it wants to make them wait longer. Senator Hanson is saying, 'Well, they just finish school and get on the dole.' I do not know any people like that, but I do know that people on Newstart are doing it extremely tough and this government wants to make it tougher. There will be 1.5 million families and almost two million children who will be worse off. There are 600,000 households that are on the maximum rate of FTB A. That is an acronym; no-one understands what 'FTB A' means when you use acronyms. We are all fond of this sort of jargon, but the guts of it is this: their income is less than $52,000 a year, and this is for a family. They have to pay their rising electricity costs, they have to pay all of their rising grocery costs and they have to pay their public transport costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will digress for a moment. No-one has actually written to the American government or to America and said, 'Thank you for inventing hydraulic fracking and making yourself self-sufficient in fuel,' because the one thing that has not really gone up in price in Australian society is the cost of fuel. However, if you are on a Newstart payment, it is still a significant impediment to filling up a car's petrol tank. I do not know if Senator Paterson has ever realised this, but at many services station there is now a minimum purchase amount. There is a $20 minimum at the service station I go to. If you are only getting 150 bucks a week, a $20 minimum when you go to the service station to fill up the tank for that job interview during the week is a pretty severe impost. We are making it tougher for them—tougher, not better. It is an absolute disgrace.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those over there on the government side will rest easy because those with position, power and privilege are who they are looking after. Their main game is to give big business a tax cut funded out of budget repair which attacks those in the economy least able to defend themselves because of where they live geographically, because of the reduction in manufacturing or because they do not have the educational qualifications that would enable them to get that better paid job that someone on the government side said they should get. They have no worries about house prices, just 'go and get a better job'. These people are completely out of touch with reality. They ought to climb out of their ivory towers, forget about power, position and privilege and start mixing with ordinary Australian workers in ordinary Australian electorates. I dare say there are plenty on the backbench who would understand and recognise what I am saying, because they probably do move in circles a little bit less august than that creme de la creme who purport to be the leadership of this Liberal government. I reiterate: a lot of these measures that will be cut would have originated with the Howard government recognising the place of families in Australian society and their need for these measures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We get accused of filibustering. I do not think it is a filibuster when you carefully and appropriately identify what is coming. At the end of this vote, what is coming in this budget is a regurgitation of Joe Hockey's horrendous 2014 budget—the one that got him the sack, if you like; the one put the entire government on the nose, if you like; the one they celebrated with a cigar and wine as 'the best days of our lives'; and the one that was going to repair the whole of Australian society until people actually understood what it was doing. It was the antithesis of what the electorate wanted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have moved on. We have moved on from the Hon. Tony Abbott as Prime Minister, we have moved on from the Hon. Joe Hockey as Treasurer, and they are at it again. They are building up, coming in here, lecturing us about our opposition to what is a dastardly attack on ordinary Australians going about their business and trying to make ends meet.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just talk about some of the things that this bill will do. This bill will also freeze, for three years, the income-free areas for all working age and student payments. Think about that. They are entitled to a payment and they are entitled to the income-free area. I would have thought, in order to get someone off a payment, you would be more generous in what they could earn income free. You would be more generous, not less generous. Look, if somebody is on Newstart and is able to get three months' work up the Riverland picking fruit or learning new skills, I would have thought you would be more generous in that area, not less generous. Through that investment, people may then, through some casual work, be able to get their endeavours recognised. A reasonable employer may say, 'Look, I have to move a bit; I can get a bit of assistance from the state government of South Australia—$10,000 for a worker. Maybe I can make a go of this and we'll offer them some employment.' But instead of making that more accessible, this bill makes it less accessible. They are freezing the income-free areas for all working age and student payments. This means that, for three years, the income test applying to payments for single parents, jobseekers and students will not keep pace with the cost of living. You are almost consigning people to endless poverty because you are not allowing them to go out and have a go. I mean, if they go out and have a go and it is reduced and they get into the bureaucratic red tape, and they cannot get back to paying their bills, they end up completely behind the eight ball. This will affect 204,000 Australians on the lowest incomes. It is particularly of concern with Newstart. The Australian Business Council recognises that Newstart is actually a disincentive for people who get it to actually get a job. They are not getting enough money to actually present at an interview in a way that will gain them employment. That is not the unions or the Labor Party is saying. That is what their mob is saying—that Newstart has fallen to such a level that it is an absolute disincentive to prepare people for work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They come in here and say that we are opposing it because we are supporting trade unions. We are opposing it because what they are doing is manifestly unfair. It is bad enough that is manifestly unjust and unfair, but it is also economically stupid. It is economically stupid to consign people to a poverty rate payment where they are not able to move off it. To reduce the income-free area is madness. It does not keep pace with inflation; it does not keep pace with anything. What are these people supposed to do? What the more enterprising of them will do is seek cash payments. They will try and go around the system. If I was in that situation, I would not be shy about it. It is manifestly economically stupid to reduce the income-free payment. You should be actually making sure that people can earn as much as they can in a robust manner so as you can move them completely off the dole, and then everybody wins. But, no, that is not what this government is doing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Waiting periods—they want to extend the one-week waiting period served by recipients of Newstart and sickness allowance to recipients of parenting payment and some youth allowances. They want to make it harder for people who are already doing it pretty tough to access financial hardship exemption. Basically, you will have to prove that you are experiencing, say, personal financial crisis before you can access any of the remedial payments that might help your circumstances. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Malcolm Turnbull, obviously, has never met a person who has struggled on Newstart. He may say that he has, but the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull has clearly not looked through the world from the prism of Newstart payments. Good luck to the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull; he is a very successful character. He is worth more money than most in the parliament and I do not begrudge him one cent of that. But I do begrudge a government that looks at it through a totally punitive prism and says that the $143 that you may be able to earn income free is going to be frozen. We are not going to allow it to go to $150, $155 or $160.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that we should be more adventurous in this space. We should be allowing these people to take on employment for six months, hoping that we move them completely away from that bloody horrendous poverty trap. But we do not do it, because we have that party over there—One Nation and Senator Hanson—alleging that the only people on the dole are people who do not want to work. Well, that could not be further from the truth. I do not think I have ever met a person on Newstart who actually wanted to be on Newstart. It is an accident of their educational circumstances, geography, personal health or mental health in a lot of cases. They all want to move off it and we—and I would include Labor in this—have not done, in recent history, a good job of designing a system that allows them to move away from poverty. And this makes it worse. It is draconian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the moment, we have beaten the five-week waiting period, but, make no mistake, as with the penalty rates issue they will just keep coming. Senator Paterson—it is led by that sort of type. He has never had a real job in his life. The only thing he has ever done is stay awake through three university courses. Now, he is a senator over there lecturing this side of the chamber about how workers think and how workers feel in the real electorate because he has this prism that says, 'Our debt is rising.' I tell you what, why doesn't the government actually look at the debt and say, 'What is for infrastructure? What is productive debt? What debt have we borrowed for infrastructure? And what is the productivity factor on that borrowing?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you excised that, looked at your income, looked at your recurring expenditure then you may have a valid case. If you have got income and recurring expenditure, take out your productive debt, take out the debt for infrastructure, but they do not choose to. They lump it all together because they can frighten people with bigger numbers to attack the most vulnerable people in society—those on Newstart, those on parenting payments, families earning less than 52,000 bucks a year. You have got school fees, rising electricity costs, grocery costs, and this government is coming in here expecting us to say: 'You have got the numbers so we are not going to have a debate.' I am looking forward to debating this for as long as we possibly can. I am up to the challenge of pulling people like Senator Paterson into line. His budget at the moment is how much can I spend everywhere? His budget is not how much do I need to save?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is we are here to represent ordinary hardworking Australians who, in a lot of cases, are still doing it extraordinarily tough. If I go back to Newstart, it is a disgrace that we have not got a system that allows people to take a job, earn a reasonable amount of money over six months and then vacate the system, vacate the whole Newstart process. The system is really punitive. If that does not work for them, they then go back to: how do I survive? Do I have to go couch surfing for a living?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:54</span>):  I will start by pointing out the obvious as others have done; this bill is unfair. There has been $1.3 billion taken out of family tax benefit through freezing the indexation, a $1.3 billion cut for Australian families. And by freezing indexation, the government is ripping money away from people and families that need it. We have a tightly targeted welfare system. There are some countries that have broadly available welfare payments but Australia is not one of them. In our country, in order to be eligible for these payments, you have to prove some level of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are almost 600,000 families on the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A. What that practically means is their household income is less and $52,000. It is not much. These are not families that have money for luxuries. This family tax benefit goes towards paying the grocery bills, goes towards buying new school shoes, goes to paying for excursions, and the freeze on indexation of these payments means that they will not keep pace with the cost of living over the next two years. The freeze for three years on the income-free areas for all working age and student payments means that the income test will not keep pace with the cost of living, and Australians will work less and less before the payment reductions start to kick in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know in this place arguments about the impact on vulnerable people fall on deaf ears for that side of the chamber. This government is not moved by these arguments because it obviously does not care. Since the 2014 budget, the government has gone out of its way to strip support from the poor and from the vulnerable. But the government's war on the poor has macro-economic consequences and they come at a time when we cannot afford them. Payments to low-income earners stimulate the Australian economy. Here is the logic: low-income earners are more likely to spend all the money they receive. If you are an economist, you call this the marginal propensity to consume, and the rest of us just call it common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are a single mother working in retail in my state, say, somewhere like Dubbo, then the most recent census figure shows that the average retail worker employed in a regional area will earn just $32,000 a year. What will that woman do? She will stretch her income to last the week and she will have to spend every last dollar. This will not change from week to week because discretionary spending is not a characteristic of this woman's life; it makes up a much smaller portion of household spending for lower income earners than higher income earners for very obvious reasons, because money is always spent on the essentials. This woman is less likely to save because she really just does not have money to spare and she is certainly less likely to spend money overseas on her $32,000-a-year wage. If this woman receives support from the Australian government then that money will be spent here in Australia in her local community and that drives growth. This is not just wishful thinking; this is the view of the IMF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IMF released a discussion paper back in 2015 where it explained that if you lift the income share of the bottom 25 per cent of a nation by one percentage point then GDP growth increases as much as 0.38 per cent in the country over five years. By contrast, if you lift the income share of the top 20 per cent by one percentage point then GDP growth decreases over that same period. It is interesting to note in that context that we are having this debate at exactly the same time as the government continues to insist that it will legislate a $50 billion tax cut which will have benefits for the very wealthy in this community. What did Christine Lagarde say about this? She suggested that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the benefits of higher incomes are trickling up, not trickling down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth considering too that we debate this in a week when the government continues to insist that it is supportive of cuts to penalty rates. Cuts to interest penalty rates for Australia's low-income workers does not just hurt them; it hurts us. Analysis by the McKell Institute found that a partial abolition of penalties in the retail and hospitality sectors would mean that retail and hospitality workers in rural Australia would lose between $370 million and $1.5 billion each year depending on the extent of the cut. This in turn would reduce disposable income for spending in regional areas by between $174.6 million and $748.3 million. The McKell Institute concluded, quite rationally, that this would have a disastrous impact on the financial viability of the local businesses which rely on the wages of local employees to buy their products and services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is hurting the economy, taking active steps to hurt the economy at a time when it needs help. The national accounts showed that we grew in the last quarter, but it is not the whole story. The wage growth in this country has become decoupled from economic growth, because the growth is being driven by export prices rather than by domestic demand. And what are we doing? What does the proposed legislation ask us to do? It asks us to further reduce domestic demand at the same time that we have lower wages and salaries, which in themselves are reducing domestic demand. It is hard to see how this could possibly be helpful for the health of the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I talked about the impact of penalty rate cuts in regional areas. I remind my fellow senators that I come from a regional area. I grew up in a place that had extraordinarily high levels of long-term unemployment. A lot of people go to the north coast for holidays, and it is a very nice place to holiday. But it is also a place that has continuing high levels of poverty, very high levels of unemployment and very large numbers of households with very low incomes. I know that cuts to benefits and cuts to penalty rates have a very particular impact on the region. In those regions where dependency on penalty rates and benefits is high, people depend on those things to make ends meet. Eight out of 10 of the poorest electorates in our country are in the regions. What is proposed this evening would reduce the income of people who would otherwise spend the money in local businesses in their own towns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are moving to a new version of the two-speed economy between the cities and the regions. At the beginning of March, research was published that showed Australia's two largest cities drove two-thirds of Australia's growth in the last fiscal year. Sydney's central business district, stretching out to Macquarie Park, made up 24 per cent of GDP growth in the financial year to June 2016. Inner Melbourne contributed 11.4 per cent of GDP growth. It is in stark contrast to regional Australia, particularly those regions where the end of the mining investment boom means that there has been a very significant slowing of the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see it reflected in the unemployment figures. In Sydney's eastern suburbs—the Prime Minister's part of town and a nice place to live—what is the unemployment rate? It is 3.1 per cent. In places like New England and north-western New South Wales, what is it? Unemployment is more than double. It is sitting at 7.7 per cent. There is a similar pattern in Queensland. In Brisbane, unemployment is 3½ per cent. In Cairns, the unemployment rate is closer to eight per cent. In outback Queensland, it sits at 11.6 per cent; that is up from about four per cent just 18 months ago. The regions are already doing it tough, but do we see any measures being brought into this chamber to deal with that, to actually stimulate regional economies? No, we do not. Instead, we see cuts—cuts to penalty rates and cuts to benefits that pile up on top of the pressures already being faced by country towns and regional towns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I started by saying that I understand that those opposite will not be moved by talk of hardship. They have not met an ordinary working family that they did not want to rip money away from. But you would think that those opposite would care about the economic impact of their decisions; they do not. I put it to you tonight that that is because they are stuck in an old economic paradigm—one better suited to the 1980s than to the circumstances we face now. It is one that I acknowledge is closely aligned to their ideological preferences for blaming individuals when they find themselves in hard times and one that means they bring in legislation like this that will hit the poorest and most vulnerable in our community. </span>

They will vote with the Liberals on this to sell out country people, to sell out battlers and to sell out poor people. It is part of an irrational, ideological campaign by the Liberal Party. For the life of me, I cannot understand why these other parties are speaking out in support of it. I say tonight: shame on them.</span>

Once again, we see the truly twisted priorities of this coalition government in evidence in the bill before us. I want to focus on the heartless cuts to the family tax benefit, which is one of the biggest cuts as part of this particular measure. Before I do so, I want to comment on the fact that—this picks up on Senator McAllister's point—not only is this a truly unfair and heartless measure, it also defies economic logic and comes within the category of economic vandalism. I will explain what I mean by that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, indicated that record low wage growth was 'the biggest challenge facing the Australian economy'. He made those comments following the decision of the Fair Work Commission which we have discussed quite often in this place. That decision attacks the Sunday penalty rates of thousands of hospitality and retail workers. We know that Mr Morrison has indicated that low wage growth is a big challenge, but I understand he told Bloomberg that he was committed to ensuring workers took home more money each week. He said that he is looking to increase the pay packets of workers and to increase household income. That is a laudable objective. We do not dispute that it is a great idea for workers to receive more money in their pay packets, because of the obvious fact, noted on so many occasions, that low-income workers in particular end up spending most of what they earn, and that in turn is a benefit to the economy and a benefit to small business, who end up being the beneficiaries of that spending in the economy. He said that the biggest challenge we have is to ensure that what Australians are earning every week is increasing. Having said that, one scratches one's head to understand how a massive $1.4 billion cut to Australian families is going any way towards increasing the amount of spending that is going to occur in the economy. It might be a very short-term and short-sighted budget measure which perhaps the coalition can boast about in certain quarters, but, when it comes to doing something about addressing our economic issues on a legitimate basis, this particular measure is, as I said, in the category of economic vandalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison talked about the fact that the benefit of the penalty rate cut decision of the Fair Work Commission was that workers would be able to earn more if workplaces were open as opposed to closed because the bosses were struggling to earn a profit, but I talk to people who work in the retail industry. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, I was a union official in the shop assistants union for many years. At that time my members indicated to me that they knew that retailers did not staff their stores with any degree of generosity. They would staff a store to the absolute minimum that is required to meet the workload at that time, and even then there were skeleton staff levels in place. So we know that in retail in particular, which is an area that I can speak about with some degree of authority, those cuts to penalty rates are going to be absorbed into company profits. That is where they are going to go. They are not going to go into the pockets of workers who are working extra hours; they are going to go straight into company profits. I hear those opposite saying, 'Company profits going up—that's actually a good thing and that's going to lead to more workers being employed if businesses are more profitable.' If that were the case, why is it that we have company profits at an all-time high? I understand that, as at the fourth quarter of 2016, that was the situation—company profits were at an all-time high at an average of $77.773 billion—and yet at the same time we had the issue of record low wages growth. There is something wrong with the theorem under which the coalition is operating if they think that increased corporate profits necessarily translate into wages growth in more jobs. They have to look at the empirical evidence, as my friend Senator Roberts would say. The empirical evidence says that the linkage between profits and wage growth and employment is broken. We are in a new paradigm, so we need to have another look at that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that Reserve Bank Governor, Mr Lowe, last month warned that record high household debt and record low wage rises were limiting consumer spending and hurting the national economy. Once again I ask the question: how is it going to be the case that these cuts to family tax benefits of $1.4 billion, roughly, taken out of the budgets of Australian families, are going to assist with consumer spending and how is that going to assist the national economy? I also note that many economists have predicted that the small increase in wage growth that we experienced last month is going to do little to increase consumer spending, which many businesses rely on. This is not highfalutin economic theory; a lot of this is common sense. This is something that one would have thought otherwise rational people within the coalition would be looking at, but there seems to be an ideological agenda at play and common sense is not coming into the equation. There is a set of twisted priorities which is working its way through into government policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $1.4 billion cut from families was actually a 2014 budget measure. It is something that has come back. They regurgitated it after the unfair 2014 budget measures were, in many senses, seen off three years ago. By freezing the current family tax benefit rates for two years means that 1½ million families will be worse off and more than two million children will be worse off. I have to ask the question: what does this government have against the children of Australia when families are struggling as it is to meet the cost of living? Here we see further pressure being piled upon working families by this government. Almost 600,000 of these families are on the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A, which means that their household income is less than $52,000 per year. Unfair cuts are hitting these people again and again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this low wage growth is an issue. When I was in Gladstone and Mount Morgan in Queensland last week, I met with workers and unions and I saw firsthand how this government's decision to support the cuts to penalty rates, which are piled on top of the cuts, will affect them. It is going to be devastating to these people. Not only is it an unfair situation; it is lunacy when it comes to economic policy and trying to stimulate our economy, lift wages growth and get growth up generally within the economy. I ask the coalition to think about putting themselves in the shoes of a single-income family right now. Those people are literally struggling to make ends meet as it is. Today's bill only compounds the problem with $1.4 billion being ripped out of the pockets of low-income families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the history of these cuts that were first introduced in the 2014 budget. Let's remember: that budget became synonymous with unfairness and twisted priorities. It was a budget written by a gentleman who told young Australians to get a better job if they wanted to buy a house. He was also the Treasurer, as I recall, who formed the conclusion that poor people did not drive cars and so were not affected by the costs of running motor vehicles. This was a budget cut that was endorsed back then by our current Prime Minister, who has said that parents could just shell out for their child's first home. So we remain opposed to this 2014 budget measure. It is, I think, an indictment of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed freeze to indexation of the family tax benefit means that those payments will not keep pace with the cost of living for two years, so that will just pile extra pressure on households. The truth is that this government's vision for Australia's future is about ripping up the basic social contract in this country. We are not a nation of lifters and leaners, no matter what the former Treasurer, Mr Hockey, said. We are a generous and compassionate country that deeply values fairness, and Labor will continue to defend the lowest paid workers in this country, many of whom are going to be affected by the proposed cuts to the family tax benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding my remarks, I want to talk about those that are actually in favour of these cuts. In particular, I would like to draw attention to the One Nation party. We know that One Nation votes with the Liberals at least 87 per cent of the time. We know that during the Western Australian election campaign Senator Hanson sold Queenslanders out by trying to reduce our share of the GST. For a party that claims to stand up for battlers they are doing a fantastic job of selling them out. In fact, they have done such a great job of selling out Queenslanders that two weeks ago our local newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courier Mail</span>, featured a full-page expose on One Nation's unsuccessful foray into Western Australia. Make no mistake, the people who will be impacted by these cuts are the very same people who vote for One Nation. In fact, One Nation is fast becoming a haven for those in the far right of the LNP. 'Don't worry,' they say to each other, 'we'll pass these measures with One Nation, so we can hide behind their banner and each other.' When it comes to getting a fair go, Queenslanders are getting a raw deal under this LNP-One Nation coalition in the Senate. Workers are getting a $77-a-week pay cut while big business is getting a $50 billion tax cut. What I would say to both One Nation and the LNP is: stop selling out the battlers, do the right thing, stand up against these harsh cuts and stand up for Queenslanders.</span>

                    <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:17</span>):  It is indeed a pleasure to follow on from my colleague Senator Ketter, who spends much time in regional Queensland and who gave a good account of the impact that these cuts will have on regional Queenslanders. Particularly at a time when a lot of those local economies are struggling and unemployment is high, these impacts will be felt very deeply by those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about the 2014 budget, which is really the genesis of what we are talking about here tonight. As many people will know, I was not in the chamber as a senator at that time, but I was obviously following very closely. I have seen some political train wrecks in my time—I have indeed been a close observer to some. But in modern history that 2014 budget will go down as one that wrecked the career of a number of politicians who contributed to it, but also set in train what has been a continual decline in the primary vote of the Liberal Party and the National Party in Australia. You can trace all that back to that budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that you look at the architects of that budget. Many people in this debate have talked about former Treasurer Joe Hockey. We all know what he is doing now, but the reality was that budget was the start and downfall of his career as Treasurer. We know where he has ended up. But it was also the same with former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. That budget was the starting point of the downfall of his prime ministership, and we all know how that ended up. At that time, because I was the Queensland state secretary gearing up to run a state campaign, I saw the damage that that budget did to the Liberal Party broadly across Queensland, where the Liberal-National Party in Queensland became synonymous with cuts. Whether it be at the federal level, whether it be at the state level, the Liberal-National Party from that day forth became synonymous with cuts. Sure, it was added to in Queensland with Campbell Newman making drastic cuts to public servants, to health care and to education—the important social services that so many Queenslanders rely on—but it really was dominated and started by the federal budget in 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned what happened to those two. We know what happened to Joe Hockey and we know what happened to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, but the other architect of that was Senator Cormann. He seems very good at claiming credit for being the architect of things, but accepts none of the responsibilities. He is the one that is still here in this chamber responsible for that budget. We are absolutely going to hold them to account for that. We have done it for three years and we will continue to do it for as long as it takes, because we know the community are on our side. So we look forward to taking this fight to the next federal election, because we know we are on strong ground defending those people that are going to be affected by it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another deal, and this is another example of Senator Cormann trying to get away with his actions. That is in regard to the deal with One Nation in Western Australia. We all know the devastating impact that had not only on the Western Australian Liberal Party but also on One Nation. Since then, we have seen Senator Hanson say that it was a mistake, but we have seen none of that contrition from Senator Cormann, the architect of that deal. I think that speaks volumes for the way that he has operated in this chamber and in this debate over the budget. But when it comes to One Nation, they said that that deal was a mistake—and where are we less than two weeks later?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are in this chamber doing deals with the government over budget cuts that are going to have a negative impact on so many Queenslanders who can ill afford it. So, on the one hand they are saying they learnt their lessons but clearly they did not if they are prepared to do a deal with the government 10 days later to get these budget measures through that are going to have such a negative impact on the people of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding One Nation, think of Senator Hanson's political career. She has had a long political career of more than 20 years. For most of that time Senator Hanson has not actually been in parliament and has never actually had a vote that mattered. But in this chamber Senator Hanson and her colleagues do have votes that matter. I respect that they were elected democratically—I understand that. But when you have to front up here and vote we will hold you to account. So we make no apologies for vigorously holding Senator Hanson to account. We will do it on penalty rates and we will absolutely do it on the measures that are contained in this bill we are debating tonight, because we know what damage it will do to the most vulnerable Queenslanders, who are relying on the Labor Party to stand up for them. If only One Nation would do the same thing. With Senator Hanson and One Nation—her two other colleagues, and potentially three, when they get their Western Australian senator here—we will absolutely hold them to account on the votes that have here in the Senate. They have to explain themselves in this chamber and in the community as well. That is something we look forward to doing throughout the rest of this year and indeed as we get closer to an election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the detail of the measures in this bill, it is something that is of significant concern to Queenslanders. When you look at the history of One Nation and how they have performed, any time they have had elected representation, like we saw after the 1998 Queensland state election, any time they have had to take responsibility for voting in the parliament, they fracture. In Queensland in 1998 they had 11 MPs elected, but it did not even last 12 months. They disintegrated. They could have worked cohesively. They could not argue their case in parliament. That was a very similar situation—there was a minority Labor government. But One Nation could not hold it together. They had splits and people leaving and quitting very soon after that happened. So it is very clear that the responsibility that comes with being elected and having multiple people elected from your party has been too much for them historically and I think it will again prove to be too much for them, because they have to defend themselves from voting continuously with this harsh Liberal-National government that continues to pursue an ideological agenda of cuts that hurt vulnerable people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the details in this bill are of particular concern. Looking at some of the measures, I think it is really important to highlight the waiting period for parent payment and some youth allowance. The Liberals want to extend the one-week waiting period. Previously, they have been advocating for a five-week period, but we have been strong in our advocacy against that. That is something we will continue to fight. There is also family tax benefit B, which is a payment to help eligible families. The impact the measures will have will result in 1.5 million families being worse off, and almost 600,000 of these families are on the maximum rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at this from the Queensland point of view, particularly, how many of those families would also be relying on penalty rates? So think about this as a double whammy—this bill having a negative impact and then the penalty rates cut that is looming, unless we can change that in this chamber and in the other place. That is going to have a massive impact on those people who rely on penalty rates and on the family tax benefit. These are people on an income of less than $52,000 a year. These are people who are really struggling to keep their heads above water and this government is treating them in this way, firstly with this bill, but then down the track, looming over the horizon very quickly, are the cuts to penalty rates. These are the priorities of this government at the moment. It is clearly something that the Labor Party will continue to fight. While I thought that the Liberal and National parties would abandon the 2014 budget, it is surprising that I, as a newly elected senator, am continuing to debate those measures. But I am really proud of the stance the Labor Party took in 2014 and I am proud to continue that stance. I look forward to continuing to fight on this issue, not only tonight but over the next couple months and indeed as we get closer to a federal election.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:27</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. It appears the main aspect of this bill is the freezing of indexation for three years on most working age allowances and for parenting payment single, as well as the freezing of indexation for two years on family tax payments. It does not matter how you package the new social services bill, it still cuts almost $2 billion from Australia's most vulnerable families. In the four years it will take to raise almost $2 billion from families who need it most, a modest financial transactions tax on Australia's highest high-frequency share traders could raise four times that amount. We are wasting our time arguing over crumbs when 600 out of 1,500 companies do not even pay tax. The Liberal government wants to hand over $50 billion in tax cuts to their big-business mates, and that is a tax on profits, not revenue, so we know businesses are not losing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But do you know who is losing out in this deal? It is the everyday families who are struggling to make ends meet. If the government cuts $50 a fortnight from families, the government has cut the family's power budget or their insurance. On the other side of the tracks, high-frequency share trading companies will not even notice a 0.01 per cent or 0.1 per cent financial transactions tax. A financial transactions tax would have the capacity to raise $1.4 billion a year, with little impact to the economy, and it would fund the Liberal government's childcare reforms, and more, and that does not even include other economic reforms I have been talking about for more than two years now, which includes a 15 per cent death tax on estates worth more than $5 million and a cap on the capital gains tax exemption for houses worth more than $2 million. Combine those measures with a financial transactions tax and the government could be raising almost $10 billion a year of the budget, without taking from Australia's poorest families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Liberal government had the political courage to tie these measures to the childcare reforms instead of playing the game of: 'how much money can we get away with taking from poor Australians this time', we would not still be debating this bill. If the Liberal government had the political courage to tie these measures to the childcare reforms then perhaps they would have the funds to expand the childcare reforms to the children who need them most so they can access early childhood education and childcare. There are many families out there who have no desire to meet the generous activity test the Liberal government have proposed, and it is these children who need childcare the most. It is these children who are a part of broken homes, surrounded by devastating circumstances that no child should have to be subjected to, let alone live in. Twelve to 15 hours of child care a fortnight is not enough to rescue these children from their environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is established that disadvantage perpetuates disadvantage and that is why we are stuck in this intergenerational welfare cycle. We also know that the first five years of a child's life shapes their attitudes, health and wellbeing for the rest of their life. Intergenerational welfare will continue to be a burden on the federal budget unless we nip it in the bud right now. Spending money on our children and families now is an investment in Australia's future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Please do not take my word for it. Perhaps my colleagues would be persuaded by Harvard University research. In 2010, Harvard University's Center on the Developing Child released a document called <span style="font-style:italic;">Core Concepts in the Science of Early Childhood Development</span> that stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

Likewise learning, behaviour and both physical and mental health are highly interrelated throughout the life course. One domain cannot be targeted without affecting the others. The brain's multiple functions operate in a richly coordinated fashion. Emotional wellbeing and social competence provide a strong foundation for emerging cognitive abilities, and together they are the bricks and mortar that comprise the foundation of human development. The emotional and physical health, social skills and cognitive-linguistic capacities that emerge in the early years are all important prerequisites for success in school and later in the workplace and community.</span>

While positive stress … is an important and necessary aspect of healthy development, toxic stress is the strong, unrelieved activation of the body’s stress management system in the absence of the buffering protection of adult support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is supposed to support the Australian public and not be the source of toxic stress for families. I know that protecting family tax benefits for Australia's most vulnerable and providing a safe, positive environment for disadvantaged children on their own will not end intergenerational welfare dependency. We need a holistic approach, which is why I will be submitting a motion to the Senate encouraging the government to include the Cashless debit card in their May budget. My motion will note that, as per the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cashless debit card trial evaluation: wave 1 interim evaluation report</span> of February 2017, of the 66 per cent of CDC participants who reported drinking, gambling or taking drugs before or during the trial, 33 per cent reported a reduction in at least one of these behaviours. Thirty-one per cent of the participants indicated they had been able to save more money. Thirty-one per cent indicated they could care for their children much better. Thirty-one per cent logged an improvement in technology use. Forty-six per cent of non-participants said life in the community was better; only 18 per cent disagreed. Only six per cent of all participants explicitly raised stigma or shame associated with the CDC as an issue. Community leaders and stakeholders generally responded that they had seen an increase of between 32 and 56 per cent in ability to afford basic household goods, in ability to pay bills, and in nutrition, health and wellbeing.</span>

Excessive drinking contributes to crime, violence, antisocial behaviours and accidents. Adolescence is often characterised by rapid physical and psychological transition, experimentation and risk-taking behaviour. This includes illicit drug use, causing both short- and long-term mental and physical health issues. Those who participate in early drug use are more likely to continue with future illicit and problematic drug use.</span>

I will be calling on the government to support the inclusion in the upcoming May budget of a further rollout of the CDC for all persons 17 years of age and under who are on ABSTUDY, living allowance, assistance for isolated children, carer payment, disability support pension, parenting payment (partnered), parenting payment (single), special benefit, youth allowance, apprentice youth allowance, other youth allowance, and students across Australia on 1 January 2018.</span>

This bill affects Tasmanians disproportionately, and any money the government takes from families is money that is snatched from the engine that runs the Tasmanian economy, which is small business. Trickle-down economics does not work. When you give money to a multinational corporation, more often than not that money does not stay in the country; it is sent offshore. But, if you give some money to families, they spend it all in their local communities, keeping small businesses alive, keeping their doors open. They do their groceries at the IGA down the road, they buy their gifts from the cute little gift shop in town, and maybe they take their kids out for a hot chocolate and a trip to the cinemas once a month. For families living pay to pay, the family tax benefit forms a vital part of their household budget, and I cannot sit back and let the government make cuts to that.</span>

I want to tell you very quickly what happened to me when I was medically discharged from the armed forces in 2000. When I was medically discharged, I thought, 'No worries—the Department of Veterans' Affairs will help me get back on my feet and they will look after me.' That did not happen to me. So for me to be able to survive as a single mum with two kids I had no other choice but to go to Centrelink.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had worked. I had been serving at Rotary tables from the time I was 10. I was working at the speedway at 12 and I had my first job at Kmart when I was 14 years and nine months. I worked in nightclubs and I worked in a supermarket during that time. I took a gap year and went and worked in the real world. That is what I did. So you can imagine what it was like to me, how shameful it felt and how demeaning it was for me, to work my whole life to become a single mum living with two kids and to try to support them on a disability support pension.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During that period, times were tough. There were times when I had to say no to my son, who was great at football, great at athletics and great at basketball, and who had the vantage of being able to represent his state. I told him on two occasions, 'I'm sorry, mate, but you can't go because I can't afford for you to go.' At one stage there he was wearing football boots that were too small for him, from the winter beforehand, because I could not afford to get him some. He had to wait. There were times when I would sit in a corner and cry because I felt so ashamed. For two days, I did not know how I was going to put bread and milk on the table. There was a time when my fridge broke and for three weeks we lived out of an esky. I put the esky under the house, so the ice would last longer. That is what my life was like. There were three occasions where I could not afford my rego—for four weeks one time, six weeks another time and 10 weeks another time—and I drove around without a registered car. On two separate occasions, I drove around without a licence because I could not renew it.</span>

I struggled for another 12 months until I went into Nick Sherry's office and begged him to help me to get my super released. Nick Sherry was very good to me—former Senator the Hon. Nick Sherry. He got that money for me within three weeks. But I paid dividends for that, because there are no clauses in there to cover when you are sick or injured or in dire straits. You will still get taxed because you are taking it out early. I lost a great deal of my super. But in the meantime, at least it saved my house. It gave us a little bit more breathing space. Had it not been for the honourable Senator Sherry, then I can assure you, Madam Deputy President Lines, I would have gone bankrupt. That is what my life was like for seven years.</span>

But I can tell you that I was so far behind by the time that I won that case—and my money was backdated—that my bills had piled up. Seven years on a disability support pension; I sure as hell did not come out in front. This is what it is like. It is not a choice for many of us to be on welfare. It is shameful and it is embarrassing and it is bloody tough. But we do it not because we want to but because circumstances put us there.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For you take to more money off those people—you have no idea how bloody tough it is. Every little cent counts to those people. What you are doing is shameful. If you really realised the damage that you are continually doing to that part of society, you would stop doing it. I know you have not been through that so I am just asking you. But there are some of us in this place who have, and it was difficult in our lives and our kids paid the price for that, through no fault of our own. I just wish you would reconsider what you are doing. We are not living when we are like that; we are surviving. We are in a bloody war zone and we are surviving, and that is all we are doing—each day we are surviving. We are surviving to try and put bread on the table. We are surviving to try and make sure that our kids can get the basics in life. We are trying to make sure our kids are better, so our kids can go to decent schools if we want that choice. I was really lucky in some areas, and I thank St Brendan-Shaw College. When I got in very difficult situations, they allowed me not to pay school fees for three years for my children. But they let them stay there. I want you to know: that is what it is like to be at the bottom of the crap pile; for many of us, through no fault of our own.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:43</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. I have sat through this debate all day, and to be able to speak after Senator Lambie is such a stark contrast to the nonsense from Senator Roberts that I had to sit through earlier this evening. Here we have somebody who has been in this place a very short time, but he had the arrogance to talk about luminaries of the Australian Labor Party—to say that, 'they would been One Nation Prime Ministers,' was just astounding, to be quite frank—absolutely astounding. But I guess that is what happens in this place when you have a government that changes the order of business for the day and comes in with a new piece of legislation because it has done some dirty deal with the crossbenchers—at least some of them, like One Nation, which is really just a faction of the Liberal Party. Those on that side are the masterminds, yet again, of attacking some of the most vulnerable people in our community, but they are not in here debating this piece of legislation. They have left it to people like Senator Roberts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government are incompetent, dysfunctional and unable to govern this country with any sort of agenda. They have waited until the eleventh hour to do their dirty deal, to have the Xenophons of this world, along with One Nation, join with them to bring about these changes. They have done this deal. They have gone through a process today. We have been in this chamber. Labor senators and others on this side are supporting our position and opposing this legislation, but very few on that side have come into this place defending their government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017, which is what we were supposed to be debating, was originally announced in 2015. Since then, the government who are running this country have failed to recognise how out of touch they really are. They still do not understand that the budget of 2014 was so bad that it was rejected overwhelmingly by the community. But they still insist on bringing this type of legislation here before us. And they have done it at the eleventh hour. They expected my colleagues to come into this place, with little more than half an hour's notice, and debate this piece of legislation—and we had not even seen it. We did not even know what the details of it were. I expect very few on that side knew the details either, otherwise they would have been in here defending it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, this government knew that the omnibus bill would never, ever get support in this place. So they have had to run around, as I said, do a dirty deal and then make some sort of token gesture by having a few of their senators come into this place. It is not just Labor and people on this side of the chamber who were opposed to the omnibus bill. Women's groups and early childhood educators gave evidence to the committee that looked into the bill. We know that there is so much concern out in the community. The government have no idea, no understanding, of the effect that they are having on ordinary, everyday Australians, some of whom are doing it really tough, through no fault of their own; it is circumstances. Now some of the same people who are going to be affected by the cuts to penalty rates are going to get yet another slap by this government. This government will be remembered in this country as a government that had no vision, had no plan and had a leader with no soul. If he did, if he really understood what the Australian community were feeling, how they are hurting, what these cuts are doing to people, he would not be going down this track. This is not the man who went to the election promising so much to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side will always fight for those who are disadvantaged in this community. We will always fight for those on low incomes, the lowest-paid workers in this country. Inequality is at a 75-year high. Wages growth is at record lows. Underemployment is at record highs. There could not be a worse time to cut penalty rates or cut family tax benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government said that there would be no cuts to family payments in this new bill, but that is a complete and utter untruth. It is a lie. Once again, they are being totally dishonest with the Australian community. We know that $1.4 billion will be cut from the payments. Through this bill the Liberal government, as I said, will take away $1.4 billion from Australian families. This is actually a 2014 budget measure. Can you believe it? Here we are three years later and they are trying the same stunt. Today they have regurgitated another unfair 2014 budget cut to families. They want to freeze current family tax benefit rates for two years which means 1.5 million families will be worse off and more than two million children will be worse off. Many of these families are on the maximum rate of FTB Part A, which means that their household income is less than $52,000 per year. That is $52,000 a year to raise a family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the history of these cuts when they were first introduced with the budget of 2014 which became synonymous with unfairness. It was completely rejected by the Australian people. Labor opposed the cuts then and we will oppose those same measures today, tomorrow or next month. We always will because the Australian families who are struggling with their everyday living expenses, trying to manage their budget and balance it, are relying on us to protect them. They know that the government have failed them, not once, not twice, but every single time they bring in legislation to attack these families through cuts to health and education, and these families know that they have been let down and they rely on us on this side of the chamber and others to support them and to protect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's proposed freeze to indexation on family tax benefits in this bill means that families will not be able to keep up with the cost of living for two years. Costs of living are rising around the country, and people are struggling, as I said, to put food on the table and to send their kids on school excursions, and the list of concerns that we have goes on and on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It never ceases to amaze me how out of touch this government really are, that they do not listen and quite clearly do not learn, otherwise they would not continue to go down this road of cuts. They do not understand what social investment means because, if they did, they would not be going down this track. They do not understand what fairness means. This is not the United States, this is Australia where we believe in fairness and where we believe that we should help and give a hand up to those who are the most vulnerable. We on this side want to invest in people and we will never ever abandon them.</span>

You would think that the whole house revolves around me. Eight minutes of Senator Chisholm's speech was about One Nation and Pauline Hanson. I thought you were here to discuss what was happening in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me put forward a few facts. We talk about the battlers in this country. The Labor Party is supposed to be a party for the battlers. In 1936 my grandfather was on the executive of the Labor Party. He migrated from England. He was a carpenter and worked hard. He was part of the union movement and he believed in a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. I was brought up with that same attitude by watching my father work 106 hours a week for 25 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know what it is like to be a battler. I have come from a battling family, and watched my father work long hours. I started working in a shop serving at 12 years of age, and started a full-time job at 15 years of age. I know what it is like to be a battler. I had my first child at 17 years of age, and my second by the time I was 21. I was a single mother at 22 and having to work, so I know what being a battler is about. I found the money to put food on the table to feed my two children, and I made sure they could eat. So do not tell me about being a battler; I know.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that unless we pull back the deficit of this country, we will not have the money to support the aged, the sick and the necessary in future generations. What is happening? We need to get common sense into this debate, and we need to actually look at what is right for the people of Australia. For too long we have seen both sides of this parliament put the idea out there that they are going to give people extra benefits to get votes. When John Howard came into power, the budget was $96 billion in debt from Paul Keating's Labor government. John Howard and Peter Costello as Treasurer pulled it back, and when the Labor Party took over in 2007, it was in a $22 billion surplus. Under Labor, it went into a $400 billion deficit. Something has to give. The coalition has run up debt also, and, at the moment, by the debt clock, we are running at $547 billion. We cannot sustain this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts that are happening tonight in this budget have to be looked at in the sense of what they are going to do for Australia and for future generations. You cannot keep buying votes; make the tough decisions in this House, because that is what you have to do if you are going to be able to provide for future generations. You cannot keep giving out handouts all the time. It does not work. How many of you in this house have ever run a business? How many of you have ever employed anyone? Do you have any idea, or are you just career politicians? Most of you coming into this place would not even know what the hell you are talking about—</span>

In the last seven months—prior to that actually; a year before the election—I have travelled Queensland quite extensively. Senator Chisholm, where were you with the Singaporean land acquisition? Where were you with the cane growers? The people of Queensland would not even know who Senator Chisholm is, or who Senator Ketter is, or who Senator Watt is. They never see them. I never see them. No-one ever says anything to me. People would not even know who the Labor senators for Queensland are; would not have a clue! What are they doing for Queensland?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the WA election and the GST for WA, I will just put it on record—Senator Chisholm made a comment that I was taking money from Queensland. That is not the case. I said it is an unfair deal for WA, only getting 30 per cent of the deal for GST. It is not fair. Everything that I do and say, I look at what is fair right across the board for all Australians. It is not about taking money from Queensland, because we have a lot of other states that are getting far more GST. I am looking at things that are fair, and people would expect no less of me in my position as a senator in this parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk about the WA elections and the deal done. Labor cannot get away from it. I think Labor are concerned because they are not going to get preferences from One Nation at the next election. Let me tell you, it was the Labor state secretary who approached a member of my office to do a deal at the Queensland election. You are making comments about the WA election, but let me make it quite clear: Labor have approached us to run dead in some seats in Queensland. But you were not interested in that. You are making comments about this. The Labor Party are so hypocritical in this chamber that the people of Australia need to know this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Chisholm made a comment about me and my party in 1998. Let me tell you this: I actually had charges brought against me by Tony Abbott—sorry; it was not Tony Abbott. He funded Terry Sharples to bring charges against me. But it was the then Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, Labor Premier Peter Beattie, who then deregistered the party in Queensland, which forced the members of parliament to go and register another political party. And prior to my trial, it was Peter Beattie—Labor—who, instead of making it a six-month jail term or a fine, made it seven years so that the judge could convict me for up to seven years. He did that prior to my trial. This is Labor; you really are for the battlers. That is what I say to Senator Chisholm. Get your facts straight. If you are going to have a go at me, get them straight; know what you are talking about. He did not know what he was talking about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole thing about this, about when the Labor Party talk about the fight for the lowest paid—I am actually ridiculed over the rates. Isn't it quite interesting that Labor were the ones, under Bill Shorten, who brought in the 457 visa holders to more than 100,000? Where were they to protect the jobs in Australia? These 457 visa holders have taken up jobs in McDonald's, in Kentucky Fried Chicken and all these other places. I owned my own small business. If I owned my own business now I would have to pay the rates of $34 an hour, but if you work at McDonald's—this is great of the union bosses; they have done the EBAs—you only get paid $26 an hour. They are really looking after their workers! If you have a cleaning business in a small motel, you pay $31 an hour. You could pay possibly $10 less if you worked for a big chain, all through the unions and the EBA agreements. Labor are really looking after the workers in this country! You have done a fantastic job!</span>

Who opposed it? Labor. Where were you worrying about the battlers of this country? You were not. You were protecting the elites of this country. They did not need to be protected—they are former prime ministers on thousands of dollars—but you protected them. And you talk about the battlers.</span>

We have to pull in the budget, with a commonsense approach—work together on this and look at what is best for this nation. We have seen so much rorting going on. Labor is looking at the fact that we are freezing family tax benefit A and B. But Labor did the same. Labor froze the tax benefit increments indexed in 2011-12. They are hypocrites, absolute hypocrites, to actually do it. And now you are accusing the coalition of doing exactly the same. And then there are the multinationals. You complain about things—and I have heard it in this chamber—about the capital gains tax and the negative gearing, and you complain about all these things, the multinationals.

But where has Labor been on cost of living? It was actually Labor that allowed for foreign investors to do developments in Australia. In particular it was brought to my attention in Melbourne that if they did a development they could actually sell off the whole development to foreign investment. It used to be that 50 per cent had to go to Australians. Now the whole lot goes to foreign investors. Where was Labor on that? Where was Labor with Queensland now 87 per cent in drought? Where was Labor when multinationals put the squeeze on canegrowers in the Burdekin?—again, a foreign investor. And, as I said before, where was Labor with the Singaporean land acquisition? So, through you, Chair, I am asking these questions of Labor. Are they prepared to answer the questions? Where was Labor on creating affordable housing?</span>

Where were Labor when Senator Cory Bernardi put a freeze on politicians' wages in the budget? Labor are so hypocritical. Where was Labor on regional outback Australia where unemployment is at 11.6 percent in Queensland? Labor have made so many allegations against me that it is like the Medicare scare.

They know they are losing a lot of votes to One Nation because they are not standing up and fighting for the battlers in this country because they are two-faced.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:13</span>):  That was a rather extraordinary speech from Senator Hanson. If I could summarise it, in a nutshell it would be: 'Senator Hanson doesn't like being criticised in this chamber. Attempts to justify the cuts that One Nation are voting with tonight whilst pretending that they are on the side of the battler'. Then there was about 15 minutes on everything being Labor's fault. 'Absolutely everything that is happening is Labor's fault. Labor has not done enough in opposition to address some of the problems in this country and One Nation doesn't like being criticised.' Then we went back to defending One Nation's record on a bill that cuts money from over 1.5 million families in this country who will be worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On one level I sympathise with Senator Hanson because she is in the difficult position of trying to defend the indefensible. It was no wonder tonight that there was no attempt to actually explain why One Nation has walked hand in hand with the government yet again, as they do on every single vote that matters in this chamber, to make these savage cuts, to enforce these cuts without appropriate scrutiny from the Senate and to attempt to blame everything on the Labor Party. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a contrast Senator Hanson's contribution was following the speech of Senator Lambie tonight. Senator Lambie put a very human face to the impact that cuts like this have. It struck me today, when I was listening to members of the government defending this bill in the media and also making their contributions tonight in the Senate, how it is very easy to turn these matters that affect so many people in reality, when they are putting their budgets together at home, into some seemingly innocuous budget repair measure that is only saving $1.6 billion. They have all these big numbers and it is all about budget repair and how it has to be done; but what Senator Lambie did tonight was explain in very real terms about what that means for individual households and what the reality is for the vast majority of people in this country. I do not think those opposite ever have contact with them or have ever experienced the situations that these families will be placed in because of the cuts that are being rammed through tonight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak from some experience in this, as somebody who never, ever thought that they would rely on social security, welfare or income support. I never imagined that I would be in that position. To build on Senator Lambie's contribution, I went to university, I always worked, I had a reasonably comfortable childhood. It was never meant to happen to me that I would have to exist week by week on the sole parent pension. But in one week I went from being a member of a two-person household looking forward to the birth of my first baby, with reasonable paying jobs. After an accident one weekend I was a widow, pregnant, unable to work, looking for somewhere to live and without enough money to pay for a funeral for my partner. The unions that are so maligned in this place day after day helped me by fundraising to help me meet those immediate legal costs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I relied on the sole parent pension, then I relied on the healthcare card. I relied on childcare support when I had to go back to work part time to pay the rent and make sure that I could look after my daughter. That was my life for three years or so. I never thought it would happen to me, but I relied on the government of the day, on the Australian community, to have a social welfare system that looked after me when I needed it. It meant everything to me. Without that, I would have had to live with my parents. I cannot imagine what I would have done without that support. It does matter. I think how lucky I am now that I do not rely on that, but I also think of the importance behind protecting—it is not a lot that each household gets through family tax payment, but it is important to those families that to allow them to live a dignified life. It is very easy to package it all up and pretend it does not matter, but, speaking from experience, I can tell you that for those families it does matter—even if it is only stopping indexation. Every cost goes up. That matters to people. They rely on those small adjustments to make sure that they can live week by week. I have seen it time and time again. Even in an affluent city like Canberra, when you go past Uniting Care in Kippax and you see the mums with their kids—it is sometimes dads, but usually mums—lining up for their care packages, the petrol vouchers, the extra blankets in winter because the cost of heating your house here is so great because of the climate, you see that it is not only these payments that support people to get through; it is a whole range of other supports in our community. It is that sort of working together—the community sector with government payments, and with things like our high-quality education system, access to free hospital care and bulk-billing; all of those things—that allows us to live a much more equal lifestyle than many other countries across the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me today, listening to the contributions by government members, I think that we cannot just pretend that this does not have an impact or that it is the only choice available to government. We all accept that budget repair is important, but governments also have to accept that budgets and budget savings are all about choices. We over here would say that this is the wrong choice to make. It is the wrong choice to hit these families and to ask them to shoulder the burden disproportionately for budget repair at a time when the budget also allows for tax cuts for expenditure in other lines of the budget—for the generous tax concessions for negative gearing and capital gains tax, for example, that disproportionately go to the wealthier in our community. Those kinds of tax concessions should be the government's first point of call, not these families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are consistently told by this government that they have to shoulder the burden and that they have to do the heavy lifting. No wonder they are angry, when they look around and do not see anyone else doing the heavy lifting. We know from comments today by Senator Cormann that this is not the end, that there is more coming. This was confirmed, I think, on Sky News earlier today when it was put to the Treasurer about where all the old omnibus bills measures were. He replied, 'Well, those measures continue to stand as government policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So not only are these changes being rammed through tonight—and the crossbench have suckered up to this and accepted this; some may see it as an improvement on what was previously offered—the government has come out today, before this bill even passes, and said that the others still stand as government policy and they will be coming back in one shape or another. We would not see that as a significant win for the crossbench today. What they have done is to enable the government—they are the enablers—and the government is going to keep coming back, because none of these measures ever go away forever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to stand up for those families. We will continue to argue that the government should look for savings elsewhere and that those who need the most support should not have to shoulder the burden of budget repair disproportionately, as they are being asked to do in this bill tonight.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:22</span>):  Before I turn to the substance of the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 can I say two things? Firstly, can I acknowledge the very touching contributions from my friend and colleague Senator Gallagher, and also from Senator Lambie earlier. I think they really do merit remark, because they were both, in their own ways, very moving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I start on the bill itself, I did want to make a very brief response to Senator Hanson's interesting contribution. I would just make a couple of points. Senator Hanson spent time attacking the elites, but failed to explain in any detail, nor with any accuracy, her basis for supporting legislation that takes money from some of Australia's poorest people. She told people that she wanted to stand up for the battlers, whilst voting for, or agreeing to vote for, cuts to some of Australia's most vulnerable families. She told us all that we should do what is best for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I can say this to her: that is precisely the way in which the Labor Party has approached this bill and other pieces of legislation. We have agreed to budget measures and budget savings which we thought were reasonable, but we will not stand in this place and ask the most vulnerable families in Australia, and their children, to bear the brunt of this government's so-called budget repair, because it is certainly not budget repair that is fair and it stands in very stark contrast to the $50 billion worth of tax cuts for the corporate sector which remain at the heart of this government's policy. Well—at the moment it does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to talk a little bit about the government because, as we sit over here watching their antics—you would have to say the government are unmatched in their legislative incompetence since the ill-fated government of Billy McMahon—we think of many things. One man I have thought of is a man called Fiorello La Guardia. Who was he? Apart from having LaGuardia Airport named after him and creating New York's amazing skyline, La Guardia banned organ-grinders from the streets of New York. Whilst I have never had much affection for the organ-grinders, I have felt sorry for their monkeys. La Guardia did a good deal for monkeys, and I suspect that Mr Turnbull is desperately lamenting the fact that there is no La Guardia around to save him, because what a totally undignified position this Prime Minister finds himself in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what Mr Turnbull is? He is the monkey to the Abbott organ-grinder. This is where the carefully manicured Prime Minister finds himself—dancing to the tune played by his predecessor in the 2014 budget, because the proposed cuts to family payments, the bill before this chamber, is a return to the past. It is a return to the past that not only was repudiated by the Australian public but also ultimately led to the repudiation of its progenitor by his own party. Yet such is the power of Mr Abbott the organ-grinder that his monkey still dances to his tune.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This wretched Prime Minister and the motley crew that pass for his government want to rip $1.4 billion from the pockets of Australian families—families with young children and all the expenses that go to their care and their upbringing. For the most part, these are families whose finances are vulnerable and exposed as they face the rising cost this government has been totally unable to control. The revisions of this bill seek to freeze current family tax benefit rates for two years, and I would invite Senator Hanson to understand the difference between rates and thresholds. In effect, it wants to penalise those who are most exposed to cost pressures. It seeks to penalise around about 1½ million families and, with that, over two million children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abbott might have thought it was clever to take the cudgel to hardworking Australian families and make them fund budget shortfalls that this government is evidently unable to control, but the public made its position clear and he now sulks on the backbench. But I wonder if Mr Turnbull is set to discover he is headed for the same fate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an attack on at least 600,000 families whose household incomes are already less than $52,000 per year. These are the families who are already on the maximum rate of FTB Part A. This bill is not only an attack on those least able to bear a freeze on benefits but also a return to the 2014 budget. Remember that? The 2014 budget was a budget which has become legendary for its unfairness and for the regressive transfer of wealth from the less well-off to the very well-off. It may well have gone down well in the land of harbourside mansions where public transport is a fun thing to do on weekends, but let me tell you: it hits hard for those who live two or hours from their workplaces and for whom public transport is just part of the daily grind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is a party of social justice, fairness and equity, and that is why we have opposed these measures—this idea in the 2014 budget—when we forced the coalition to take it out of the budget and withdraw it from the parliament. We will continue to stand our ground. The payments that we are discussing tonight are designed to assist low- and middle-income families to cover the costs of their children and to alleviate child poverty. What the organ-grinder proposed in 2014, and what his monkey is now reintroducing, is a freeze to the indexation of payments that is there to enable less well-off families to meet rising costs of living—things like the cost of energy, the cost of utilities and the cost housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Turnbull used to represent himself as one who was full throated in his support for the basic social contract—that social contract which does hold our nation together. It is built on compassion and generosity, and it is deeply ingrained in a country which values mateship and values fairness. We help each other out. But the coalition is about the destruction of this social contract. Remember Joe Hockey? He used to drone on about lifters and leaners. Well, the sad fact is that this bill is proposed by the most inept political leaners this country has seen, and it actually hits the nation's lifters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not restrict its harshness to our less well-off families but extends it to working-age students as well as seeking a three-year freeze on the income-free areas for all working-age student payments. Not content with taking the cudgel to families, the coalition wants to go after jobseekers, single parents and students, and the proposed fees mean that these groups will be even less able to keep up with the cost of living. This is of particular concern for those on Newstart payments where there are already concerns about the adequacy of the payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with the 600,000 low-income families and their children that this bill focuses on, this bill wants to penalise another 204,000 Australians who are on the lowest incomes. This government's approach seems to be that, if you are going to be unfair, you may as well be indiscriminate as well. These are people who are already living on the poverty line, where the thresholds to be frozen are already incredibly low. This bill is an assault on the most financially vulnerable Australians. It has no basis in social justice, it has no basis in sound economic management and it has no basis in an equitable society. It is, quite simply, unfair. It is, quite simply, disgraceful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one piece of advice I would give to this Prime Minister is that he would be better off shaking loose the shackles that bind him to the former Prime Minister and the miserable ideas that fashioned the 2014 budget. Only then might this Prime Minister actually be able to get on with the business of governing. We are all still waiting for that. But, to do that, Mr Turnbull would need to understand that Australians place a high value on care and compassion when it comes to those who are doing it tough, and measures such as those proposed in this bill fly in the face of the common decency that Australians expect of their government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:31</span>):  As I stand here in the chamber this evening debating this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill, guillotined in the manner that it has been, I cannot help but think of the millions of children around the country that will be affected by these cuts. There are 1.5 million families and two million children that will be worse off. As previous speakers have highlighted, many of these families are on the maximum rate of family tax benefit A, which means that their household income is less than $52,000 a year. I ask senators in this place to contemplate what it means to live on an income like that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in Western Australia we have the highest unemployment rate in the nation. We have gone from having a very low rate of unemployment to a very high rate of unemployment. That means that these are the very families that have gone from earning an income to suddenly being dependent on this kind of income support. It is income support that is the social safety net and the social contract that Australians expect in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about what it might be like to have gone from a reasonably well paid job in mining at $120,000 or $185,000 a year with a mortgage and perhaps a partner who works part time and children to suddenly, as the primary breadwinner, losing your job and having those mounting mortgage payments and essentially be relying on an extraordinarily reduced household income that has no capacity to keep up with the cost of living. This is the very real situation of thousands of Western Australians currently. This is really rubbing salt into the wound of what is already a very difficult situation for families in Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, we know, is the resurrection of the 2014 budget cuts. Again, I am sure there are more insidious measures that the coalition put before this place then that they will again. When we are talking about the most vulnerable families in our nation, we on this side of the chamber will always stand up against these kinds of cuts. We do not want to see this $1.4 billion ripped out of the pockets of low-income Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I know we are talking about bringing the deficit down. We are talking about moving towards a balanced budget. This is the conversation that we are having about reducing debt. But you are exchanging that debt for household debt for the very poorest in our country, who have mounting credit card debt because, in times of crisis and in times of need, they turn to their credit cards, they pay the high interest rates and then they are stuck paying them off on these terribly low family payments. I know this because, within my own portfolio as shadow assistant minister for families and communities, I see the financial counselling services that are counselling families and I also see their emergency relief programs. These cuts are targeted at the very families who need our support the most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at families who access financial counselling, it is not because they have got extravagant lifestyles and it is not because they are necessarily bad at managing money. It is because they need someone to come in and help them renegotiate their debts, because essentially for the basic household expenses of rent, food, water, utilities and schoolbooks—all of the basic necessities of life—their income is not enough to meet these basic needs. When you look at people who access financial counselling and emergency relief, these are the families we are talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why things like the family tax benefit exist. It is to help low and middle income families cover the costs of their children, to alleviate child poverty and, frankly, to alleviate household stress. We have thousands of families around the country who deal with family and relationship support services. What are the things that drive family conflicts? Frankly, often it is money. It is the stress that comes with that. Often, it does not really matter how resilient or good your relationship is: when those stressful times happen with your household budget, then it can often mean trouble at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look to things like the proposal to freeze indexation to family tax benefits, it is extraordinary that what we are doing is actually mounting this increasing pressure on the environment within Australian homes—costs of energy, costs of groceries, costs of water, costs of housing and costs of rent. Essentially, you are saying as a government, 'We're going to allow these cost to keep rising, because that was what inflation does, but your household income will not rise.' That is why I am proud to stand on this side of the chamber to defend the lowest paid workers in the country, many of whom rely on family tax benefit to simply make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to call out these cuts for the rubbish that they are. Malcolm Turnbull has wanted us to believe that these cuts to vulnerable Australians are needed in order to deliver reform to child care, but that is simply not the case. They want us to believe that it is to support the budget, but I say to them that they have the wrong priorities. They are seeking to hand a $50 billion tax cut to corporate Australia while putting increasing pressure on household budgets for the Australians with the lowest incomes in our country. It is extraordinary to me when you consider how low the incomes are that we are actually talking about here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, I would challenge people to really look at how it is even possible to survive on the kinds of incomes that we are talking about here. For example, we know that when it comes to parenting payments, the threshold will be reduced to $188 per fortnight. There is absolutely no rationale, in my view, for this freeze for three years. For people who are relying on parenting payment, it is single parents that care for at least one child younger than eight years of age and partners that care for at least one child younger than six years of age below the threshold amount who are affected. These are parents who are struggling with children who are at the most vulnerable times in life, when you need that extra support to get them to school, when you need to be able to buy their schoolbooks, get transport to school and put food on the table. These are the very things that this bill attacks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just families, I would like to highlight, but students as well. Students and people on Newstart live on extraordinarily low incomes in our country. I thought it was hard enough as a student in the 1990s, but compared to today there is an extra onus on students to participate in the workforce. I do not think that is a bad thing, but I have to say time and time again I see people drop out of university because they simply cannot afford to go because they cannot balance a full-time study load with the kind of work they need to do to keep a roof over their head, petrol in their car and food on the table. These are exactly the people that you opposite are targeting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I really just want us to think about the combination that has been placed before us between this bill and robo-debt, through which you opposite have attacked thousands of ordinary, law-abiding Australians who have done nothing yet have been sent these debt letters. You have absolutely the wrong priorities. We will always fight for what matters to Australians: local jobs, protecting Medicare and building a strong economy that delivers for all. Most of all, we will always stand up to give a leg up to the most vulnerable Australians, unlike you across the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:42</span>):  I thank senators who have contributed to this debate. My remarks in closing this debate will be very brief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just deal with some of the remarks that have been made that by pausing indexation of family tax benefit payments somehow we are ripping money out of people's pockets. That is actually not true. Out of all of the savings options that we have been able to explore with relevant senators that were prepared to engage with the government, the judgement that we all made together was to pause indexation to ensure that every family will continue to at least receive the same level of payment that they are currently getting moving forward. No family will actually receive less as a result of the changes that are before us today. They will receive the same level of payment. Many of them will receive higher payments because relevant low-income eligibility thresholds will continue to be indexed. But nobody will actually receive less than they are receiving today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not something that was invented by the coalition and the crossbench; this is something Labor themselves in government have used several times. I heard Senator Pratt and Senator Wong in particular talking about the government ripping $1.3 billion out of families' pockets. I will just point to two examples, but there are many more from the Labor years in government. In 2009-10, the Rudd Labor government, with Mr Swan as Treasurer, delinked the indexation of FTB part A payments from pension indexation arrangements. That is, they lowered the level of indexation, which in 2009-10 dollars saved about $1 billion over the then forward estimates. The $1 billion over the 2009-10 forward estimates is actually more than what we are talking about with the indexation pause now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more. Labor paused all indexation of all FTBA and FTBB supplement payments—not thresholds, as Senator Wong was addressing to Senator Hanson. Labor paused all indexation of all FTBA and FTBB supplements—not for two years but, wait for this, for a total of six years, in their 2011-12 and 2013-14 and 2015 budgets, saving well over $1 billion in 2011-12 and 2013-14 dollars, respectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, just on those two measures, where Labor reduced the level of indexation—using Labor's language here today—Labor in government ripped money out of the pockets of Australia's most vulnerable families. We never said that then, because it was not true then—and Senator Pratt, it is not true today. What we are doing here, by pausing indexation, is the way to ease the necessary saving by spreading the effort across the broadest possible base in order to ensure that we can make this investment in additional support for families needing to access more affordable, more flexible childcare arrangements. And of course, as you know, those childcare reforms are particularly designed to improve and boost supports available for low- and middle-income families in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I reject the criticism. I do not want to be partisan at this late hour, but in the context of what you did yourself in government, to criticise what we are proposing to do here with the sort of rhetoric that you have been pursuing today is just not reasonable. I would even call it hypocritical. With those few words, I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard all of the debate tonight, and I think the debate has been very good, especially from Senator Lambie and Senator Gallagher, who have actually experienced relying on social security to help them and their families. Not too many in this place would have had to rely on that position, and that is why Labor sees social security as absolutely essential to have a decent society in this country. That is why we are opposed to this bill, because this is not the end of the cuts that this government is proposing. I am not sure if, in the negotiations that took place between One Nation, Senator Xenophon and Senator Hinch, the government indicated that this was only the first tranche of cuts to social security in this country. I listened to Senator Cormann when we were discussing the bill today, and this is what he said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">'These measures have been around for so long—why are you persisting with them?' But the government is persisting with them. The government is continuing to seek to legislate, and it is true that we have worked with crossbench senators because Labor and the Greens in relation to these measures were not prepared to pursue further budget repair, even though it was necessary, given the mess Labor left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know what you would call the fiscal and economic position that you are in at the moment, but what we are not prepared to do is simply deal with budget repair at arm's length from the implications it has for ordinary families in this country. Senator Cormann said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today is the next instalment. Building on the progress that we made in the initial omnibus savings bill, we will be able to secure more savings today. There will be more work to do after today, but this is as far as we believe the Senate will be prepared to go on this occasion, and that is what we are putting forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what this government has clearly said is that this not the end. No doubt what it really wants to do is go back to the 2014-15 budget and actually implement all of the so-called budget repairs, at the expense of the social security system in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not only Senator Cormann who raised this position today. It was also the Treasurer, Mr Morrison. He was asked on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span> by Peter van Onselen: 'There are a whole series of saving measures that were in the old omnibus bill that are not in the new one. What is the status of those?' Morrison said, 'Well, these are measures that continue to stand as government policy.' So we have got both Senator Cormann and Treasurer Morrison saying they want to pursue those zombie measures. Let us just remind ourselves what those measures are: cuts to paid parental leave, where 70,000 mums will be worse off; scrapping the energy supplement; a billion dollar cut to pensioners, people with disability, carers and Newstart recipients; a five-week wait for Newstart, forcing young people to live off nothing for five weeks before they can access income support; cuts to young people between the ages of 22 and 24 by pushing them off Newstart onto the lower youth allowance—a cut of around $48 a week, or almost $2,500 a year; scrapping the pensioner education supplement and education entry payment; and cutting the pension to migrant pensioners who spend more than six weeks overseas. That is the government's next tranche. They are not giving up on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the view that they have not given up what they wanted to do in the 2014-15 budget. They thought the 2014-15 budget was so good that they cracked out the Havana cigars and the red wine. They thought it was brilliant. Senator Cormann and the then Treasurer, Joe Hockey, clapped each other on the back about what a great job they had done. But what this does is it freezes payments. For ordinary families that freeze is the difference between keeping their car on the road, getting a new battery for the car or fixing up a couple of bald tyres and registering their kids in community sport. It is the difference between paying fees for a bit of soccer—keeping the kids in the game with everyone else—or paying for a school camp or buying small gifts at Christmas and birthdays. It means living in hope that the washing machine does not clap out and that the fridge keeps running, but maybe having a few dollars there to help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is not the only thing this government is doing. We have to see this in the context of what they want to do. They want to go back to the 2014-15 budget, and, in my view, they also want to go back to a position where penalty rates are cut across all awards in this country. If penalty rates disappear in this country, we will end up like the United States of America: we will have no decent underpinning to pay rates in the country; we will have no penalty rates on the weekend; people will depend on tips; and, when they need social security, social security will not be there for them. That is where we are with this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Senator Hinch, I say to One Nation and I say to Senator Xenophon: if you agree to this tonight, it is only the start. I am not sure if you were told it is only the start, but it is. That is where we are: where the working poor, the unemployed, the sick and the needy in this country are pushed to the side for an American system. That is why we say: 'Enough is enough. We are not prepared to support this bill.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the words that you hear from Senator Cormann are about how it does not really affect anyone and how no-one will lose any money—but they will lose money. This is only the first attack. The attacks will continue from this government. It is outrageous that Senator Hinch, Senator Xenophon and his team, and One Nation—well, what do you say about One Nation? They will just do whatever this government does. They used all the Liberal talking points. Senator Hanson used all the Liberal talking points very badly, I must say, in her contribution. But she is the same as any other Liberal member. As I said tonight, she really should close the circle and she should apply to rejoin the LNP Queensland, because that is where she belongs; that is where One Nation belong. If there are any working class people who think One Nation will help them, well, have a look at Senator Roberts, who comes in here attacking the only institution outside the progressive party, the Labor Party, that looks after working people; continually attacking the trade union movement. If the guy had any sense, which we know he doesn't, if he had any comprehension, which we know he doesn't, if he had any feelings for ordinary working people, which we know he doesn't, he would not be coming in here making the speeches he makes—absolutely obnoxious speeches, outrageous speeches. He has no grasp of what it means to be a welfare recipient—someone who is poor and someone who is needy. He absolutely deals in fairytales off the internet. He runs all that rubbish in here and says they are going to be a party of the future. Well, if that is the party of the future, this country is doomed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will maintain one aspect of the bill: they will get rid of that first tranche—that is what it is, the first tranche—of attacks on social security in this system. We know what the second tranche will be: the zombie features from that last omnibus bill. Then you will see us going back to the original 2014-15 budget, and if you add on top of that cuts to penalty rates, then the living standards of the poor people in this country will be decimated. I ask that amendments (4), (5) and (6) on sheet 8104 standing in my name be dealt with now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">23:07</span>):  I propose to speak briefly on behalf of the government in relation to all of the amendments that Labor have circulated on this bill. The government does not support the amendments moved by Senator Cameron on behalf of the opposition. The effect of the amendments he has circulated would reduce the savings generated from this bill from about $1.7 billion over the current forward estimates to just $30 million over the current forward estimates period. Agreement to these amendments would put at risk the savings the government has identified to facilitate the important childcare reforms to be delivered. The opposition are opposing savings measures that are fair and reasonable. Indeed, they are opposing savings measures that they themselves in the past have pursued. Opposing indexation in schedules 1 and 4 is a lever, indeed, that has been used by successive governments, including Labor in government, to realise budget savings by slowing the growth in social security expenditure. Again, I confirm that nobody will end up receiving less in dollar terms. They just will not receive the same level of indexation. </span>

If you want to check it out, that was in the Labor 2011-12 and 2013-14 budgets, and that was on top of reducing indexation for all family tax benefit A payments in Labor's 2009-10 budget, which was saving you back in 2009-10 about a billion dollars over the then forward estimates period. When Labor pursue these sorts of savings in government, we would say it is a sensible way to do it. When Labor pursue these sorts of savings in government, Labor describe them as sensible fiscal management. When we pursue these sorts of savings in government in order to reinvest the money in a very important reform, Labor come out with all their rhetoric on how we are cold-hearted and how this is nasty and terrible, and how we are ripping money off families. We are not ripping money off families. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current regular superannuation and income stream review process will be automated by requiring income stream providers to provide recipient data on income streams directly to the Department of Human Services. This change will apply to all income streams, including account-based income streams, term annuities and defined benefit income streams. The outcomes of this policy will be reduced red tape and regulatory costs for income support recipients. So it seems better for income stream recipients and income stream providers through reducing double-handling and the need for income stream providers to provide information to recipients, which they in turn have to provide to DHS. This is a measure that really makes the system more user-friendly, both for the DHS clients and for the relevant providers.</span>

Essentially, this will reduce future customer debts through the provision of more accurate data.

It is the same number of families who were impacted by the freeze of the reduction of the indexation arrangements over an extended period for all family tax benefit A payments in the 2009-10 budget.

The measure does apply to the maximum standard base rate and approved care organisation rate of family tax benefit part A and the maximum rate of family tax benefit part B. The lower income free area would continue to be indexed. That is an important point which means, depending on your level of income, you will actually continue to receive increases in payments, just not because of indexation in payment rates but because you move past certain eligibility thresholds.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All 1.4 million family tax benefit families will be affected by this measure, but that is actually the advantage because it means that the impact to achieve the $1.3 billion saving is minimised and that is precisely why Labor has pursued similar measures in the past. The family tax benefit rates—this is important to say—are not being reduced. Families will continue to receive assistance at current rates for another two years at least. Some families will receive more depending on their personal circumstances. In 2017-18, families receiving family tax benefit part A will forego increases of up to around $73 per child under 13 or around $91 per child aged 13 and above. It is important to also recognise that this proposal would not disproportionately affect regional Australians.</span>

What I can say is that no family will receive less as a result of this saving than they are currently receiving. Every family will at least get the same amount they are currently receiving for the next two years, all other things being equal. If they end up earning more money, the means test obviously will kick in. If they earn less money they might qualify for a higher rate of payment. If their kids grow older, as kids do, then obviously progressively they are entitled to a higher payment. So there are various factors that come into play, and I am not able to assist Senator Siewert with the specific question she is asking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I would make again is that in terms of achieving savings in this space there is a reason Labor did this in government before. Senator Wong quite unfairly criticised Senator Hanson for her contribution. Senator Hanson was quite right. Labor in government froze the indexation of family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B supplement payments not for two years but for six years, and saved about $1 billion on that. In 2009-10 Labor delinked the indexation of all family tax benefit A payments from the pension indexation arrangement, saving, in 2009-10 dollars over the then forward estimates, about $1 billion. Of course, $1 billion in 2009-10 is significantly more now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what Labor decided to do at a time when we were, quite frankly, compared to now, in a higher inflation environment. We are in a low-inflation environment. To pause indexation in the current circumstances, we believe, is a fair and reasonable way to release the necessary savings in order to be able to invest in the very high-priority childcare reforms, which are of course geared to provide better, more targeted support and more flexible and affordable access to child care for working families.</span>

So the same mob that is saying this is not a cut when they are taking $5.5 billion worth of funding out of the family tax benefit—they do not call it a cut—are now saying: 'Trust us, some families will see an increase, but we can't tell you how many. Just believe us.' Not being able to find some detail earlier, I actually did ask the library to look at this and see what they thought of it. They thought that a small number of people will go from the reduced maximum rate to the maximum rate, and a very small number of people will in fact benefit. That is their take on this. That was after this was tabled. I was thinking that you may have more detail about this, Minister.</span>

That will give you a flavour as to why this is not entirely straightforward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, we have a family of two parents, with one working full time on $83,000 per annum and the other working part time on $20,000 per annum—so a household income of $103,000 per annum—with two kids aged 10 and 15. Under current arrangements they would obviously receive family tax benefit payments at the lower level of $28.80 in 2016-17, which would increase to $40.31, $59.28 and then $79.78 under current arrangements. Under the revised arrangements with the pause in place, these payments would still increase per fortnight, from $28.80 to $34.42, $42.28 to $61.39. The reason for that is the rate of family tax benefit A continues to increase despite indexation pauses to payment, although by less. This is because the threshold for the income test, which reduces the maximum rate of family tax benefit A, still gets indexed and continues to increase year on year, therefore reducing the amount that is lost to the taper rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you a second cameo, this one at the lower end. There are two parents, with one working full time on $41,000 per annum and the other working part time on $9,000 per annum, so the household income is $50,000 per annum. There is an assumption that income does not increase, with the $50,000 household income being below the level at which maximum rates of family payments are reduced under the taper rate. There are two kids, aged 10 and 15 years old. Again, I will run you through the numbers: at present, under current arrangements that family would get $503.68 this financial year, $511.68 the next financial year, $523.47 the following year and $535.55 in 2019-20. Once the pause is in place, the payments will still increase, though by less—from $503.68 to $504.24 to $505.36 to $517.16. This is because, as this family is receiving the maximum rate of family tax benefit A, their family tax benefit A remains fixed at the same nominal level, but the rate of family tax benefit B continues to increase as the threshold for the income test on the lower income, which reduces the maximum rate of family tax benefit B, continues to be indexed, therefore reducing the amount that is lost to the taper rate. You can see this on page 5 of <span style="font-style:italic;">A guide to </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">government payments</span>, which I am sure you are familiar with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there is a third cameo. It involves two parents, one working full time on $56,000 per annum and the other working part time on $9,000 per annum. The story is pretty similar. Household income is $65,000. There is an assumption that income does not increase, which, of course, would have other implications. They have two kids who are 10 and 15 years old. Under the current arrangements the payments would be $402.93 this year, followed by $416.55 next year, $436.20 the following year and $456.70 in 2019-20. That is under the current indexation arrangements. With the pause, these payments will still increase—from $402.93 to $409.11 to $418 09 to $438.31.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are typical cameos, but there are many moving parts in these things. Every family is different, every family has its individual circumstances, so every family will be impacted in a slightly different way. But what I can say to you is that no single family will be receiving less in family tax benefit payments as a result of this pause in indexation than they are receiving this year. No family will be receiving less as a result of this legislation. We are only pausing the indexation of payment rates. That is something that Labor has done in the past for various payments over much longer periods, and for higher savings in today's dollars.</span>

You just want people out there to believe that some people are still going to receive an increase. In the second reading speech you also talked about $5.5 billion being saved from the family tax benefit changes over the medium term. I presume that is factoring in the fact that family payments will not increase as much as they would have done over that period. What term do you mean by 'the medium term', and is the $5.5 billion correct?</span>

There was one thing that I particularly wanted to answer. If we are pausing indexation for two years, indexation will then start again from 1 July 2019 onwards. But it will be starting from the new base which has not been indexed for two years. There will be indexation moving forwards, but we do not catch up on the indexation that has not happened for the two years during which the indexation has been paused, so indexation from 2019 onwards will be from a lower base than it otherwise would have been, which is why there is a follow-on effect that comes to $5.5 billion over an 11-year period.</span>

You know why Clive Palmer and PUP did not survive? I will tell you why they did not survive. It was because Clive did dirty deals with the Libs. He stopped doing what he had said he would do for the battler. He was full of it just like One Nation is.

They will get better access to more affordable and more flexible child care, in particular, geared towards providing better support to low- and middle-income families. We are, of course, substantially responding to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission in terms of how that should best be done to ensure that there is downward pressure on the increases in costs of provider-driven child care, and the reforms are there for everyone to see.</span>

                    </a>  I hear a comment from the crossbenchers. What I have actually said in the past is that we should pull in the multinationals to make them pay their fair share of tax in Australia. I am trying to get a balance here. We can start to rein in the debt. If we do not start to rein in the debt we will not be able to look after the pensioners, the aged, the sick and the needy. You cannot keep giving and giving and giving. It does not work that way. We need to start being balanced in our views in this house. We are the leaders of this nation. Start working together. That is what the people of this nation want. Stop being so negative in what you are doing here. The people are listening and watching. And, as I have said, do not criticise me. I remember that it was just a couple of days ago, or maybe it was even yesterday, when I said that there should be a freezing of politicians' wages until we bring this budget back into surplus. Where were you? Where was Labor? Where were you on the other side of the chamber? You worry about your own pay packets. You do not care about the battlers or the people of this nation. You are a bunch of hypocrites—absolute hypocrites! That is what I say to you. Start looking at yourselves in the mirror, because you are bringing this country down. Start realising that we are the leaders of this nation. Show by example and start reining back in. Stop saying that people, putting a blanket over everyone, are the battlers of this nation. Look at who are the battlers. People are ripping off this system here. Don't you understand that there are people in this country who are truly battlers? We need to look after them.

It is extremely hard for them to hold a job in this country. I am sick and tired of hearing the Labor Party go on about jobs, when they do not protect the workers in Australia. We need to look at this bill in the right perspective. I think it needs to be reined in. We are not in a vote. I have listened to the minister tonight in his delivery. Those families on tax benefits A and B are not going to be affected. Nothing is going to happen. They are not going to lose their benefits for the next two years. They are not losing their benefits. Nothing is going to change. </span>

I note that the bill introduces a waiting period for new payment for different payment types. I am concerned that you are also playing with the definition of severe financial hardship versus experiencing a personal financial crisis. If you are introducing a waiting period, for example for parents who are experiencing a relationship breakdown, how do you differentiate between a financial crisis and financial hardship? For example, hardship might be a household with a mortgage, but a crisis might be someone who needs to break up a rental household and find a new rental. But it really does seem that you are putting in place a waiting period of one week with families at their most vulnerable time, while not having a clear definition of hardship versus financial crisis. I am very concerned that families will be left vulnerable.</span>

I can understand hardship might be over an ongoing period and a crisis might be unexpected expenditure, which might be related to needing to move house or the kinds of things that happen when families break up, but I am seeking reassurance that families who might be to move house—et cetera—will not be subject to this insidious, terrible one-week waiting period.</span>

They understood that the government needed to identify savings in order to pay for it. We were able to reach an agreement on which savings they might be prepared to support. Obviously, there was a whole range of savings that they were not prepared to support. We reached agreements on those that they were prepared to support and that is reflected in this bill that we have introduced today.</span>

There are some small variations between cash and fiscal, but that is it, essentially, broadly.</span>

The only thing that South Australians and Tasmanians fight about is who has the biggest unemployment for the month, who is the poorest for the month. For the people of South Australia and the people of Tasmania we would like to know what deal you have done with the Nick Xenophon Team to take from the poor. I would remind you that that is why your Three Amigos are no longer in Tasmania. I would expect that, in the next federal election, if you continue this behaviour, which is a bad pattern of behaviour, you are going to lose more. If you could please answer the question so that those in South Australia and those in Tasmania know what sort of filthy, dirty deal you have done to push the poor further into the ground. You owe it to them. Grow a spine!</span>
