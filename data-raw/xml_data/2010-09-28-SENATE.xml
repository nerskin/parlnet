<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>

<type>Governor-General's Speech</type>
</debateinfo>
<para>Her Excellency the Governor-General entered the chamber and, being seated, with the President on her right hand, commanded that a message be sent to the House of Representatives intimating that Her Excellency desired the attendance of honourable members in the Senate chamber.</para>
<para>Honourable members having come with their Speaker, Her Excellency was pleased to deliver the following speech:</para>
<para class="bold">Introduction</para>
<para>Honourable senators and members of the Parliament of Australia, I honour the traditional owners of the country upon which we gather and celebrate our Indigenous peoples as the first lawgivers of our land.</para>
<para>I also acknowledge the remarkable circumstance of our nation having its first female Governor-General and first female Prime Minister.</para>
<para>This historic conjunction should be an inspiration not only to the women and girls of our nation but to all Australians.</para>
<para>It demonstrates this is a land of freedom and of opportunity. It should reinforce to every girl and every boy that in this wonderful country they can aim high and see their hopes fulfilled.</para>
<para>It is also evidence that our democratic system is strong, with our established principles of government ever adapting to meet new challenges and new demands.</para>
<para>Nowhere has the robust nature of our democracy been more evident than in the election held on 21 August 2010.</para>
<para>Through this result, the Australian people have placed upon their elected leaders the responsibility of forming a minority government, something not seen in our Commonwealth for seven decades.</para>
<para class="bold">Parliamentary reform</para>
<para>It is a tribute to every senator and member gathered here today that this process unfolded with patience and civility and has yielded a parliament committed to greater transparency and accord.</para>
<para>In that spirit, the government will quickly implement new measures to enhance the dignity and effectiveness of this legislature, including a more effective question time, a stronger committee system and greater scope for private members’ bills.</para>
<para>The government will also facilitate the creation of a Parliamentary Budget Office and the new role of Parliamentary Integrity Commissioner.</para>
<para>It is the government’s intention that these reforms will not only serve for this current term but become an enduring legacy to our parliamentary system.</para>
<para>The government will also bring forward for early consideration legislation to ensure that political donations are made more transparent and risks to the integrity of our political system are minimised.</para>
<para>Of great significance in this term will be proposals to amend the Constitution to recognise the first Australians and to acknowledge the role of local government in our democratic system.</para>
<para>The recognition of Indigenous Australians in our founding charter will be a high point on our nation’s long journey towards reconciliation, which began with the historic referendum of 1967.</para>
<para>More broadly, the government recognises that the parliament will play a much enhanced role in the governance of our nation during this term and welcomes the opportunity thus presented to strengthen our democracy.</para>
<para>Within this more cooperative framework, the government looks forward to implementing policies that will equip our nation to meet the demands and challenges of the twenty-first century.</para>
<para class="bold">A stronger economy</para>
<para>Foremost among those challenges is the need to build a high-productivity, high-participation, high-skill economy that delivers sustainable growth for all Australians.</para>
<para>Having emerged from the global financial crisis with some of the best economic outcomes of any advanced nation, the government will implement measures to ensure Australia’s economy remains flexible and strong.</para>
<para>At the heart of these plans is the government’s commitment to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13, placing Australia at the forefront of global fiscal consolidation efforts.</para>
<para>The government will advance its economic reform agenda to lift productivity and competitiveness and prepare for the future, through reforms to taxation, superannuation and business regulation, and through investments in education and infrastructure to drive future growth.</para>
<para>During this term, the government will pursue plans to reduce the tax burden on the business sector, simplify tax returns for ordinary taxpayers and obtain a more equitable distribution of the nation’s natural wealth through the minerals resource rent tax agreed with our nation’s biggest miners and now the subject of wider consultation.</para>
<para>Further deliberations on the nation’s taxation system will be considered at a public forum to be held by mid 2011, which will re-examine the Henry tax review and consider the economic and social effects of taxation reform.</para>
<para>Following that forum, the government will hold a debate on tax reform in the Australian parliament, enabling all senators and members to express their views.</para>
<para>In the coming term of office, the government will also commence implementation of its promised increase in the superannuation guarantee levy from nine to 12 per cent, ensuring working Australians enjoy greater security in retirement and considerably boosting the nation’s pool of savings.</para>
<para>In parallel, the government will seek to implement key findings of the Cooper review to make the nation’s superannuation system more efficient, cost-effective and transparent.</para>
<para>During this term, the government will also pursue its reform agenda to break down barriers for businesses operating across state and territory borders, in particular, a national regime for occupational health and safety regulation.</para>
<para>Another central aspect of the government’s economic strategy is continued high levels of infrastructure investment, which will help drive productivity and make our cities more liveable.</para>
<para>To this end, the government is investing $37 billion in transport infrastructure through the Nation Building Program over the six-year period to 2013–14.</para>
<para>The government’s commitments include major urban rail projects in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, the most significant investment in public transport yet made by the Commonwealth.</para>
<para>In this term of parliament, the government will also continue the rollout of Australia’s largest ever infrastructure enterprise, the National Broadband Network.</para>
<para>By making high-speed affordable broadband available to the whole community, the NBN will help lift the productivity of our regional economies, expand economic opportunities and improve service delivery in key areas such as education and health care.</para>
<para>The NBN will also underpin the government’s commitment to provide, from 1 July 2011, a new Medicare rebate for internet based consultations for those living in regional and outer suburban areas where access to medical specialists is limited.</para>
<para>Accordingly, the government will present for consideration by this parliament legislation to enable the effective rollout of the NBN, support the heads of agreement with Telstra and improve the existing regulatory regime.</para>
<para>The Australian government is deeply committed to ensuring that the dignity and benefits of work are more widely shared among the members of our community.</para>
<para>Therefore, the government will pursue measures to increase workplace participation by disadvantaged or disengaged groups, including Indigenous Australians, people with disability, youth and mature age workers.</para>
<para>This will include the introduction of a work bonus for age pensioners who choose to undertake part-time work, and training and assessment support for mature age workers.</para>
<para>The government will also bring forward a range of new measures to drive positive employment outcomes, including relocation assistance to support the long-term unemployed move to areas with greater job opportunities.</para>
<para>With the economy returning to above-trend growth, the government acknowledges the cost of living pressures faced by many families.</para>
<para>In response, the government has already introduced three tranches of income tax reductions and has increased the Child Care Rebate from 30 to 50 per cent.</para>
<para>In addition, the government’s historic Paid Parental Leave scheme will commence on 1 January 2011, assisting families with the cost of raising children and encouraging greater workforce participation.</para>
<para>To provide further assistance to families, the government will extend the scope of the education tax refund to cover the cost of school uniforms.</para>
<para>In addition, the government will increase family support by up to $4,000 a year for teenagers who are enrolled in school or vocational training, encouraging young people to remain in the education system and acquire the skills necessary for work and for life.</para>
<para>The government will better protect employee entitlements as part of its commitment to fair and balanced workplace relations, and measures will be introduced to enhance the protections available to banking customers.</para>
<para class="bold">Education</para>
<para>Honourable senators and members, education lies at the heart of the government’s agenda to strengthen workforce participation and enhance our nation’s fairness and prosperity.</para>
<para>The government will continue to build on its landmark reforms in early childhood education, schools, vocational education, universities and research.</para>
<para>In each area the government will continue to improve standards and quality, increase transparency and modernise infrastructure.</para>
<para>During this term, in the area of school education, the government will empower local principals and communities to make decisions on the ground to improve the quality and effectiveness of their schools.</para>
<para>At the same time, the government will deliver the national curriculum and build on its My School transparency measures.</para>
<para>In addition, parents, students and teachers will be provided with a national online assessment and learning bank to help support learning and diagnose individual student strengths and learning needs.</para>
<para>There will also be new recognition and rewards for schools that improve attendance and student performance, and the very best classroom teachers will be identified and rewarded through a new national system of performance assessment and bonus payments.</para>
<para>The government will also move to ensure Australian students have access to a national educational credential of international standing—the Australian Baccalaureate.</para>
<para>To help ensure children are ready to learn when they start school, the government will continue to deliver its early education reform agenda and enable universal access to preschool by 2013.</para>
<para>The government will link payment of the family tax benefit part A end-of-year supplement so that four-year-old children receive a health assessment before starting school.</para>
<para>In the area of skills development, which is so critical to our nation’s future, the government will continue its reform efforts to create a truly national, high-quality, transparent training system and to lift the skills of the workforce.</para>
<para>The government will build on the trade training centres program with a new national trade cadetship initiative to help young people develop trade skills while they are enrolled at school.</para>
<para>Additional incentives and mentoring will also be provided to ensure that apprentices gain the skills and experience relevant to the industries of today and the future.</para>
<para>The government will introduce a guaranteed entitlement to high-quality training places for all Australians under the age of 25, and in the future will develop a broad entitlement for foundation skills training and skills development for older Australians.</para>
<para>During this term of parliament, legislation will be introduced to establish new quality and standards regulators in higher education and vocational education.</para>
<para>Given the vital role of universities in driving productivity, research, innovation, regional development and the social and cultural life of the nation, the government will continue to deliver its transformative reform agenda stemming from the Bradley and Cutler reviews and the considerable new funding associated with these reforms.</para>
<para>The government will also seek to reintroduce university student amenities and services legislation to enrich the learning experience and wellbeing of students across Australia.</para>
<para class="bold">A fair and resilient society</para>
<para>Honourable senators and members, over the next term, the government will strive not only to build a stronger economy but a more inclusive society.</para>
<para>Despite Australia’s strong economic growth, around five per cent of working age citizens experience multiple forms of disadvantage that can result in lower levels of social and economic participation and reduced wellbeing.</para>
<para>The government’s second term social inclusion agenda will thus focus on overcoming entrenched disadvantage so that as the economy grows, fewer people are left behind.</para>
<para>To achieve these objectives, the government will continue to invest in our health system and schools, our communities and regions to support social inclusion and close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage.</para>
<para>The government will implement its landmark structural reforms to improve access to health and hospital services for all Australians and sustain the financial viability of the health system.</para>
<para>The government will also expand the rollout of GP superclinics in suburban and regional communities, and create a GP after-hours hotline so families can receive support on weekends or late at night.</para>
<para>On mental health, the government will fund a package to help reduce the incidence of suicide and will work towards new measures to further improve the health of Australians living with mental illness.</para>
<para>The government will also fund additional aged-care places and invest in multipurpose services that provide integrated aged health and aged-care services.</para>
<para>Over the next four years, the government will invest in increasing participation in community sport and supporting our elite athletes, thus contributing to a more active and healthy society.</para>
<para>Indigenous communities will benefit from the government’s continued investment in housing, health, early childhood, economic participation and remote service delivery, with outcomes closely tracked against ‘Closing the Gap’ targets.</para>
<para>The government’s agenda for Indigenous advancement will also be strongly supported by the establishment of the National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples to be convened from January 2011.</para>
<para>The government is committed to ensuring that this term of office delivers tangible improvements in the level of support for those who live with disability.</para>
<para>The government will increase the number of supported accommodation places, and will finalise the National Disability Strategy through the Council of Australian Governments.</para>
<para>It will also provide individual funding for early intervention services to assist children diagnosed with sight and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome or fragile X syndrome.</para>
<para>The long-term care and support needs of people with disability is a national priority that demands a national response.</para>
<para>The government therefore looks forward to giving careful consideration to the Productivity Commission’s forthcoming report on a national disability insurance scheme.</para>
<para>Prevention of violence against women and children will also be a priority in this term of the parliament.</para>
<para>The forthcoming National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children will focus the efforts of all governments on preventing violence, delivering justice for victims and improving support services.</para>
<para>Problem gambling is another important social issue that the government seeks to address during this new term.</para>
<para>The social cost of problem gambling is estimated to be $4.7 billion a year, along with an incalculable human toll on gambling addicts and their families.</para>
<para>The government will therefore work to implement, by 2014, a best practice full pre-commitment scheme that is uniform across all states and territories and machines, consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission.</para>
<para>The extent and intractability of homelessness remains one of the greatest stains on Australia’s deserved reputation for social fairness and decency.</para>
<para>The government is committed to reducing the number of Australians who are homeless and will work closely with state and territory governments and the non-profit sector to halve the rate of homelessness and offer accommodation to all people who sleep rough by 2020.</para>
<para>Enhancement of the non-profit sector is also a key priority for this term, and the government will therefore create a new office for the non-profit sector, harmonise and simplify laws on non-profit issues and examine the merits of a single national regulator.</para>
<para>The government will strengthen its support for the arts with the release of Australia’s first national cultural policy in almost two decades.</para>
<para>The government will also support the performing arts sector, help build a stronger contemporary music industry and respond to the review of the screen production sector during this term of the parliament.</para>
<para class="bold">Building Regional Australia</para>
<para>Honourable senators and members, the recent election has brought renewed attention to the needs of the one-third of Australians who live outside our major cities and who exemplify in a special way our nation’s heritage and character.</para>
<para>Those citizens rightly aspire to high-quality, accessible services befitting their status as equal members of the Australian community.</para>
<para>Accordingly the government has appointed a new cabinet level minister for regional Australia, supported by a new department of regional Australia.</para>
<para>In addition, the government will establish a new House of Representatives committee on regional Australia, allowing members to inquire into the needs and resourcing of our regions and the impact of legislation on regional communities.</para>
<para>The government will also fund the creation of a regional development policy centre to provide an additional source of independent advice for honourable members and the wider community.</para>
<para>In terms of resources, 60 per cent of the government’s nation-building infrastructure funding has already been allocated to regional Australia, as has the $6 billion Regional Infrastructure Fund.</para>
<para>Building on these developments, the government will significantly increase the level of resources available to regional Australia.</para>
<para>The government will invest $800 million in a new priority regional infrastructure program that will fund projects such as transport, economic and community infrastructure as identified by local communities.</para>
<para>Regional universities and TAFEs will have access to a dedicated regional priorities round of up to $500 million from the Education Investment Fund.</para>
<para>There will also be a regional priority round from the Health and Hospitals Fund to build and upgrade regional health infrastructure and support clinical training capacity in our regional hospitals.</para>
<para>In addition, the government will ensure that regional Australia receives a minimum population based funding entitlement of all educational resources, and will develop a regional education and skills plan during the course of 2011.</para>
<para>Importantly, the government will also carry forward its commitment to build the inland rail link, which has been so long awaited by many country communities.</para>
<para>And under the government’s Building Better Regional Cities program, funding will be provided to help facilitate the construction of up to 15,000 affordable homes in regional cities that wish to expand.</para>
<para class="bold">Climate change and sustainability</para>
<para>Honourable senators and members, Australia’s natural heritage is a precious gift held in trust for future generations and for the entire world.</para>
<para>It is the government’s strong view that Australia’s unique way of life must be preserved through measures to ensure a more sustainable future, by both protecting the environment and enhancing the amenity of our urban communities.</para>
<para>During this term of office, the government will develop the nation’s first ever sustainable population strategy to examine future population needs and how population growth can be better underpinned by appropriate infrastructure and services.</para>
<para>Of vital importance to the government’s agenda is the need to reduce the level of damaging greenhouse gas emissions, which endanger the sustainability of our planet.</para>
<para>Accordingly, the government will shortly convene a new multiparty climate change committee to provide advice on mechanisms for implementing a carbon price and how best to build community consensus.</para>
<para>The committee’s work will be vital in enabling the parliament to conduct a wide-ranging and informed debate on this important issue.</para>
<para>At the same time, the government will work to harness the power of natural resources, including wind, solar, geothermal energy and biofuels, as well as funding transmission infrastructure to bring renewable energy from our regions to our cities.</para>
<para>The government will also bring forward legislation to strengthen emission standards for new power stations and motor vehicles as well as providing tax concessions for sustainable buildings and rebates for the replacement of older, inefficient vehicles.</para>
<para>In addition, the government’s proposed carbon farming initiative will facilitate the sale of carbon credits on domestic and international markets providing a new source of income for farmers and reducing carbon pollution.</para>
<para>As the world’s driest inhabited continent Australia must carefully steward its precious water resources especially those of our greatest river system, the Murray-Darling.</para>
<para>The government has already purchased more than 900 billion litres of water entitlements for environmental flows, and the release of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan guide next month will advance this important national priority.</para>
<para>To better protect our most sensitive marine habitats and assist the long-term viability of our ocean based industries, the government will seek to build a representative network of protected areas in Australian waters.</para>
<para>During this term, the government will also respond to the independent review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and will develop a national food plan to examine the long-term sustainability of Australia’s food production.</para>
<para class="bold">National security and international relations</para>
<para>Honourable members and senators, as a diverse multicultural nation dedicated to free trade and creative middle-power diplomacy Australia has a constructive role to play on the world stage.</para>
<para>The government will continue to foster those relationships that are so essential to Australia’s interests, including our alliance with the United States and our core bilateral relationships with partners in our region.</para>
<para>The government will also ensure that Australia remains an active and effective member of key multilateral institutions, including the United Nations, the G20, the East Asia Summit and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</para>
<para>There is no higher policy priority than national security, and the government will continue to build a whole-of-government approach to meet the full range of threats and challenges that may arise.</para>
<para>The government’s most immediate national security priority is Afghanistan, where the international community seeks to prevent that country from again becoming a terrorist staging ground.</para>
<para>Our nation’s engagement has come at a high price and we honour the memory of the 21 Australians who have made the supreme sacrifice in Afghanistan since 2001.</para>
<para>The government remains committed to the task in Afghanistan and will continue to provide the support necessary for Australian forces to complete their mission.</para>
<para>Acknowledging the increasing number of personnel who are injured on duty, the government will introduce a new support scheme, the Simpson program, which will provide increased assistance, training and access to specialist rehabilitation for wounded Defence Force members.</para>
<para>More broadly, the government remains committed to ensuring Australia has the defence capabilities it needs to meet current and future challenges while also ensuring that defence spending remains prudent and cost effective.</para>
<para>The loss of Australian lives in Bali in 2002 and 2005 is a potent reminder of the need for vigilance and resolve against the threat of terrorism.</para>
<para>Accordingly, the government remains committed to a comprehensive approach to counterterrorism which focuses on prevention and reducing the risks faced by Australians at home and abroad.</para>
<para>The government also recognises the grave threat to international peace posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and know-how, and will continue to pursue the cause of disarmament together with our international partners.</para>
<para>On the issue of border protection, the government seeks to remove the incentive for asylum seekers to undertake dangerous sea voyages to Australia while promoting an approach to assessing refugee claims that is efficient, timely and fair.</para>
<para>Accordingly, the government remains committed to an effective response to irregular maritime migration through the development of a regional protection framework in cooperation with our regional neighbours as well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration.</para>
<para>The government will always honour the obligations under the United Nations Refugee Convention to which our country became a party under Prime Minister Menzies in 1954.</para>
<para class="bold">Conclusion</para>
<para>Honourable senators and members, with the convening of the 43rd Parliament, our system of government ventures into terrain not encountered since the far-off days of World War II.</para>
<para>As one of the world’s oldest continuing democracies, we have it within our grasp to ensure that the challenges posed by the configuration of this parliament become a source of renewal and change.</para>
<para>Certainly the story of our nation tells us that nothing is impossible when we work together and seek the best in each other—drawing upon the qualities of resourcefulness and courage that are such a hallmark of the Australian spirit.</para>
<para>The government acknowledges that the measures outlined today are not the complete sum of what can be accomplished by this parliament.</para>
<para>Rather, it is the government’s hope that through its strong leadership, combined with goodwill and consensus, even more can be achieved to the benefit of our people and the advancement of our Commonwealth in the term that lies ahead.</para>
<para>I therefore wish you well in your deliberations and warmly commend your dedication to the service of our nation.</para>
<para>And with great faith in the enduring strength of our democratic institutions, I take pride in opening the 43rd Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia.</para>

<para>—by leave—I have the honour to inform the Senate that, following the election held on 21 August 2010, the Governor-General commissioned the Prime Minister to form a government. Ministers and parliamentary secretaries were appointed on 14 September 2010. For the information of honourable senators I have a list of the full ministry. The document lists all ministers and parliamentary secretaries and the offices they hold. It shows those ministers who comprise the cabinet and provides details of representation arrangements in each chamber. I would also like to inform the Senate that Senator McEwen has been elected as the Government Whip in the Senate and that Senator Carol Brown and Senator Polley have been elected as Deputy Government Whips in the Senate. I look forward to working with them in their new roles.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would like to congratulate all our frontbenchers on their election to the roles of ministers and parliamentary secretaries. I am pleased to say we have a larger frontbench than last time, although we are down one minister—but that position has been ably replaced by five parliamentary secretaries. I would particularly like to congratulate Senators Lundy, Collins, Feeney and Farrell on their new appointments and to welcome Senator McLucas on her return to the frontbench. I would also like to place on record my thanks to the other members of the government team who served on the frontbench in the first term of the government for the contribution they made. I particularly note the contributions of Senator Faulkner and Senator Stephens, who no doubt will continue to serve with distinction in the Senate.</para>
<para>In conclusion, on behalf of Labor senators I note the passing of Neil Bessell, who I understand passed away on 5 July this year. Neil was a long-serving and dedicated Senate officer who was known to all senators. On behalf of the government and, I am sure, all members of the Senate, I would like to acknowledge Neil’s contribution to the Senate and extend our condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.</para>
<para>I would also like to congratulate those members of the coalition who have been appointed to their frontbench, particularly those who have recently moved into shadow ministerial roles. We look forward to crossing swords with them in the years to come.</para>

<para>—by leave—I will commence my remarks by associating the coalition with the Leader of the Government’s comments in relation to Neil Bessell. Senator Stephen Parry and I represented the coalition at his funeral service. He was a dedicated servant of this parliament and this Senate. I personally had the great pleasure of working with him when I was Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and he was its secretary. Whilst I think we got a hint at his funeral of his political beliefs, I confess I was never aware of them whilst working with him. He was a great standard-bearer for the Senate and the professionalism of the secretarial services that we have in this chamber.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I congratulate Senator Evans and members of the Labor Party on being recommissioned by Her Excellency the Governor-General to form a government. I can assure the Leader of the Government in the Senate that he will not need to wait for the years to come to cross swords; we will keep the government accountable. I congratulate Senator Evans on his reappointment and those ministers who have been promoted—the backbenchers who have received commissions and been sworn in. It is a great privilege to be able to serve in that role. On a personal basis I wish them well but of course look forward to the day when they sit on this side. I also acknowledge the services of Senator Faulkner and Senator Stephens to this parliament and in the ministerial roles they played.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to the coalition, Senator George Brandis and I were honoured by being re-elected as deputy leader and leader respectively of the coalition in this place at a recent party meeting. I congratulate Senator Fifield on his appointment as Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate and also on having the disability portfolio elevated to a shadow ministerial role. I believe that was very significant. I also congratulate Senator Mason on his elevation to the shadow ministry and Senators Nash, Ryan and Cash on their elevation as shadow parliamentary secretaries.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that, in the absence of a clear strategic case for high-risk first-of-type acquisitions, military off-the-shelf purchases should be the default option for procurement projects.</para>
<para class="block">This recommendation does not necessarily relate to any particular acquisitions currently under consideration but rather represents a broader statement of policy reflecting on issues relating to past acquisition programs.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in principle.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Defence White Paper 2009 states at para 16.17 that the “Government has decided that military-off-the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf solutions to Defence’s capability requirements will be the benchmark against which a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the military effects and schedule aspects of all proposals will be undertaken. Such an approach is consistent with the Defence Procurement and Sustainment Review.”</para>
<para class="block">The Government’s response to the Defence Procurement and Sustainment Review (the Mortimer Review) stated that off-the-shelf (OTS) options will be considered as an option for all procurements. Defence will provide Government with clear information on the costs and benefits of OTS options for all procurements.</para>
<para class="block">The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet updated its Cabinet Handbook in July 2009. The associated Drafter’s Guide – Preparation of Cabinet Submissions and Memoranda states, “The options must include at least one off-the-shelf option, where such an option exists, and where it is judged not to exist, this must be explained in the first-pass approval submission.”</para>
<para class="block">Defence is fully implementing these requirements.</para>
<para class="block">In summary, where an off-the-shelf option does exist, it will be presented for Government consideration and will be the benchmark against which a rigorous cost benefit analysis of the military effects and schedule aspects of all proposals will be undertaken; and when an off-the-shelf option is judged not to exist, this will be explained in the first-pass submission to Government.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence review its current procedures for rapid acquisition to ensure that it is meeting the ADF’s needs, particularly where they are linked directly to overseas operational commitments.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Defence has a robust and flexible rapid acquisition policy in support of operations. This policy and its processes were re-issued in February 2008, and are subject to regular review to ensure they meet the Australian Defence Force’s requirements. The policy and procedures are currently being reviewed by the Defence Logistics Working Group. All acquisitions follow a rigorous and responsive process where the customer is engaged at all stages. The Defence Materiel Organisation also reports its progress every six months to the Chief of the Defence Force, the Service Chiefs and other key staff.</para>
<para class="block">The purchase of capital equipment by rapid acquisition, which by-passes the usual two pass approval process, is used where an unforeseen operational capability is urgently required by the ADF for current operations. The Government may provide additional funding to Defence, in cases of exceptional circumstances, where such a capability is required as a result of major operational or strategic discontinuities or in cases of exceptional and unanticipated operational contingencies. Defence will bring forward any such requests on a case-by-case basis for Government consideration in accordance with the standard approval thresholds for major capital equipment. For instance, National Security Committee or Prime Ministerial agreement is required for acquisitions over $100 million. The Government decides on a case-by-case basis whether supplementation will be provided or Defence will absorb the cost of rapid acquisition proposals. Generally speaking the Defence Capability Plan is the source of funding for meeting Defence’s major capital equipment needs, both current and future, particularly where there is an ongoing utility past the immediate requirement associated with the equipment being procured.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that Defence places a high priority on developing a solution to the difficulties that it, and KPMG, has identified with the current pay systems.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Defence does not have a modern, integrated human resource and pay system for its total workforce. The current separate systems – PMKeyS, ADFPAY and CENRESPAYII – feature old technology and vendor support is expensive and problematic.</para>
<para class="block">These systems represent a significant business continuity risk to Defence. Additionally, the technology and platforms are not capable of enabling the business reform expected of Defence under the Strategic Reform Program (SRP), and particularly that required to move to a shared services business environment in human resource administration.</para>
<para class="block">Defence will address these problems by bringing forward investment in sustainment and modernisation of these systems, and integrating those projects with business redesign and reform. This will be achieved, initially, through a Technical Refresh of the core management information system PMKeyS and, in the longer term, through a system upgrade under Defence Capability Plan Project JP2080 phase 2B.1. In the interim, some changes have been made to existing business processes and systems.</para>
<para class="block">Further, simplification of the remuneration structure and the remediation and modernisation of Defence personnel and pay systems will take place as part of the broader workforce and shared services reforms and will be conducted in accordance with an Integrated Master Plan.</para>
<para class="block">The cost of the Personnel Systems Technical Refresh, which is estimated at $61m and will take 23 months to complete, will be funded from the Chief Information Officer Group’s operating budget. JP2080 phase 2B.1 is listed in the Defence Capability Plan 2009 as having an acquisition cost of $100m-$500m (towards the upper end of the band) and will be decided during 2012-13.</para>
<para class="block">The Defence senior leadership is committed to the remediation and modernisation of Defence’s personnel systems to enable a shared services business future and achieve identified SRP savings outcomes.</para>
<para class="block">On 2 February 2010 the then-Minster for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science announced the establishment of a high powered ADF Payroll Task Force to be co-chaired by Lieutenant General David Hurley, Vice Chief of the Defence Force, and Mr Martin Bowles, Deputy Secretary Defence Support.</para>
<para class="block">The Task Force will focus on the reform of the ADF Pay and Personnel processes and will:</para>

</list>
<para class="block">The Task Force will also focus on ensuring long term reform of the ADF pay and personnel processes. In keeping with the Strategic Reform Program this will include the consolidation of all military payroll processing under one area of responsibility within 18 months. This will result in complex transactions and manual processing being undertaken by one central authority, not fragmented as is currently the case.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that Defence ensure the provision of submarine escape training at HMAS Stirling be re-established.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in principle.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The provision of Submarine Escape training at HMAS Stirling has never ceased. Rather one element of the submarine escape training course, namely the two day pressurised escape training component is currently being undertaken in Canada.</para>
<para class="block">Activities are well progressed for pressurised escape training to be re-established at HMAS Stirling. The escape tank and life support systems remain under remediation and are expected to undergo final set to work and certification in April 2010. The significant repair and refurbishment program was necessitated by contaminants in the breathing air system, complicated by significant obsolescence issues prior to rebuilding to ensure the hyperbaric systems comply with contemporary standards. A contract has been put in place with “The Underwater Centre Fremantle” to provide in-water instructors, whose competency training will complete once the tank and life support systems are approved for use.</para>
<para class="block">Current planning has the in-water instructor competency training completed and submarine crew pressurised escape training commencing in July 2010.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that the deployability issues governing the Australian Submarine Rescue Vehicle (ASRV) Remora be resolved without delay.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in principle.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The ASRV Remora is in storage in Western Australia having been repaired, upgraded and recertified by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), subject to final sea trials that will occur once the Launch and Recovery System (LARS) is recertified. Both the ASRV Remora and LARS are receiving all appropriate layup maintenance while in storage.</para>
<para class="block">In December 2008 the Classification Society DNV advised the DMO that there were re- certification issues with the submarine rescue vehicle’s LARS. The LARS Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Caley subsequently proposed a modification to satisfy DNV contemporary certification requirements. The DMO engaged DNV to review the Caley modification for its acceptability. The design concept was endorsed by DNV with Caley engaging to develop a detailed design. Delivery of the detailed design solution by Caley was due in December 2009, but delayed by coincident litigation by the Commonwealth of Australia against Caley for loss of Remora in December 2006. Once received, DNV will be contracted to review the design for its acceptability and identify any limitations that they might impose on its operation. This detailed design review by DNV is not expected to be complete until April 2010, assuming the design is received in January 2010.</para>
<para class="block">There remains some risk that the design modifications could ultimately fail to achieve final DNV certification, which would present further difficulties in the recommissioning of the existing LARS system.</para>
<para class="block">A decision on the future of the existing ASRV Remora and LARS will not be possible until July 2010 following evaluation of the DNV design review. The decision will require careful consideration of the system’s utility, particularly if significant operational limitations are identified by DNV. A final decision would also need to include consideration of the cost and capability that might be achievable if the current LARS was replaced with a new system.</para>
<para class="block">It should be noted that an interim submarine rescue capability has been contracted with James Fisher Defence United Kingdom. Their LR5 submarine rescue system has been prepositioned at Henderson Western Australia, and is maintained at 12 hours notice for emergency deployment in the event of a disabled submarine. A demonstration of the capability and subsequent Black Carillon exercise is planned for the first quarter of 2010.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that Defence adopt a more assertive strategy with regard to oil shocks and alternative fuels, with the specific purpose of providing a capability to mitigate risk due to a dependence on oil-based fuels. Defence should provide such a capability, sufficient to maintain an identified core capability, within a timeframe of 10 years.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in principle.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Defence supports the recommendation that it adopt a more assertive strategy to minimise the impact an oil shock may have on Defence and it’s ability to fulfil its role. Defence, however, does not agree that it should be developing capability that is not dependant on oil-based fuels within 10 years. To agree to such a commitment would impose significant challenges for Defence.</para>
<para class="block">Defence has established a number of bodies as a response to the raising cost of oil, as well as to examine potential alternative fuels options for use by Defence. The Directorate of Strategic Fuel, within Joint Logistics Command, was established in December 2008 to resolve some of these challenges and has focused initially on identifying fuel issues and opportunities across Defence with the primary aim of developing an integrated Fuel Strategy and Defence Fuel Manual.</para>
<para class="block">The Defence Fuel Management Committee has been set up within the Directorate of Strategic Fuel to coordinate and over-sight strategic fuel management and policy across Defence, including sponsorship of research into alternative fuels and energy through collaboration with Defence Science and Technology Organisation, fuel companies, Defence industry and allied forces. Defence, through the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, engages with the US and other countries in the research of alternative fuels for military application.</para>
<para class="block">Defence strategic planning takes account of possible disruptions to fuel supplies. The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism is the lead agency responsible for developing a national, whole-of-Government approach to resolving Australia’s future energy security challenges. Defence is a member of the National Oil Supplies Emergency Committee, which provides the main channel through which the Commonwealth and the State and Territory Governments formulate an overall management response to any national liquid fuels emergency.</para>
<para class="block">Alternative fuels are only expected to be used as a supplement to the use of oil based fuels over the next 20 years. It is expected that there will be a growth in the use of flexible fuel vehicles, hybrid electric drive designs and semi-synthetic fuel blends. However, currently there are limited fuel alternatives to petroleum product for military transport. It is expected that the likely higher cost of oil based fuels to 2030 will generate investment and production of synthetic fuels and biofuel, and further stimulate research and development in alternative and renewable energy sources.</para>
<para class="block">Defence will continue to work together in a national approach with other agencies and allied forces to investigate the use of viable alternative fuels for use in its platforms and will continue to develop robust policy and strategy for the management of its fuels and to reduce the impact of oil shocks.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Committee recommends that new fuels developed to mitigate risk to Australia’s defence capability from oil shocks and oil scarcity be designed to reduce Defence’s carbon footprint, where possible, in balance with energy yields and other practical considerations.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Agreed in principle.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">Defence supports the recommendation that it develop strategies to reduce its energy carbon footprint but does not agree to develop new alternative fuels. Defence does not have the ability to drive commercial research or the type of commercial fuels available and therefore needs to work with whole-of-Government and allied partners in investigating possible alternative fuels for use by Defence.</para>
<para class="block">Fuel is a critical component of Defence capability as it provides the ADF with the means to operate its military platforms. However, it should be noted that Defence represents less than two per cent of the total National liquid fuels market and therefore as a relatively small customer.</para>
<para class="block">Defence is considering its transport fuel mix in response to global developments and working in a national approach with agencies such as the federal Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, on the use of viable alternative energy sources and in the reduction of Defence’s carbon footprint.</para>
<para class="block">Petroleum is expected to be available for military use past 2030, and during this time is expected to remain the dominant military fuel source. Trends in conventional military fuels are cleaner fuels, and more efficient use of fuel through hybrid energy systems. Alternative fuels, energy sources, and propulsion systems are considered part of the mobility and energy solution for ADF platforms and operations.</para>
<para class="block">Defence also sponsors a number of reports and studies on peak fuel and the feasibility of using alternative fuels in the ADF and has undertaken some initial preparatory research into the effects of possible alternative fuels on some ADF platforms.</para>
<para class="block">It should also be noted that International military organisations, such as the United States Air Force and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence are playing a significant role in promoting the uptake and commercialisation of alternative fuels and power generation (for example, gas/coal/biomass to liquids for aviation fuels). However, in general, these processes are being developed in the commercial arena. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation is a partner with the US, UK and Canada in a Study</para>
<para class="block">Group examining future military power and energy requirements and supplies, to identify collaborative opportunities in the energy domain. The exchange of this information will allow Defence to position itself to exploit the benefits of alternative fuels as they are certified for use and become commercially available.</para>
<para class="block">Defence is well placed to meet the challenges of the future and is focused on policy reform, internal realignment and strategic engagement to provide a more comprehensive whole-of-Defence approach to fuel management and carbon reduction.</para>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Introduction</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government welcomes the Committee’s report Access to justice released on 8 December 2009.</para>
<para class="block">Access to justice is central to the rule of law and integral to the enjoyment of basic human rights. It is an essential precondition to social inclusion and a critical element of a well functioning democracy.</para>
<para class="block">Submissions to the Committee highlight several areas where reforms to the legal system would be beneficial in making justice more accessible to Australians, particularly those suffering disadvantage.</para>
<para class="block">An accessible and effective federal justice system is a key priority of the Australian Government’s agenda for reform. Improving access to justice is not only about access to courts and access to lawyers, but also about having the means to improve ‘everyday justice’: the justice quality of people’s social, civic and economic relations. Improving access to justice involves providing timely access to good information about the law, improving the quality of primary-decision making, ensuring that laws are clear, and improving the knowledge of and engagement with less adversarial dispute resolution options.</para>
<para class="block">The commitment to this priority is demonstrated in a range of initiatives already undertaken by Government to improve the accessibility and effectiveness of our federal justice system:</para>
<para class="block">(a) adopted a Strategic Framework for Access to Justice which is based on five key principles of accessibility, appropriateness, equity, efficiency and effectiveness. These principles will guide future policy development,</para>
<para class="block">(b0 endorsed the five principles by all State and Territory Attorneys-General at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General meeting, November 2009, which promotes a consistent and coordinated approach to access to justice,</para>
<para class="block">(c) injected $154 million over four years for legal assistance services in 2010-11 Federal Budget, taking the total Commonwealth contribution to over $1.2 billion. An important component of access to justice is supporting those who cannot afford legal services. This is the most significant injection of new Commonwealth funding for legal assistance programs in well over a decade. The new funding will focus on early intervention services and will reinforce a shift away from expensive adversarial court litigation,</para>
<para class="block">(d) negotiated a new National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services with the States and Territories. The new Agreement promotes reform to legal assistance service delivery by promoting early intervention services, which avoids the need for litigation, and more appropriate targeting of legal assistance services to people who experience, or are at risk of experiencing, social exclusion. The new Agreement provides greater flexibility for legal aid commissions to provide preventative and early intervention services regardless of whether the matter type comes within Commonwealth or State and Territory law. Commissions will have the flexibility to use Commonwealth funds for grants of aid for State law matters where a child’s welfare or an applicant’s safety is at risk and there is an overlapping family law matter.</para>
<para class="block">(e) established a new National Legal Assistance Advisory Body to help develop national responses to critical challenges affecting the legal assistance sector. The Advisory Body will provide strategic policy advice to the Attorney-General on issues affecting the provision of legal assistance services, including the coordination and integration of services, improved access and availability, and early intervention.</para>
<para class="block">(f) launched an Access to Justice website to provide seamless access to local information about legal assistance and related services at &lt;www.accesstojustice.gov.au&gt;,</para>
<para class="block">(g) passed important legislative reforms to the case management powers of the Federal Court aimed at reducing unnecessary delay and time spent in court,</para>
<para class="block">(h) introduced the Civil Dispute Resolution Bill requiring people to take genuine steps to resolve their disputes before going to court, and encouraging parties and their lawyers to consider a range of options which can assist with resolving the matter or narrowing the issues involved . This Bill implements recommendations of the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council (NADRAC) in the Council’s report The resolve to resolve.- embracing ADR to improve access to justice in the federal jurisdiction, November 2009,</para>
<para class="block">(i) issued three new terms of reference to NADRAC for specific work. These terms of reference include the preparation of a statement of national ADR principles, the development of a model dispute management plan for Government agencies, and providing advice on the integrity of ADR processes,</para>
<para class="block">(j) requested a review by the Australian Law Reform Commission of discovery and to identify options to improve the discovery process in civil litigation which will promote early information exchange,</para>
<para class="block">(k) committed to develop improved administrative law guidelines for Commonwealth officials, and</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the federal, state and territory governments jointly fund a comprehensive national survey of demand and unmet need for legal assistance services in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, with particular identification of rural, regional and remote communities and indigenous women’s needs, to be jointly undertaken with state/territory legal aid commissions, community legal centres, Aboriginal legal services, National Legal Aid and the Law and Justice Foundation NSW.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is noted.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government is committed to the delivery of high quality and culturally sensitive legal assistance services to Indigenous Australians. The Government is also aware of the increasing demand for legal assistance services and the significant funding pressures faced by all legal aid service providers, including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS).</para>
<para class="block">The Government announced additional ongoing funding of $34.9 million over four years from 2010-11 for Indigenous legal services. This additional funding will assist in meeting increasing demand and costs for Indigenous legal services and will improve access to justice for Indigenous Australians across Australia, supporting key Government priorities, including social inclusion and closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. In 2010-11 the Government has allocated over $63.7 million for Indigenous legal aid services through the ATSILS, and for law reform and community legal education activities.</para>
<para class="block">Ministers discussed Indigenous legal services funding at the May 2010 meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The Commonwealth in consultation with the States and Territories will undertake a review of the relationship between the delivery of legal services for Indigenous Australians by legal aid commissions and Indigenous legal service providers.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government provided funding to the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service to supervise a national review of the workload of the Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander Legal Services. A consultant has been engaged to conduct the review and is expected to report by the end of 2010. The findings are expected to include data on the demand for Indigenous legal services experienced by the Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander Legal Services.</para>
<para class="block">A comprehensive National Legal Needs Survey is being conducted by the Law and Justice Foundation of NSW on behalf of National Legal Aid and will report in 2011. The Survey will include data on the legal needs of Indigenous people.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the federal, state and territory governments, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, and using an evidence-based approach, review existing legal assistance service programs to determine whether the legal aid system is meeting the needs of the Australian people.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is agreed in principle.</para>
<para class="block">In November 2009 the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General agreed that to inform negotiations for the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services, National Justice CEOs will consider:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>opportunities for greater coordination and collaboration of service delivery across the legal assistance sector,</para>

The third issue referred by ministers, alternative sources of revenue, has been dealt with separately through the National Justice CEOs’ discussions on the National Partnership Agreement.</para>
<para class="block">As detailed above, in May 2010 the Attorney-General announced the establishment of the new National Legal Assistance Advisory Body. The Advisory Body will provide advice on strategic policy issues affecting the provision of legal assistance services, including the coordination and integration of services, improved access and availability, and early intervention. The Advisory Body will inform and be informed by work undertaken by State and Territory based forums outlined in the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the federal, state and territory governments, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, and using an evidence-based approach, review existing funding programs for legal aid commissions, community legal centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services and Family Violence Prevention Legal Services units with a view to sufficiently resourcing the legal aid system to meet the legal needs of the Australian people, including appropriate loadings for high needs areas such as remote, rural and regional areas.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is noted.</para>
<para class="block">The Government is committed to ensuring that legal assistance programs are appropriately resourced so that disadvantaged Australians who cannot afford legal services are able to receive assistance. This includes fostering efficient and effective ways to support the delivery of legal services in remote, rural and regional Australia.</para>
<para class="block">From 1 July 2010, the Australian Government will invest an additional $154 million over four years in legal assistance services: $92.3 million for legal aid; $34.9 million for Indigenous legal services; and $26.8 million for community legal services. The new funding will build on over $70 million in additional funding provided by the Australian Government for legal assistance services over the last three financial years</para>
<para class="block">In 2010-11 the Australian Government will provide the following Budget funding:</para>

<para class="block">Current funding models for legal aid and indigenous legal assistance programs take into account a range of factors including consideration of the specific issues which affect the delivery of legal assistance services in remote, rural and regional Australia such as population dispersion, through the increased costs of communication and travel in servicing clients, and the number and location of courts serviced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS). Community legal centres which provide services to remote, rural and regional areas have received support to provide outreach services in these areas and assistance with costs of delivery such as travel, accommodation and equipment.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the state/ territory governments and legal professional associations throughout Australia take such steps as are necessary to:</inline>
</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>advertise and promote participation in formal pro bono schemes, including the National Pro Bono Aspirational Target Scheme;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>mandate a pro bono legal work requirement for all classes of practising certificate, including those issued to government employees; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>abolish the practising certificate fee for legal practitioners whose practise involves pro bono legal work only.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block">The recommendation is accepted in principle.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government commends the legal profession for the high quality pro bono work it performs. The Government is committed to working with the legal profession and other stakeholders to encourage and support pro bono legal work, both in Australia and internationally. The Australian Government has undertaken a number of steps in recent years to recognise and support pro bono legal services in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government supports and provides ongoing funding to the National Pro Bono Resource Centre. The Centre will receive funding of $275,480 in 2010-11. The Government also provided one-off funding of $40,000 to assist with the completion of the research project Engaging Retired and Career-Break Lawyers in Pro Bono. The Government also provides</para>
<para class="block">funding to support the Biennial Access to Justice and Pro Bono Conference which provides an opportunity for community and private sector lawyers, academics and judicial officers to come together and discuss current issues in the area of pro bono and legal assistance.</para>
<para class="block">In 2008, the Government amended the Legal Services Directions 2005 to require that Commonwealth agencies must take the following matters into account when offering a contract for legal services:</para>
<para class="block">(a) the amount and type of pro bono work the legal services provider has carried out or will carry out, and</para>
<para class="block">(b) whether the legal services provider has signed up to the National Pro Bono Aspirational Target of the National Pro Bono Resource Centre.</para>
<para class="block">The COAG National Legal Profession Reform project has given particular consideration to how legal profession regulation can help facilitate volunteerism and reduce the burden on community legal centres and other community legal service providers. In so doing, the National Legal Profession Reform Taskforce has taken into account submissions from the National Pro Bono Resource Centre and National Association of Community Legal Centres.</para>
<para class="block">The Taskforce is proposing the introduction of a no or nominal cost volunteer practising certificate for legal practitioners who wish to volunteer at non-profit or community legal centres anywhere around Australia, and who do not otherwise hold a practising certificate.</para>
<para class="block">This would, for example, allow retired lawyers and government lawyers to volunteer their legal expertise. The proposal also includes ensuring that there are no practising certificate related impediments to undertaking pro bono and volunteer work for those who hold a general practising certificate.</para>
<para class="block">The Taskforce is also proposing to simplify the regulatory system to which non-profit or community legal services are subject by creating a single system of regulation, rather than different systems in each jurisdiction, and by clarifying the responsibilities of the principal or `supervising’ legal practitioners of community centres providing legal services. The centres would have the flexibility to designate a volunteer supervising legal practitioner rather than formally employing one.</para>
<para class="block">The proposal also includes allowing legal practitioners working or volunteering at those centres to choose not to handle trust money. The benefits are that those legal practitioners and the legal centre would not be subject to the regulation that comes with handling trust money and, as there would be no risk of them defaulting with trust money, the practitioners would not need to pay fidelity contributions.</para>
<para class="block">The model proposed by the Taskforce also makes it clear that legal practitioners volunteering at a non-profit or community legal centre may be covered by the professional indemnity insurance of the centre, and would not be required to obtain additional, individual professional indemnity insurance.</para>
<para class="block">The Taskforce is currently consulting on its proposals and will be submitting its final proposals to COAG by the end of 2010.</para>
<para class="block">The Attorney-General’s International Pro Bono Advisory Group was established in July 2009 to promote international pro bono work by Australia’s legal profession; build effective partnerships in overseas legal capacity building and access to justice work; and facilitate effective coordination between the private sector, the non-government sector, existing in-country structures and Australian Government funding projects that address international law and justice needs. The Government has established a website to provide a portal on international pro bono legal work with a range of general resources such as factsheets and evaluation templates, and links to the websites of brokers and clearing houses. These resources will be of assistance to all firms interested in undertaking international pro bono work.</para>
<para class="block">The Attorney-General will host an International Pro Bono Roundtable to coincide with the third National Access to Justice and Pro Bono Conference in Brisbane in August 2010. The Roundtable will include a panel of speakers with a range of different experiences in international pro bono work and development assistance in the law and justice sector.</para>

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the Australian Government investigate means by which small: to medium sized legal firms could be encouraged to further participate in the provision of pro bono legal services.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is noted.</para>
<para class="block">The proposals of the National Legal Profession Reform Taskforce outlined in the response to Recommendation 4 are also expected to lower the burden on law practices offering the time of their legal practitioners to non-profit or community legal centres.</para>
<para class="block">The National Pro Bono Resource Centre, which receives funding from the Australian Government, plays a key role in promoting pro bono work, including to small and medium sized legal firms. The Attorney-General’s International Pro Bono Advisory Group, which was established in July 2009, will also help to promote and support international pro bono work by Australian lawyers. The Attorney-General’s Department has updated the Advisory Group’s website to provide a portal on international pro bono legal work with a range of general resources such as factsheets and evaluation templates, and links to the websites of brokers and clearing houses. These resources will be of assistance to all firms interested in undertaking international pro bono work.</para>

<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the federal, state and territory governments provide additional funding to legal aid commissions, community legal centres and Indigenous legal services with a view to expanding service delivery in rural, regional and remote areas. This funding must take into account the significant resources required by legal aid commissions, community legal centres and Indigenous legal services in undertaking resource-building initiatives in rural, regional and remote areas.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is agreed in principle.</para>
<para class="block">The Australian Government acknowledges the significant resources required by legal aid commissions, community legal centres and Indigenous legal services in undertaking resource-building initiatives in rural, regional and remote areas. That is why the Government injected an additional $154 million over four years into legal assistance services, to make the Commonwealth’s overall injection of funding to $1.2 billion over four years.</para>
<para class="block">New funding announced in the 2010-11 Budget will enhance the capacity of legal assistance services to deliver services in rural, regional and remote locations. The sharper focus on preventative and early intervention services that will be reflected in the National Partnership Agreement is expected to lead to more outreach services to areas which now lack services. The Government has also funded some specific initiatives to improve services in rural, regional and remote areas.</para>
<para class="block">In June 2008, the Government announced the allocation of $5.8 million over four years for the Regional Innovations Program for Legal Services. This initiative aims to improve access to legal services for communities in regional, rural and remote Australia. Legal aid commissions are eligible to obtain funding for programs which take an innovative approach to improve service delivery in rural and remote areas.</para>
<para class="block">In addition to the increase in funding announced in the 2010 Budget, the Australian Government has provided Legal Aid Western Australia with one-off funding of $500,000 to continue its Country Lawyers Program which aims to encourage lawyers to practice in regional and remote areas of Western Australia. This funding is in addition to the</para>
<para class="block">$1.1 million already invested in the program since 2007.

<para class="block">The recommendation is noted.</para>
<para class="block">Ensuring that legal practitioner services are available to people living in rural, regional and remote (RRR) areas is a high priority. The Australian Government has provided $6.9 million over the four year period 2007-08 to 2010-11 through the Regional Innovations Program for Legal Services to improve legal services in regional Australia. The Government notes the Law Council of Australia’s September 2009 report regarding the recruitment and retention of lawyers in RRR areas.

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the federal, state and territory governments, in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders, jointly develop and implement a national civil law program in identified high need areas.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is noted.</para>
<para class="block">The Government considers that reforms under the National Partnership Agreement aimed at promoting the earliest resolution of legal problems and supporting connected services in the legal assistance sector will assist in improving access to services to resolve civil law matters.</para>
<para class="block">The broadening of Commonwealth legal aid funding policy to allow Commonwealth funds to be used for preventative and early intervention services will provide legal aid commissions with the capacity to expand service delivery in areas of civil law, particularly to address problems that can lead to social exclusion, such as tenancy, consumer debt and employment.</para>
<para class="block">In 2009-10, the Government provided more than $26 million directly to community legal centres under the Commonwealth Community Legal Services Program. More than 60% of activities undertaken by community legal centres (information, advice and casework) involve civil law. Of these activities, tenancy, credit and debt, and employment are the most common problem types. Additional funding in these areas has been allocated in the 2010-11 Budget including resources to enhance access to services providing assistance in the areas of consumer credit, matters affecting older people and those at risk of or experiencing homelessness, and enhanced services in regional, rural and remote areas.</para>

</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the Australian Government increase the level of funding for the Legal Aid Program with a view to sufficiently resourcing the legal aid system to meet the legal needs of the Australian people, including specific funding for community education programs and telephone advice services.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is agreed.</para>
<para class="block">From 1 July 2010, the Australian Government will provide an additional $92.3 million over four years for legal aid. The funding supports a more strategic approach to legal assistance service delivery, consistent with the Government’s Strategic Framework for Access to Justice. The focus is on early intervention and resolving disputes before they get to court. By helping people early in their disputes, costly litigation and entrenched legal problems can be avoided.</para>
<para class="block">Community legal education and early access to advice and assistance, including telephone advice, are important services already being provided by all legal assistance providers. Under the new Agreement these services will be given greater emphasis, with the requirement that States and Territories implement an Information and Referral Strategy that ensures comprehensive access to information and seamless referral for preventative and early intervention services.</para>

<para>A person may hold some assets and still be eligible for a grant of legal aid.

<item>
<para>a person who does not initially satisfy the assets component of the financial eligibility test may still be eligible for legal aid in limited circumstances, if they cannot reasonably be expected to borrow against their assets.

<para class="block">

</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is noted.</para>
<para class="block">The Government is giving consideration to this recommendation in conjunction with the federal courts and other relevant stakeholders.

<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 15</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that federal, state and territory governments, in conjunction with affected stakeholders, review and modernise existing legal aid fee scales including an inflator to promote participation off the private legal profession in legal aid service delivery.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is noted.</para>
<para class="block">Under the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services, States and Territories will have responsibility for determining how funds are used to achieve the outcomes identified in the National Partnership Agreement. This includes responsibility for input controls such as private practitioner fees. This is consistent with existing arrangements in which legal aid commissions are responsible for managing their own fee scales for work undertaken by private practitioners. Fee scales are determined by commissions in consultation with State and Territory legal professional bodies and are subject to each commission’s operating budget.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 16</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the federal, state and territory governments commission research to quantify the economic effects that self-represented litigants have on the Australian justice system, including court, tribunal, other litigant, legal aid system and social welfare system costs.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is agreed in principle.</para>
<para class="block">Courts, tribunals and legal service providers have a variety of administration arrangements and many are responsible for their own data collection. However, the Australian Government recognises that consistent data collection is necessary for justice institutions to be able to identify and act on challenges and gaps, and to inform analysis and understanding of the performance of the justice system generally.</para>
<para class="block">The Government acknowledges that statistical information in relation to the justice system is currently inconsistently collected and reported, with significant gaps existing, including in relation to self-represented litigants. The Government is currently considering options to improve the quality of data collection as part of its consideration of recommendations proposed by the Attorney-General’s Department’s Access to Justice Taskforce.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 17</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the federal courts and tribunals should report publicly on the numbers of self-represented litigants and their matter types, and urges state and territory courts to do likewise.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is noted.</para>
<para class="block">While this recommendation is directed at the courts and tribunals, the Government supports initiatives which aim to improve the accuracy and quality of data collection across the civil justice system.</para>
<para class="block">The federal courts currently publish some data on self-represented litigants in their annual reports. The Federal Court of Australia publishes broad statistics about the number of self-represented litigants appearing in the Court as applicants in a matter (respondents are not recorded), and the type of matter the majority of these applicants appear in. The Federal Magistrates Court (family law only) and the Family Court of Australia also provide statistics on the number of self-represented litigants, in respect of finalised applications for final orders.</para>
<para class="block">A number of tribunals also report publicly on the number of self-represented applicants. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal provides a break down in its annual report on the number of represented and unrepresented applicants per jurisdiction (Centrelink or Child Support Agency), in addition to the type of representation (legal or non-legal). The Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal publish data on the percentage of decided cases</para>
<para class="block">where the applicant was unrepresented, in addition to set aside rates for unrepresented applicants.</para>

<para class="block">This service provides a low-cost effective way of targeting legal assistance where people are not eligible for legal aid, improves court efficiency and is widely supported by the courts, and is effective for self-represented litigants. It is seen as an essential element of effective management of family law litigation particularly in large registries. The availability of duty lawyer services in key circuit sittings also enhances legal services for people in rural, regional and remote Australia.

<para class="block">From 1 July 2010, the Australian Government will provide an additional $26.8 million over four years for community legal services programs. This will bring the total investment in the community legal services program to $135.2 million over four years. This will help providers to enhance and increase their services including strengthening the capacity of community legal services to continue to provide legal assistance to disadvantaged people particularly in areas such as family law, domestic violence and homelessness.</para>
<para class="block">The Commonwealth Community Legal Services Program includes a range of accountability requirements that funded organisations must meet to be eligible for funding.

These projects will help students develop their legal skills and awareness of social justice and equity issues in the legal system through access to practical legal education and experience. They will also include the opportunity for students to participate in alternative dispute resolution and to provide assistance to clients in rural and regional areas.

<inline font-weight="bold">The committee recommends that the federal, state and territory governments inquire into and report on joint funding for the Legal Aid for Indigenous Australians program and related services with a view to more equitably apportioning financial responsibility for Indigenous legal services funding.</inline>
</para>
<para class="block">The recommendation is agreed in principle.</para>
<para class="block">In the 2010 Budget, the Australian Government allocated an additional $34.9 million over four years to Indigenous legal services. The Australian Government believes it is appropriate for State and Territory governments to provide funding for Indigenous legal aid services. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS) are crucial to the effective operation of the State and Territory justice systems. In 2008-09, 89% of the services’ casework was in criminal matters which are mostly State and Territory laws. Additionally, demand factors are driven by changes to State and Territory laws and policies, such as increased court circuits and numbers of magistrates, which can impact on the ability to deliver services in conditions of limited funding and rising service delivery costs. The Australian Government will raise these issues with the States and Territories as part of its coordinated approach to the delivery of legal assistance services.</para>
<para class="block">As noted in the response to recommendation 1, Ministers discussed Indigenous legal assistance services funding at the May 2010 meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.

<para class="block">During April this year an Australian parliamentary delegation undertook a biennial visit to certain parliamentary, commercial and international institutions in Europe which are of significance to Australia. This delegation was led by the President of the Senate, Senator the Hon. John Hogg. The Hon. Philip Ruddock MP was the deputy leader of the delegation, and Mr Andrew Laming MP and I were accompanying members. Although the delegation was originally scheduled to depart Australia on 16 April and spend two weeks visiting parliaments and institutions in Sweden, Denmark, France, Belgium and Germany, the eruption of an Icelandic volcano, whose name I will not even attempt to say, and its subsequent emission of an ash cloud caused major disruption to European aviation and resulted in the cancellation of the Scandinavian component of the program. However, all was not lost. Following a few days of anxiety and much hard work by the organisers, the delegation was able to proceed on an amended program arriving in Paris on 24 April, where it was straight down to work.</para>
<para>On arrival we toured the Musee du quai Branly, which houses a wonderful collection of indigenous artwork from Africa, Asia, Oceania—including Australia—and America. Some members then visited the very ornate French Senate, and we all attended various First World War battle sites on the Western Front in preparation for commemoration services on Anzac Day. We visited Fromelles, where we inspected the Pheasant Wood site and received briefings concerning the recovery of the bodies of those Australian soldiers that have been reburied at the recently opened new cemetery.</para>
<para>The delegation moved on to Peronne and inspected the Historial de la Grande Guerre, or ‘Great War Museum’, which is built behind a medieval castle. We went to Villers-Bretonneux to inspect the cemetery and war memorial, where we were to return the next morning for the dawn service. We then visited Amiens.</para>
<para>As you know, Mr President, the Anzac Day dawn service was held at the Villers Bretonneux War Memorial and Military Cemetery. It is estimated that more than 3,000 people were in attendance, many of them Australians of all ages. The President of the Senate, Senator the Hon. John Hogg, laid a wreath on behalf of the Parliament of Australia. Following a very moving service, we attended a breakfast reception and a further wreath-laying ceremony at the village war memorial. We then moved on to Petite Croix for a further wreath-laying ceremony at a small roadside memorial overlooking the land where battles were held. Bullecourt was our next stop, with another ceremony and an address by Senator Hogg. We then walked to the Australian digger memorial, where I was asked to lay a wreath on behalf of the Australian government.</para>
<para>Later that day we travelled to Ypres, in Belgium, where we completed the Anzac Day formalities by attending the last post ceremony at the Menin Gate. This ceremony has been held every night since July 1928. The bugles fell silent during the years of German occupation in World War II. The bugle call rang out again on 6 September 1944, the day the Germans left town. There is a story that one of the locals, one of the old prewar buglers, was sought out and encouraged to sound the last post for the first time in a liberated Ypres. Afterwards, British soldiers who had heard the sound supposedly sought him out and got him roaring drunk. Another story has it that he was already pretty inebriated by the time he got to the Menin Gate and, once there, encouraged by British, Polish and Canadian servicemen, he sounded the last post no fewer than six times! This nightly memorial is run by volunteers. It was indeed a privilege to be asked to read <inline font-style="italic">The Ode</inline> at this event. Anzac Day 2010 is a day I know everyone on the delegation will remember for a long time.</para>
<para>Anzac Day is probably Australia’s most important national occasion. It marks the anniversary of the first major military action fought by Australian and New Zealand forces during the First World War. It was a great honour to be part of the official ceremonies in France and Belgium. The heartfelt hospitality and friendship of the French and Belgian officials was truly appreciated by all members of the delegation.</para>
<para>During the following days, meetings were held at the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Belgian Senate. These meetings were both informal and formal, allowing delegation members the opportunity to meet with other members of the parliament and their staff. Over the next two days, we attended the first Australia-EU interparliamentary meeting as a guest of the Delegation for Relations with Australia and New Zealand. The agenda was quite broad. It included issues such as EU-Australian relations, including progress on implementation of the Partnership Framework; trade liberalisation and agriculture, including the WTO Doha round; FTAs and prospects for further reform of the common agricultural policy; the global financial crisis; integration of immigrants in the EU and Australia; minority issues; human rights; and foreign affairs.</para>
<para>Prior to leaving Australia, members of the delegation had been requested to prepare a presentation on one of the topics. My presentation was on the global financial crisis, including Australian and EU responses, economic difficulties in some of the Eurozone countries and the role of the G20. I was able to give a background on the strength of the Australian financial system and the government stimulus package which enabled Australia to weather the global financial crisis. As Europe is Australia’s largest trading partner—almost one-third of foreign direct investment in Australia is sourced from the EU—the discussions were of particular relevance. Wide-ranging discussions at these sessions were of great interest to all present.</para>
<para>One of the really important issues through these discussions was that the visit was a parliamentary delegation, as opposed to a government delegation, and it was bipartisan. Our visit and discussions brought to the fore the importance of parliamentary relationships and reciprocal visits and the need for face-to-face interaction.</para>
<para>While we were in Belgium we were also able to visit the Belgian Senate. Although they were in parliamentary recess, it was a useful opportunity to undertake discussions on matters of mutual interest, especially as we had spent the previous two days with the European Parliament and its members. In Germany the delegation met with a range of commercial and international organisations in Bonn and Cologne. Here the focus changed to research innovation, energy security, climate change, sustainable energy and smart technologies as well as strategies to combat desertification. The delegation visited a number of private sector companies and met with United Nations representatives.</para>
<para>We visited the offices of the European Commission—the executive arm of the European Union—and had discussion with staff from the office of the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science. This is a relatively new position, established in November 2009, and has the aim of improving cooperation in science and innovation. There was an obvious spirit of goodwill, and the European Commission is eager to encourage greater cooperation in the areas of food science, information communication technology and health. There was also discussion around intellectual property and audit processes.</para>
<para>While in Bonn, the delegation visited a company manufacturing solar panels where a briefing was given by both our hosts and an overview provided on the growing use of solar power in Australia, in the context of readily available coal resources supplying traditional large power stations. Interestingly, the growing availability of solar panels, the problems associated with quality control in a global market and the need for development of standards were discussed. The next day we were able to inspect a solar testing laboratory in Cologne where we were also able to view panels being put through a range of tests to ensure compliance. While in Germany we also attended the German Aerospace Centre just outside Cologne. Here a wide range of energy research activities for civilian and military purposes are undertaken with the focus on linking research to practical applications. We were also able to tour a prototype solar furnace which is capable of cutting through steel.</para>
<para>The delegation visited the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change office, where a frank discussion was held on current perspectives on climate change, Australia’s approach and the global situation since the Copenhagen summit in December 2009. We also met with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification office. This office, funded by the World Bank, is developing a 10-year strategy which is already leading to reform processes. It is anticipated that approximately two billion people are affected by this issue, and it was noted that Australian expertise is highly regarded in areas such as agriculture.</para>
<para>In the short time I have left to speak, I would like to record my thanks to many people. Firstly, I thank the Parliamentary Library staff for their briefings, both oral and in writing. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were also of great help in providing advice on subjects related to their many areas of expertise. The Parliamentary Relations Office staff went to extraordinary lengths to rearrange travel plans and keep members of the delegation informed of the numerous changes following the eruption of the volcano in Iceland. Their hard work and good humour is greatly appreciated. To the parliaments, governments and dignitaries of the various countries, I would like to say thank you for your time and goodwill. I would also like to thank the staff of all the Australian posts who assisted us with briefings and our general day-to-day inquiries. Finally, can I say thank you to Ms Julia Clifford and Mr Brien Hallett for their great help throughout the tour; they accompanied us to assist us. Finally, to the President himself, the Hon. John Hogg: thank you for your company, friendship, advice and willingness to share knowledge and for facilitating in a most equitable manner a very successful mission. Without the generosity of spirit and hard work of all of those people and organisations the delegation would not have been the great success it was. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</motion>
<para class="block">I will make my comments short because I know this has been a long day. I note the response from Ms Mary McDonald, First Assistant Secretary, from the Department of Health and Ageing to the motion passed by the Senate on 12 May on Bisphenol A, commonly known as BPA. As I have highlighted in this place before, tests are showing, and there is a great deal of concern about, the impact that this particular contaminant has on babies. It is found in plastics that make things like babies bottles and teething rings. I note that the motion on 12 May asked the government to reassess the potential impacts of BPA, particularly following reports from the Australian institute that highlighted the potential health impacts of BPA in products and the concerns raised about inadequate testing for BPA in products used for babies and how that contaminant can then go into the milk in babies bottles.</para>
<para>I note that the government seems to rely on the fact that major retailers such as Coles, Kmart, Target, Woolworth, Big W and Aldi said that they are voluntarily phasing out products containing BPA. While this is good, the fact is that these bottles can still be bought in other stores. I myself, to find out whether these products were still available, went into a number of chemists and was able to purchase babies bottles that contain BPA. So while we congratulate the major retailers for taking some action on this, the fact is that, sorry, government is not off the hook because these products are still available. Until a more widespread effort is made to ensure that these products are totally phased out from all chemists and all retailers, our babies will still be exposed to potential contamination with BPA.</para>
<para>This is advance notice that I will be bringing another motion back to this place about dealing with those retailers that have not phased out BPA. We cannot rely on voluntary action because obviously some retailers are not carrying out what I think is their responsibility to Australian families, and that is phasing out these products. So we will be bringing something back to this place to ask the government to take further action to require these products to be withdrawn.</para>

<motion>
<para>That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death of Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and places on record its appreciation of their service to our country and tenders its profound sympathy to their families and friends in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Senators and all Australians would be aware of the loss of these five Australian defence personnel since the Senate last met. Their service has been acknowledged. The funerals have occurred and due respect has been shown, but we think it is important that the Senate formally record its appreciation of their service and extend our sympathies to the families, friends and defence colleagues of those five Australian soldiers. We have seen significant loss of personnel in Afghanistan, 21 in total, but obviously these most recent five losses bring home the sacrifice and commitment of our defence personnel and the risks they take.</para>
<para>I want to acknowledge, first of all, the loss of Private Nathan Bewes, who was 23. He joined the Army in 2005. On completion of his recruit and infantry basic training he was posted to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, in Brisbane. Private Bewes completed a deployment to East Timor in 2006 and was on his second deployment with the First Mentoring Task Force in Afghanistan at the time of his death. To his parents, Gary and Kaye; to his sister, Stephanie; and to his partner, Alice Walsh, please accept our deepest sympathies.</para>
<para>The second person I want to place some remarks about on the record is Trooper Jason Brown. Jason was 29. He joined the Army in 2000. On completion of his recruit and infantry basic training he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. In 2004 he joined the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, the Commandos. Trooper Brown became a member of the Special Air Service Regiment after successfully completing that most searching selection course in 2007. He was deployed in June 2010 for the first time to Afghanistan as a member of the Special Operations Task Group. To Jason’s parents, Graham and Ann; and to his sister, Stephanie, our deepest sympathies.</para>
<para>Private Tomas Dale was also killed in action. He was just 21. He joined the Army in 2007. After successfully completing his recruit and infantry basic training he was posted to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. This was Private Dale’s first operational deployment. To his parents, Karen and David; and to his brothers, Samuel and Joe, our deepest sympathies.</para>
<para>Private Grant Kirby was 35 when he was killed while serving his country. He joined the Army in 2006. After successfully completing his recruit and infantry basic training he was posted to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. This was Private Kirby’s first deployment to Afghanistan. However, it was his second deployment to the Middle East. He had previously been deployed to East Timor and Iraq. To his parents, Gary and Dianne, and Jo-Anne; his sister, Lauren; his brothers, Luke and Shaun; his former partner, Edwina; and his two daughters, Isabella and Madeleine, our deepest sympathies on your terrible loss.</para>
<para>Finally, I want to pay tribute to Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. He was 28 when he joined the Army in 2002 and in the same year he successfully completed his recruit training. In 2003 he completed his infantry training, prior to being posted to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. This was his third deployment to the Middle East and his second to Afghanistan. I want to convey to his wife, Beckie; his daughter, Annabell; his son, Noah; his parents, Terry, Jane and Ian; and his siblings, Caleb, Jordan, Meg and Charlotte, our deep sympathies and condolences on his loss.</para>
<para>These five men have been laid to rest, but it is important that we in the parliament acknowledge their sacrifice. We will remember these five men, each from different backgrounds, who came together to serve in the Australian Defence Force and give to their country. They did so willingly, deliberately choosing to serve their country in what they knew was a dangerous mission.</para>
<para>The government takes its responsibility in committing troops to combat very seriously—I know every member of this parliament takes that responsibility very seriously—and the burden of those decisions, the burden of knowing what we ask of our defence personnel and the risks that they take. The loss of life brings home the seriousness and the import of these decisions. We know that not every Australian or indeed every member of the parliament necessarily accepts the wisdom of our presence in Afghanistan. That is obviously part of our democracy: that people have different views about this. But I do know the parliament is united in paying its respects to those who serve us and in paying its respects to those who have lost their lives and expressing its sympathy to their families, friends and colleagues.</para>
<para>We will shortly have a parliamentary debate on the subject of our ongoing involvement in Afghanistan. That is as it should be in a democracy; we ought to be able to debate these issues. I look forward to that debate because I think it will be useful to have proper consideration of all those issues. I am sure that will occur in the spirit of total support for our troops and recognition of the commitment they show. Obviously the government will argue that Australia’s mission to Afghanistan is essential for us to defeat the Taliban and the terrorist forces that are using it as a safe haven. As I say, we will have that debate in this place.</para>
<para>Today we want to honour the courage of these men, and their 16 colleagues, who have given their lives in pursuit of this mission. We have, as I said earlier, lost 21 soldiers in Afghanistan—historically, a large loss. Those 21 men have paid the ultimate price for maintaining the security of this nation and the world. I would like to reinforce to their families our gratitude for the sacrifice they have also made. I think all of us who have seen the television coverage as well as those of us who have attended the funerals have been moved by the real, personal impact of these losses on families and friends. Seeing the children left behind by some of these men made a real impact on me and many other members of parliament. We know that the families have to share the burden of their loved one’s decision to serve in our Defence Force, and these families are obviously now suffering after the tragic loss that they have experienced.</para>
<para>We know the magnitude of your loss, and the nation grieves with you. But you should take some comfort from knowing that this government and this parliament will continue to offer you their full support. Australia is deeply indebted to these five young men, and we acknowledge the tremendous sacrifice that they have made.</para>
<para>I wish to note the tragic toll on the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, who have particularly suffered, having lost four of the five serving men who died recently—a huge hit to the 6th Battalion. We recognise their ongoing contribution and express our sympathies over what has been, I know, a terrible period for that very proud battalion.</para>
<para>I would also like to acknowledge the role of former defence minister Senator Faulkner in supporting the families of defence personnel. I think his commitment to those families and his support of them in their time of grief has been fantastic. There is a long tradition of defence ministers doing that, but I think his commitment has been quite obvious. I also acknowledge the continuing support of Senator Johnston and the opposition in this regard. I know Senator Faulkner took his role very seriously and had to bear the burden of those terrible losses. I know the Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston, an outstanding Australian, also carries the burden of the loss of those men, who were ultimately under his command, and I know the whole of the Australian Defence Force mourns the loss of these men and feels it very deeply indeed. Minister Smith, the new Minister for Defence, will of course carry on supporting the defence forces in this way. We will ensure to every extent possible that our troops are supported in every way possible while they undertake this mission for the nation.</para>
<para>I finish by saying that, clearly, the parliament will always acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of these five men. We acknowledge the suffering of their families but urge them to take great pride in the sacrifice offered by their loved ones. We record our appreciation of and our sympathy for their loss.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, and all opposition senators, I express my support for and endorse completely Senator Evans’s remarks in this condolence motion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Over a seven-week period Australia, tragically, lost five of its finest on the battlefields of Afghanistan, bringing our casualty list numbers, sadly, to 21 since the conflict began in 2001. On 9 July we lost Private Nathan John Bewes. He was serving with the Brisbane based 6th Battalion Mentoring Taskforce 1 when he lost his life from an improvised explosive device. Nathan was born in Kogarah, New South Wales, in 1986. He joined the Royal Australian Army in 2005 and in the same year successfully completed his recruit and infantry basic training period prior to being posted to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. This was his third overseas deployment and his second to the Middle East.</para>
<para>Just a month later, on 13 August, we lost Trooper Jason Thomas Brown from the Perth based Special Air Service Regiment. Jason was part of a combined Australian and Afghan patrol conducting operations in northern Kandahar at the time of the incident. His death was a very sad reminder of the dangers faced by our soldiers in Afghanistan on a daily, hour-by-hour basis and the risks that they take on behalf of our country to make Afghanistan a better place.</para>
<para>Seven short days thereafter, on 20 August, we had the terrible news that two more Australian soldiers, Private Tomas Dale, 21, and Private Grant Kirby, 35, of the First Mentoring Task Force in Afghanistan were killed in action when they were struck by an improvised explosive device. Both soldiers were also from the Brisbane based 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. Tomas and Grant had dismounted from their Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle when they were fatally struck by the detonation of the explosive device. The deaths of Private Tomas Dale and Grant Kirby so soon after the recent death of Trooper Jason Brown was a stark and tragic reminder of the dangers and courageous work Australian defence personnel undertake every day in Afghanistan.</para>
<para>However, further tragedy was to strike just three days later on 24 August when Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, also from the Brisbane based 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, was killed in a firefight with Taliban insurgents in the Tangi Valley. Jared joined the Air Force Cadets at Amberley as a youngster and was named most outstanding cadet before joining the Royal Australian Regiment. However, what makes Jared’s death even more pointed and tragic is that his wife, Beckie, gave birth to their second child on the very day of his funeral.</para>
<para>I attended these gallant Australians’ funerals with my colleague Senator Faulkner; my leader, Tony Abbott; and the Prime Minister. I have to say that each and every one of them was an extremely sad, tragic, draining and emotional event. However, in every case, the mums, dads, brothers, sisters, friends and relations, in their eulogies, said how proud they were of their son or brother. They also said how committed each was to taking the fight up to the Taliban in Afghanistan because they overwhelmingly believed that they were fighting a just battle for a just cause.</para>
<para>I share with senators our nation’s gratitude to these gallant Australians. Their contribution to our national security is forever acknowledged and be assured that they will be remembered by all Australians forever. On behalf of coalition senators, I offer heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of Private Bewes, Trooper Brown, Private Dale, Private Kirby and Lance Corporal MacKinney.</para>

<para>—I rise today to concur with the remarks of Senator Evans and Senator Johnston. Whilst we were going through an election, these people’s families have gone through a far greater turmoil with the loss of these loved and gallant men. It has also been an extremely bad time out at Enoggera Barracks for the Brisbane based 6th Battalion, RAR, losing four colleagues, and for the SAS Regiment based in Perth.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Without repeating the remarks on their service, these men and their families have paid the supreme sacrifice in the defence of our nation although not on our shores. Their lives were lost but not wasted. It is extremely important that our parliament continues to completely concur with the belief that their service was of ultimate worth in the protection of the people of Australia and that our forces seek out and close with the enemy on the enemy’s shores and not on ours.</para>
<para>Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, who was 28 years old and with so much of his life ahead of him, has paid the supreme sacrifice. The lives of Private Grant Kirby and Tomas Dale were taken by an improvised explosive device—such a cruel mechanism that has claimed a number of Australian lives. It requires absolute and incredible bravery for those people, who not only know the prospect of imminent danger but see it and know exactly what can happen to them if things go wrong, to go forward. They have recent recollections of colleagues who have been killed and yet these brave Australians continue to go forward despite these absolutely cruel and inhumane devices which, we have to acknowledge, if they do not kill soldiers then they kill children, they kill other people and they kill innocent bystanders.</para>
<para>Trooper Jason Brown, who was also 29 years old and with so much of his life ahead of him, was a brilliant soldier and a member of the SAS. He was a person who had a great deal of pride in his position as a soldier. He saw himself as a warrior. As his father stated, he was a person who did not ask for acknowledgement; just respect for the service he gave. That is something that we are doing here right now. Private Nathan Bewes was another who was tragically killed by an improvised explosive device. All these people leave behind families, wives and children—tragically, Jared MacKinney did not meet his own child who was born on the day of his funeral.</para>
<para>It is so important that we give recognition of the lives they laid down for our nation in a way that we cannot even hope to comprehend and we hope never to have to emulate. We hope that no-one in our family ever has to experience this. Yet these soldiers have done it on our behalf so that we do not have to do it. We must now acknowledge the pain and the grief that their families are suffering. That pain and grief will be a reminder to them every time they see a spare bedroom, every time they see a photo on the wall and every time they go through the cupboards and see the clothes of their former lovers, partners—people that they have known. This section of their life has been taken away. We must acknowledge those children growing up not having the experience of a father who can take them to the footy or cricket. Other people in their lives will now have to play those roles in proxy for their father that was lost.</para>
<para>These are the ongoing sacrifices that these families make that go beyond the sacrifice that was made by the men who were killed. These sacrifices must be remembered in this chamber and they must be remembered by our nation. We must always honour their sacrifice because if they had not made that sacrifice then, within time, we would have had to make it on our shores.</para>

<para>—I join with other members in expressing the greatest and most unreserved sympathy for and empathy with the families, the loved ones, the battalion mates and comrades, and the communities who have lost these five brave Australians from their midst—Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. They have died in the service of this great nation and their courage and their sacrifice will be in the annals of the history of this nation forever.</para>

<para>Their commitment has our unreserved respect. The loss now suffered by their families brings with it the unreserved sympathy of every member of this parliament. I hope that healing, as best it can, comes to their friends and loved ones so that life may get back on track and hope can be brought to future happiness for all those who are suffering now. These five young Australians have lost their lives so recently—since this Senate was last in session—and we hope their loved ones can move on and find future happiness avail again. Five brave young Australians are gone and our sympathy extends to all their loved ones.</para>

<para>—Since the parliament last met, since this Senate was last in session, five young Australians have lost their lives in Afghanistan, as we have heard—Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. They were fine young soldiers and brave young men. They were not only soldiers but also sons, brothers, partners, husbands and fathers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is the responsibility of the government, as every senator in this chamber knows, to protect Australia and Australians. But, as always when Australia’s security is safeguarded by force of arms, the burden of hardship and danger is shouldered by our men and women in uniform and the cost is borne by their families, their friends and their loved ones.</para>
<para>I have always had the greatest respect and admiration for the men and women of the ADF, a respect and admiration that grew during my time as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel in the Keating government. But I am sure that those of us who have had the honour to serve as Australia’s defence minister understand the particular sense of responsibility to the servicemen and women that role brings. One of the great privileges of serving as defence minister is the opportunity to meet so many of our serving soldiers, sailors and aircrew around the country and on deployment overseas. Their courage, their dedication to their country and their supreme professionalism, I can only say, has to be seen to be believed. Their dedication to their mates, their generosity of spirit and their very Australian trait of keeping their sense of humour in even the worst situations makes it unarguable that the spirit of Anzac is alive and well in our modern armed forces.</para>
<para>They do a magnificent job here in Australia and protecting our interests overseas, often very far overseas. They and their families bear long separations, the dislocation of the posting cycle and the constant awareness that they are doing very dangerous work. They do this work on behalf of all of us, and we should remember that our own safety is guaranteed by men and women giving up their own. We can be confident that our own families will return home at the end of the day because thousands of soldiers spend so many months away from their families. Those families endure anxious days and nights so we can lead our lives without such fears. They live with the daily reality of war so we can live with the daily blessing of peace.</para>
<para>I will not forget and none of us must ever forget the sacrifice of Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney in Afghanistan. I will never forget Private Benjamin Ranaudo, Sapper Jacob Moerland, Sapper Darren Smith, Private Timothy Aplin, Private Scott Palmer and Private Benjamin Chuck. I will never forget, as none of us should ever forget, the other 10 Australians who died in Afghanistan and the 150 who were wounded serving our nation there. Nor will I ever forget and nor must any of us ever forget those who have served and continue to serve our nation with such bravery.</para>

</talker>
<para>—As the Labor senator for the ACT I recently had the privilege to see first hand the tremendous and important work childcare professionals do. As part of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union Big Steps in Child Care campaign I worked a day in the life of a childcare worker at the Bruce Ridge Early Childhood Centre. This experience brought home to me the many challenges faced on a daily basis by childcare professionals and the importance of the LHMU Big Steps in Child Care campaign.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Big Steps in Child Care campaign is about standing up for childcare professionals. It is about recognising childcare professionals’ skills and the need for financial support for training. The shortage of childcare professionals is also a high priority after what I believe was substantial neglect during the years of the former Howard government. Childcare professionals through their union want a government that is committed to introducing consistent national quality standards and career paths with better pay for workers. In the ACT we currently have over 1,400 childcare professional staff with a total of 687 vacant positions and a job turnover rate of 47 per cent, which is lower than South Australia’s job turnover rate of 60 per cent but still higher than the average of other Australian states.</para>
<para>I have given my personal commitment to the members of the union to be a LHMU Big Steps childcare champion. I support their campaign for better wages and better access to the upskilling opportunities and will do my best within government to help achieve these positive outcomes. Like so many working parents here in Canberra and elsewhere in Australia I have relied on the essential services provided by dedicated childcare professionals over many years. In fact, I still utilise the services of after-school care for my youngest child. I have long campaigned for improvements to wages and conditions in the childcare sector but I have to say that walking in the shoes of a childcare professional in this small way—and it was a few hours of very challenging work—meant I experienced what it was like to perform such important work. It was a privilege to be able to experience this and it reminded me of how challenging and wonderfully rewarding and complex it is to deal with young children at such an important phase of their development.</para>
<para>With a Labor government federally and in the ACT, it is a great opportunity to look extensively into the challenges facing the childcare sector and to build on the reforms that both the ACT and federal Labor governments have already implemented. I am proud to be part of a Gillard Labor government that is delivering on our commitment to child care. The Labor government have driven an ambitious and unprecedented national reform agenda for early childhood education and child care, because we understand that a child’s experience in the early years can set the course for the rest of the child’s life. We understand that professionals in child care and early education play a critical role in ensuring that children have good quality experiences in child care and they help each child to learn and develop. That is why this government is committed to reforms to lift the quality of child care and early education, including improvements to staff-child ratios so that each childcare professional has more time to spend with each individual child.</para>
<para>As part of these reforms the government is providing opportunities for dedicated and experienced childcare professionals to gain new qualifications. This includes $115 million to remove TAFE fees for childcare diplomas and advanced diplomas to support over 8,000 people per year, including existing childcare professionals, to gain a vocational education and training qualification in early childhood education.</para>
<para>In relation to pay and conditions, the Gillard Labor government has restored a strong safety net for all Australian workers through the modern awards system. Federal Labor welcomes engagement with the LHMU with regard to the low-paid bargaining stream introduced under the Fair Work Act. This stream gives access to bargaining for workers in sectors where it has been difficult to gain the benefits of enterprise bargaining. It is another important part of delivering on our commitment to a fair go for all Australian workers.</para>
<para>Overall the Gillard Labor government is investing a record $17.1 billion in early childhood education and child care over the next four years. This is $10 billion more than the last four years of the former coalition government. We are committed to the early years and to ensuring that each childcare professional can provide children with the high-quality care and attention we all know they need and deserve. The Gillard Labor government are delivering on our commitment to raise the quality of early childhood education and child care, with $630,000 being provided here in the ACT by the federal government over four years to develop sector training, development and support.</para>
<para>In December 2009, the Council of Australian Governments endorsed a new National Quality Framework which will, firstly, improve staff-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention; secondly, introduce staff qualification requirements so that staff are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and to help them learn and develop; thirdly, include a new ratings system so that parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices; and, fourthly, reduce the regulation burden so that services have to deal with only one regulator. These national quality reforms have been developed in close consultation with the early childhood education and childcare sector. Because the changes are being introduced over a number of years, services will have time to adjust and there should be no sudden increase in costs to families.</para>
<para>The Access Economics modelling on the quality reforms shows that these significant quality reforms would increase fees—if passed on by the childcare centre—for long day care, per child, per day by only $1.83 in 2010, $2.35 in 2011 and $3.44 in 2012. These costs have also been offset by a significant increase in the child care tax rebate by the federal Labor government to 50 per cent of the cost of child care, which has decreased childcare fees for parents by 20 per cent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</para>
<para>The ACT Labor government has signed up, with every other state and territory, to the COAG national quality agenda. ACT providers that have already improved staff-child ratios report that the improvements in quality of care for children are significant, that staff are less stressed and that the turnover of staff is reduced. These are very positive outcomes as a result of these reforms. The ACT government has also implemented, as of 1 July this year, a portable long service leave scheme for childcare professionals. This will ensure that childcare sector workers can move between centres and keep their fundamental entitlement to long service leave, allowing it to accrue overtime, boosting the attraction and retention of employees to the sector.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I would like to report to the Senate that I signed a pledge which commits me to continue my advocacy for childcare professionals, including their campaign for wage justice. I would like to pay my respects to the work of the LHMU in their representation of childcare professionals and their efforts to continue to progress the agenda of childcare reform nationally. I would particularly like to thank Yvette Berry from the LHMU here in the ACT; Jessica from Bruce Ridge; and Alyce, also from Bruce Ridge, for their forbearance and encouragement when I walked in their shoes, and I thank all the other staff and, of course, the children, who were terrific the whole morning at my day in the life of a childcare professional. I learnt a lot that day, and I pay my respects to childcare professionals throughout Australia.</para>

<para>—I rise to pay tribute to the life of a good friend of mine who passed away last week, Councillor Mike Downie, mayor of the Central Coast Council in the north-west of Tasmania. Mike was born in 1945 and spent his formative years in Victoria. He worked as a plumber around the Collingwood area of Melbourne where, unfortunately, he came into contact with asbestos, and it was that which finally took Mike’s life last week.</para>

<para>Mike and his wife, Kath, came to Tasmania from Victoria in the early 1970s and took over the store at South Riana. They fell in love with that district and, as I understand it, never sought to reside anywhere else. In fact, one of Mike’s last wishes was that he be able to die at home, and fortunately that wish was able to be facilitated. Mike and Kath settled in the district, raised a family, and Mike became a significant identity in that community.</para>
<para>He first ran for local government in 1979 and went on to represent his community for 29½ years in local government—making a significant contribution over many years to that community. When the Penguin municipality was combined with Ulverstone, he went on to maintain a position on what became the Central Coast Council. So he was a councillor for the Penguin Municipal Council from 1979 to 1991, including three years as treasurer, and he was a councillor on the Central Coast Council from 1993 until 2010. He was deputy mayor from 1996 to 1998 and he was mayor from 1998 until 2010. He made a huge contribution over that time to his local community and he was obviously respected by that community, because they continued to elect him as their leader for 12 years.</para>
<para>He was also a founding council representative on the Cradle Coast Authority, an organisation which was formed in 1999 to take over from the then north-west municipal councils association. It was an organisation that was set up with a very different structure: one where the councillors formed a council representatives group and set the policy for the region. A board appointed by that group made the local decisions. It has proved to be a very insightful structure for the region, because it took a lot of the local politics and the parochial politics out of the decision making for the region.</para>
<para>Mike, I think, was the chair of the council representatives group from the outset of that organisation until quite recently, but he is regarded quite rightly as one of the founding fathers of the Cradle Coast Authority. Roger Jaensch, the executive chairman, said last week:</para>
<quote>
<para>We are going to miss him terribly … He was one of the people who worked very hard to get the idea up and get it right. … And once the authority was formed he held it to account at every turn.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And that was very much the way of Mike. Even though he was part of setting something up, he was always prepared to ask the hard questions and he was always prepared to ensure that an organisation was operating in line with community expectations.</para>
<para>He was a member of many local government bodies—including, the Premier’s Local Government Council from May 2002 to June 2008 and from May this year until September this year, when he passed away. He was a member of the general management committee of the Local Government Association of Tasmania and Cradle Coast Authority representatives group. He was also a council owner representative on the board of the newly created Cradle Mountain Water.</para>
<para>Obviously Mike’s passing has drawn tributes from a number of identities. I know that the Premier and the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania paid tribute to his family on his passing. But I think Jan Bonde—Mike’s fellow councillor and the acting mayor at the moment—got it right when she made some very poignant comments in our local paper in the last couple of days. She wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para>Mike will be missed around the council table for his unsurpassed knowledge of local government affairs, his ability to ask the hard questions and stand up for his community, his strong leadership and great sense of humour. In the office, Mike loved to chat with staff, especially when Collingwood had a win, and his easy and friendly manner will be sadly missed …</para>
<para>Mike was a mayor for the people. He loved talking to people, whether in the street helping ratepayers resolve issues or attending the many community functions and events where he always had a joke to share and a positive word. He led by example, wearing his ‘Hello’ badge proudly and believing that our community would be a better place if we lifted our heads, smiled and said ‘Hello’.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I have to say I can only agree with Jan, particularly with regard to Mike and his hello badge. It was a feature. He always wore it on his lapel. In fact, he appeared in national media on a couple of occasions promoting the concept that, if we were all prepared to say hello to each other, the place would be a much warmer place to live in and we would all get on so much better. That was very much a mark of Mike and what he was about. He was about being a warm and friendly face within his community.</para>
<para>He was also known for his love of sport. His sons were very adept athletes and were a feature of the coastal carnivals and you would see Mike at those sorts of events. He took up lawn bowls in the eighties and played division 1 pennant. He also involved himself in the administrative side of local sporting clubs, and as a councillor he worked really hard to see that the Central Coast region had the very best of facilities for the region’s sports. I know that one of the things he was really proud of was the new showgrounds facility that was recently opened at Ulverstone. He did an enormous amount of work with his council to bring the local community together and to actually bring that facility into being. It required a lot of work. There were a lot of groups that had very different perspectives and views on what they wanted as a regional facility, and he managed to bring them all together. He really did work hard to pull those things together.</para>
<para>Mike was also a candidate for state political office in 2002 for the Liberal Party. Unfortunately he was unsuccessful, by virtue of the vagaries of the Hare-Clark system in Tasmania; Mike got quite a good vote but was not elected. It is just one of those things. He maintained his relationships with all sides of politics and was respected by all sides of politics. I know Bryan Green, the Labor member for Braddon in Tasmania, paid significant tribute to Mike after his passing last week. Mike was prepared to give either side a bit of stick if he felt they deserved it—if it was in the interests of his communities. By the same token, if there were accolades to be handed out, they were handed out in equal measure. He was interested in the best interests of his community. And I think that says a lot about the man.</para>
<para>As I said, he had a number of wishes. One was to pass away at home, and I am delighted that he was able to do that. Another was to die in office, and again it is a mark of the kind of person Mike was that his council facilitated that—he was highly respected. He did not want his illness to be prolonged, and, thankfully, it was not; but he was expected to have more time. Unfortunately that was not the case, and we were all a bit surprised when Mike passed away last week. I suspect too that he wanted to see Collingwood win a flag—he was a great Collingwood supporter—but unfortunately he was taken a little bit too soon to see that happen.</para>
<para>I pass my condolences on to his wife, Kath, who was always at Mike’s side at community events and continues to work for her community, and to their children, Andrew, David, Michelle and Vanessa. Mike was a significant contributor and character within our community, and he was taken from us much too soon.</para>

</talker>
<para>—It is with some sadness that I rise tonight to pay a small tribute to Neil Bessell, who was one of the Senate team. He was a colleague of us all and a friend to many of us. Neil passed away suddenly and unexpectedly by a brief but very serious illness between the last sitting of the Senate and this one. They were tragic circumstances which took a life far too early. I had the honour and privilege to attend Neil’s funeral on behalf of the government, and I acknowledge that Senators Parry and Abetz also attended on behalf of the opposition.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When we get to know people through our work and become friends with them, a lot of the knowledge we have of them has to do with our work environment—the travel we may have done together or the committee work we may have done together—and sometimes we all too easily fail to acknowledge that they have a life outside their work as well. I learned at the funeral that Neil was also a family man, a father, a great sportsman, great fun in his academic life and had lots of interests outside of this place as well as being incredibly dedicated to it. I pay tribute to his family, to Cleaver Elliott and to others who contributed to his funeral, because it was a great tribute to and a great celebration of Neil’s life. We smiled, we laughed and we were able to shed a tear as well. To all those involved, it was a tribute to Neil. I know that if there was an afterlife and he was able to look back and he was looking down at the funeral, he would have enjoyed the celebration of his life and the tribute that was paid to it.</para>
<para>Neil Bessell was a parliamentary officer through and through. He dedicated his professional career—a career which we can all vouch was marked by passion, enthusiasm and commitment—to serving senators and the Senate. In his own words, he was, ‘Here to please, here to serve.’ To Neil, it was a privilege and a pleasure to serve the Senate and its senators. Neil joined the Senate in Old Parliament House in 1985 to work as a researcher on the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. After that he served as publications officer in the table office, and within two years he was assigned as secretary to the then new Select Committee on Agriculture and Veterinary Chemicals. As many may know, this committee was very successful, and it was while under his administration that it mutated into the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport which still operates today.</para>
<para>After working on this committee, Neil was assigned to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, where he set records both for the number of reports produced in a year and for managing the first of the Senate’s mega inquiries: the inquiry into euthanasia, which received more than 12,000 submissions. Senators should remember that this occurred before the advent of the easy, push-of-a-button email submissions which we get today. It was during this time that Neil commenced serving as a clerk at the table of the Australian Senate and training under the watchful eye of the current Clerk of the Senate for a position which was to mean so much to him for the next 12 years. There in the cockpit of the Senate, in the centre of the great debates and the lawmaking history of our time, he served our needs as senators.</para>
<para>Soon after completing his time as Secretary to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Neil took up the substantial responsibilities of Senior Clerk of Committees. It was in this position that he really blossomed. As a supervisor with a thorough knowledge of all aspects of the work which he expected of his staff, he was a great mentor, an excellent trainer, a great resolver of interpersonal difficulties between team members and at all times a compassionate supervisor. Neil was a great exponent of the art of making sure that his work met the needs of senators. He would say, ‘We are biros for hire.’ It was his constant refrain. His personal views were never relevant; he was writing for senators and reflecting their views. He was the consummate impartial parliamentary officer.</para>
<para>Neil’s last assignment in the department was as Director of Journals and Notice Papers, recording the minutes of the Senate for posterity. Once again, his skill in building bridges came to the fore, and he accomplished the important work in a small department of getting teams to understand and contribute to each other’s workload to the overall benefit of senators and the Senate. During his service as a Senate officer, Neil served six presidents of the Senate: the Hons. Doug McClelland, Kerry Sibraa, Michael Beahan, Paul Calvert, Alan Ferguson and the present President, John Hogg. All six of them have personally either phoned or emailed the Senate offices to express their condolences and to remark on the contribution which Neil made in assisting them, particularly in his capacity as a delegation secretary and as Secretary of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</para>
<para>I am happy to say that for a couple of years I was a delegate to the Inter-Parlia-mentary Union, and Neil led us. He was incredibly well known in that environment, and to his credit Australia always punched above its weight in that forum. Australian senators in particular, and certainly Neil as a committee secretary, were sought after to lead where possible most of the working groups because of the nature of our democracy, in which senators from different political parties work together to find common ground and produce consensus reports. It is a skill that I think a lot of us here do not appreciate and a skill that not a lot of other parliaments have. It was Neil’s knowledge of the processes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and his skill and experience as a committee secretary in that same environment which led Australians, and him in particular, to be in great demand in the IPU to assist in leading those working parties. Neil’s involvement enabled us to directly influence a lot of the policy development which that body conducts.</para>
<para>A lot of credit has to be paid to Neil, and that is acknowledged in a letter from the Secretary General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to the Speaker, which I have just enough time to read and put on the record. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Dear Mr Speaker,</para>
<para class="block">My colleagues and I were absolutely devastated to learn of the sudden death of our dear friend and colleague Neil Bessell.</para>
<para class="block">We would like to pay homage to his long and devoted service to the IPU. For many years he assisted the Australian delegations to IPU meetings, and more recently organized the meetings of Secretaries of delegations during the Assemblies. He undertook all his tasks with such energy, drive and good humour.</para>
<para class="block">Neil was a truly great guy. He always had a friendly word for all. It was such a pleasure to see him at our meetings and to benefit from his advice and support, always given with a winning smile. We will miss him terribly. His loss will also be keenly felt in the inter-parliamentary community where he made so many friends throughout his long involvement with the IPU.</para>
<para class="block">May I ask you to address our heartfelt condolences to the Parliament and our deepest sympathy to Neil’s family at this very sad time.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And let me pass, on behalf of all senators, our condolences to Neil’s family. The words of the Secretary General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union sum up the high esteem in which they held Neil—the high esteem in which we held Neil—and it is very sad to see a man pass away so early. I considered Neil a friend as well as a colleague. I must say it is devastating when something happens so suddenly and so unexpectedly. Again, our condolences to his family. Congratulations for the way the funeral was conducted, the great tribute and great celebration of Neil’s life and I thank them for the opportunity.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise tonight to speak about the plight of a family on the cusp of losing everything they have worked for. Matt and Janet Thompson came to Australia from the United States in 2001. They had expertise in cattle farming and they applied their life savings to establishing a feedlot in Narrogin in Western Australia. It took a year for them to receive approval from the Department of Environment and Conservation for that feedlot, which is nearly five kilometres from Narrogin. Approval was given for the construction of a feedlot to house up to 15,000 cattle—or slightly less than 15,000 cattle. They invested their time and their money and they are at risk of losing it all.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am advised the Thompson family have broken no law, they have no outstanding environmental infringements, they have done everything asked of them by government, they are popular in their local community and nearby towns, and yet they still face ruin. They run a profitable business—or they ran a profitable business. But an over-officious and what would appear to be an overzealous government bureaucracy has cut the profitability of their business and their ability to access any capital.</para>
<para>We go back: the Thompsons applied for construction approval for a feedlot. They received it and they gradually built their farm up to house more than 10,000 head of cattle by 2007. By all reports it was a very successful business. By all reports they were turning away business because people wanted to tap into their expertise. So they applied to further increase their licence to house the maximum of 15,000 cattle. And this is where the problem came in. They were advised to apply for their licence, which they did, and it took a full 11 months for it to be approved. But the unsettling case is that in 2007 the department started to make further inquiries into the feedlot operations because of complaints about the smell. What I neglected to mention before is that this feedlot is located next to a piggery. The piggery has been in operation for some decades in Narrogin, and apparently in the town some people have been complaining about the smell. They have not been complaining about the piggery smell; they have been complaining about the feedlot smell. I am not quite sure how you determine the smell of a pig versus the smell of a cow when they are located next to each other, but somehow the department has concluded that it is the feedlot that smells.</para>
<para>The end result of this is that rather than continue their licence for 10,000 head of cattle which the Thompson family had invested in—they had entered into contracts for feed and water for those cattle—the licence was cut to 6,000 for the Thompsons’ feedlot operation. They could not sustain that. They could not sustain their operations and fulfil their contractual operations with only 6,000 head of cattle. Everything, all the capital they had invested—some $10 million in input costs in the previous year—had come to nowt because this licence was cut unilaterally.</para>
<para>Even the department, in a meeting with the Thompson family, acknowledged that there are procedures and processes that need to be gone through in order to cut people’s licences. And in a meeting on 15 December 2009 a department official said: ‘This is true. The Thompsons have not been treated in a fair and proper manner by the department. There was no process.’ So there was no appropriate process applied by the government department. There has been no law broken by the Thompson family, and yet they still stand on the cusp of losing everything simply because the department decided to change the conditions of their licence.</para>
<para>In the department’s defence, whatever departmental defence I can mount for them, they did, after some 15 months of stalling, give the Thompson family the ability to have 10,000 head of cattle on their property once again. The difficulty was that the licence was due to expire only months after it had been approved and no bank would lend or advance capital, on the assumption that all licences were in such short-term supply and that there could be a reduction or a change in licence conditions without notice, without due process, at the whim of the department. So the Thompsons have not been able to access the capital necessary to sustain their operations.</para>
<para>Today the Thompson family have administrators at their gates trying to enter their property because they cannot continue their operations, which were approved in the initial instance. The difficulties come because the department has also said that if one complaint about smell is received then the licence can be removed and they will have to reduce the number of cattle on their property again. Primary production business cannot continue to operate like this. When people come to this country, become Australian citizens, raise their families, invest their money, break no laws and establish profitable businesses, why is it that government departments can shut them down without due process?</para>
<para>There are other alarming aspects to the Thompsons’ case. In 2008 they hired attorneys in Perth because they did not think they were going to get a positive outcome from the Department of Environment and Conservation. After the attorneys got up to speed with the case, the solicitor and barrister recommended they meet with a gentleman who was an environmental attorney skilled in property matters such as this, Dr Schoombee. The Thompsons met with Dr Schoombee, who advised them that they had no legal standing for the approval of the original feedlot and that they should apologise to the Department of Environment and Conservation for their initial development. In his advice, which took 40 minutes, Dr Schoombee recommended that he should be continually retained to meet with the department and smooth things over.</para>
<para>By the Thompsons’ account, for the original 40-minute consultation they were charged $4,000—at $100 a minute it is not bad money if you can get it. But people can charge what they like and give the advice that they like as long as it is competent and impartial. What is disturbing is that Dr Schoombee is the convenor of an organisation called the Environmental Defender’s Office. The Environmental Defender’s Office is a non-government organisation, but it is actually funded by government and it advises and teaches a small group of complainants how to file writs and appeals and target businesses or practices with regard to environmental matters. This is all a matter of fact which the Thompsons have put on the record, I believe, at a Western Australian parliamentary inquiry hearing. The fact is that Dr Schoombee is a convenor of the EDO and on its website the EDO lists ‘the fight against Narrogin Beef Producers’, which is the Thompsons’ business, as a major accomplishment in 2008. Dr Schoombee won lawyer of the year, partly for his work with the Environmental Defender’s Office.</para>
<para>I would suggest that something smells in Narrogin, but I do not think it is the Thompsons’ feedlot. Something smells when people come here, invest their money and seek unbiased advice and then find that government departments are running roughshod over people who have not broken any law and have complied with all the environmental requirements made of them and find that individuals who are advising these people on how to deal with their problems are also running organisations which specialise in advising people on how to mount such spurious complaints. Something does smell in Narrogin. Having now raised it in this place, I feel it might be too late for the Thompsons. But there is a lesson for all Australians: we cannot allow government bureaucrats and departments to ride roughshod over common sense and common decency. We cannot allow government to become unruly and unwieldy in its restraint of decent businesses. To do so would send a very poor message, not only to people intent on building up their own investments in Australia but to people who are interested in investing here from overseas, like the Thompsons.</para>
<para>I raise this issue not because I think it can make a great deal of difference to the Thompson family. It may be too late—though I hope it is not. I hope that they can retain their farm and that the people of Narrogin, who have already pledged a great deal of support, will be able to rise up and ensure that this previously successful business can continue to operate. But a point that I think we all need to be aware of is that the way government officials or people in public office respond to constituents is absolutely important. The Thompsons’ case needs to be aired publicly; a number of people are trying to do so. I stand with them and wish Janet and Matt Thompson and their family a successful outcome.</para>

<para>—I rise this evening to talk about a recent event in Alice Springs at which I had the privilege to represent my honourable colleague Senator Carr. Two weeks after the election, on 6 September, representing Senator Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research—and I am pleased to see he is in the chamber this evening to hear what he missed out on—I was lucky enough to be able to open two new facilities at the Desert Knowledge Australia precinct in Alice Springs. The precinct, under its chief executive officer, Mr John Huigen, is developing into a major research and knowledge centre in the heart of Australia. It is a project which has always had my support, so I was very pleased to attend the opening of a new CSIRO office and laboratory building and also the new Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will go first to the CSIRO opening. CSIRO is one of the organisations helping to forge the Desert Knowledge movement, focusing research on useful outcomes with commercial potential for those living in the arid zone. This commenced with researching pastoral production in arid areas and has now evolved to include an understanding of the interwoven social, economic and environmental factors of the outback in order to provide a sustainable lifestyle for those living in the region. Projects based at this site focus on natural resource management, sustainable desert industries and regional development. The impacts of climate change, biodiversity decline, agricultural sustainability and understanding how people interact with this environment are just some of the complex issues scientists at Alice Springs will be addressing. While CSIRO is a national organisation, research outcomes so often rely on local knowledge. It is that local knowledge that staff in this new building in Alice Springs will help to provide. Partners with CSIRO in its research here are Meat and Livestock Australia, the South Australian Research and Development Institute and, of course, the new CRC for Remote Economic Participation.</para>
<para>The federal government has contributed $2.9 million to the cost of this new CSIRO building, which will include houses for up to 20 staff with office and laboratory facilities. It also has the capacity for expansion as new research programs develop. I acknowledge the presence at the opening of that new building of Dr Ashley Sparrow, the CSIRO’s officer in charge at Alice Springs and Dr Andrew Johnson, the CSIRO’s Group Executive, Environment. There were also many supporters of CSIRO research and CSIRO staff themselves present on that day.</para>
<para>Once the new building was opened, I had the privilege of having a walk through and making an inspection of the new offices and laboratories. I met with some terrific scientists and staff there, including Mr Gary Bastin, who is a rangeland ecologist with experience in rangeland monitoring using remote sensing and field-based methods. I also met Mrs Vanessa Chewings, Ms Marita Thomson, Dr Margaret Friedel, Dr Fiona Walsh, Dr Jocelyn Davies and Dr Michael LaFlamme. I also mention Ms Josie Douglas, an Indigenous woman with whom I had time to spend chatting about the research work she is doing. She is an Indigenous research fellow who is particularly interested in social and cultural aspects of regional and remote education, community based micro-enterprises and natural and cultural resource management. She is undertaking her PhD, and I take this opportunity to wish her all the best in that work. It will be a terrific outcome for an Indigenous woman such as her, with the knowledge that she has, to have a PhD in this area.</para>
<para>As was pointed out during the opening by the Northern Territory’s Minister for Central Australia, Karl Hampton, the CSIRO has had a presence in Alice Springs since the early 1950s. We know that there is a lot to innovation and laboratory R&amp;D; however, investment in science and technology is critical to the growth of knowledge-based economies and an important indicator of innovation capacity and performance. The new CSIRO building enables the CSIRO to move into co-location with significant research partners such as the CRC for Remote Economic Participation. Research and innovation are the keys to making Australia more productive and competitive, and the organisations based in the Desert Knowledge Precinct are all playing a part in this. I was therefore very pleased to also be able to launch the new CRC for Remote Economic Participation, which is right next door to the new CSIRO facility and part of the Desert Knowledge Precinct.</para>
<para>CRCs offer a framework for bringing people and resources together to examine and research areas of need. This government understands the importance of collaborations, as demonstrated by the wonderful leadership of the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. That is why we had the CRC program reviewed and made reforms, including research in the areas of humanities and social science in their own right for the first time. The CRC for Remote Economic Participation is one organisation that has benefited from these changes, and is a great example of the value added to the program by the reforms. There are 42 CRCs across Australia, each focusing on particular challenges by bringing together people, resources and end users.</para>
<para>The people of Central Australia live in a pretty unique arid area. For centuries it was peopled only by our First Australians, who developed their own skills and knowledge which enabled them to live successfully, if perhaps basically, in the arid lands. Through this work we acknowledge their ability to live in these arid lands and applaud the skills they had and used. These skills are still useful today, so the Indigenous people of the region have a part to play in modern research, and that is very evident in the CRC for Remote Economic Participation. It is Indigenous people who have the knowledge about plants and animals, climate and water supplies, where they exist. They have the traditional knowledge that can lead and benefit this new CRC.</para>
<para>The CRC began its operations in July this year, and since then it has commenced research to strengthen the economy of the remote region. The CRC wants to see three main outcomes, and these will guide its work: to strengthen the economy of remote regions, to build remote enterprises to provide jobs and livelihoods for people living in remote regions and to improve education and training pathways for people living in remote regions. The CRC has set out to achieve these outcomes by starting to examine more precise pastoral enterprise management, looking at new business opportunities in Aboriginal art and tourism and developing better ways to enable communities to manage risks over the life cycle of a mining operation.</para>
<para>Along with the new CRC came its new logo, based on a painting called <inline font-style="italic">Two Women Learning</inline> by local Indigenous artist Kathleen Wallace. As the artist explained at the opening of the CRC, the painting shows how different people know different parts of a story but can share them with one another to make up the whole—a great metaphor for the partnerships being built by this new CRC. I acknowledge the chair of the new CRC on Remote Economic Participation’s governing board, Mr Paul Wand, Mr Tom Calma, who is the Deputy Chair, and the Managing Director, Jan Ferguson. That is a group of people which steered this CRC into its operation, its coming into being and its eventual launch on 6 September. Other board members whom I acknowledge are Ms Glenise Coulthard, Mr Ian Davey, Mr Harold Furber—who is a traditional and acknowledged Indigenous person from Alice Springs—Ms Tanya Hosch, Ms Alison Page, Mr David Ritchie and Mr Tony Tate.</para>
<para>There is no denying that the CRC for Remote Economic Participation is new, but it is up and running. It is an enthusiastic team of researchers, scientists and people who are willing to collaborate and to work closely with the CSIRO and other partners as well as many stakeholders. I take this opportunity to let the country know that in the centre of Australia there is some great work being done, and it is supported by this government. I wish the new CRC all the very best, and I look forward to my ongoing visits and support and my future consultation and the benefits that I know this CRC will bring, not only to remote Indigenous communities but also to the nation as a whole.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:</para>

<list type="decimal">
<item label=" (1)  (Tables at Attachment A)">
<para/>
<para>Senator McGauran uses the term ‘stress leave’. However, from a medical perspective ‘stress’ is the factor that causes or worsens a psychological disease and therefore Comcare does not use ‘stress leave’ as an injury descriptor.</para>
<para>Comcare examined data from Australian Government employers relating to the number of injured workers who have an accepted compensation claim for psychological disease and who received incapacity compensation for more than one day in respect of that injury, as a proxy of an employee who was/is on ‘stress leave’. The data Comcare uses complies with the National Standard.</para>
</item>
<item label="(a)">
<para>(b) (c) Table 1 provides the total number of accepted claims for psychological disease and the gender of the injured worker, with one day or more incapacity compensation received, as a proxy for ‘stress leave’ for the financial years ending 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009-2010 to date (5 May 2010).</para>
<para>The number of injured workers currently in receipt of incapacity payments is shown against the year their claim was accepted. For example 432 claims for psychological disease were accepted in 2004-2005. Of those claims 65 (15%) injured workers are currently in receipt of weekly compensation payments as a result of their injury. In comparison 131 claims for psychological disease were accepted in 2009-2010 to date. Of those claims 82 (62%) are currently in receipt of weekly compensation. Many of these injured workers have an active rehabilitation program and in the future less of these injured workers will be in receipt of weekly compensation payments.</para>
</item>
<item label="(d)">
<para>(i) The total number of days incapacity for injured workers with a claim for psychological disease and the total cost of those incapacity payments are represented in dollar terms against the year the claim was accepted. The duration and cost of time lost for those injured workers who are not back at work as a result of their injury in 2004-2005 is higher than those who had their claim accepted in 2009-2010 to date.</para>
</item>
<item label="(e)">
<para>The average number of days lost is provided in this Table and the costs provided are actual incapacity costs paid at 5 May 2010. The average does not take into consideration potential future time lost and cost and for this reason a median cost-to-date has been calculated to provide a better measure of central tendency.</para>
</item>
<item label="(g)">
<para>In 2009 -2010 to date the most common reason for psychological disease are (1) work related harassment and/or bullying and (2) work pressure. In the preceding financial years the most common reason was work pressure, followed by work related harassment and/or bullying.</para>
<para>(f ) (i) and (ii) Table 2 provides the 20 highest time lost claims for injured workers who had their claims accepted in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 to 2010 to date. The mechanism that contributed to their injury is also provided.</para>

</item>
<item label="(j)">
<para>The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the Act) does not provide injured workers with a ‘payout’. The only lump sum payments made under this Act are for permanent impairment, death and common law (non economic loss, capped at $110,000). As a proxy for ‘payout’ Table 3 provides the 20 highest incapacity cost-to-date compensation payments received by injured workers, represented in the year their claim for psychological disease was accepted.</para>
</item>
<item label="(h)">
<para>Table 4 provides the total number of psychological disease claims for each Government employer from 2004-2005 to date. Centrelink, Australian Tax Office and Department of Defence combined have over 50 percent of psychological disease claims for that period and are also the three largest Government employers. Agencies that have less than six claims for psychological disease have been categorised as ‘Other agencies’ to protect the privacy of their injured workers who could be identified.</para>
<para>Department of Defence data relates to non-Australian Defence Force (ADF) workers only. Claims made under the Act by members of the ADF are not managed by Comcare. These claims are managed by Department of Veteran’s Affairs, and this data has not been included.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>Answer 2</para>
<para>Injured workers suffering from a psychological disease received the following compensable medical treatment:</para>
<para>- General practitioner</para>

<item label="(3)">
<para>When a claim for compensation is accepted Comcare provides general advice in relation to an injured workers rights and obligations under the Act.</para>
<para>The following publications are available on Comcare’s website at www.comcare.gov.au</para>
<para>- All about workers’ compensation: A guide for employees injured at work before 13 April 2007 (Pub 12);</para>
<para>- All about workers’ compensation: A guide for employees injured at work on or after 13 April 2007 (Pub 71);</para>
<para>- Workers’ compensation: How Comcare determines claims made under the SRC Act (Pub 61) Edition 1; and</para>
<para>- Workers’ compensation: How Comcare determines claims made under the SRC Act (Pub 70) Edition 2.</para>
<para>Comcare also provides workers with on-line information on how Comcare determines initial liability for psychological disease.</para>
<para>Comcare provides advice and support to case workers employed in government departments in returning their injured workers to suitable employment.</para>
<para>Comcare’s health and safety web page provides comprehensive information and links about psychological disease. For example, workers can link to the Beyond Blue web site and Government employers can link to publications such as Recognition resolution and recovery: Early intervention to support psychological health and wellbeing.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Liability for psychological disease, caused or worsened as a result of work place stressors, can be determined under the Act</para>
<para>Most claims for psychological disease are considered under the disease provisions of the Act because they usually are of gradual onset.</para>
<para>For liability to be determined for a disease, employment must have been a significant contributing factor to that disease.</para>
<para>There are some exceptions and exclusions to finding liability for injury (which includes disease). For example liability cannot be accepted if the psychological disease is as a result of reasonable administrative action taken in a reasonable manner. This includes appraisal, counselling, suspension, disciplinary action or as a result of workplace disappointments such as failure to gain promotion, transfer, benefit or promotion, etc.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5) (a)">
<para>When an employee makes a claim for compensation for psychological disease, including a claim for time off work as a result of their injury, the first step is for Comcare to determine liability for the injury.</para>
<para>To determine liability for injury (which includes disease) under the Act, Comcare requires certification from a legally qualified medical practitioner to establish whether the employee suffers from a psychological disease. The diagnosis provided should comply with diagnostic standards for psychiatric injury/illness or disease, in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders v 4 (DSM4). For example ‘adjustment disorder, major depression etc’. The medical certificate should also provide causation (stressors) and their level of contribution to the injury.</para>
<para>Comcare will assess the facts and circumstances of the claim as provided by both the employee and the employer and possibly others to determine whether employment ‘significantly’ contributed or worsened the claimed condition.</para>
<para>Comcare may require a medical opinion from an independent medical specialist and if this is the case Comcare arranges and pays for that examination and report.</para>
<para>Comcare will need to be satisfied that employment has significantly contributed to the claimed injury and that the significant contribution does not fall within the meaning of an exclusionary provision for liability to exist.</para>
<para>If the claim for psychological disease is accepted Comcare can then decide if the time off work claimed is as a result of the compensable injury.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The Act provides for a three tier decision and review process.</para>
<para>Primary Decision</para>
<para>Each primary determination made by Comcare, whether it is about liability for injury or payment of incapacity compensation, must be:</para>
<para>- in writing;</para>
<para>- provide reasons for decision; and</para>
<para>- provide a statement of rights and obligations about reconsideration and review.</para>
<para>Reviewable decision</para>
<para>In the event that a reconsideration of this determination is requested a review will be undertaken by another Comcare delegate. This may involve seeking further information and evidence from the injured worker, their employer, and/or medical practitioners. Each reviewable decision must also be in writing and provide reasons for decision and review rights.</para>
<para>Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)</para>
<para>A review of a reviewable decision is requested by lodging an AAT application. The AAT application is usually heard in the State or Territory where the employee resides. The application will be the subject of at least one conciliation conference. If the application is not resolved between Comcare and the employee, the application will ultimately be heard and determined by a member of the AAT.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>Government workers are covered for workers compensation under the Act. Comcare is the determining authority and the Government employer is the rehabilitation authority under the Act.</para>
<para>The liability provisions of the Act that relate to psychological disease determination are:</para>
<para>Threshold considerations</para>
<para>- Section 54, claims for compensation</para>
<para>- Section 5, persons taken to be employees</para>
<para>- Section 53, failure to provide notice of injury</para>
<para>Medical relationship</para>
<para>- Sub section 14 (1) - liability for injury</para>
<para>- Section 5A – definition of injury</para>
<para>- Section 5B – definition of disease</para>
<para>Employment relationship</para>
<para>- Sub section 5B (2) – contribution to a significant degree by the employee’s employment</para>
<para>Exclusions</para>
<para>- Subsection 14(2) – intentionally self inflicted</para>
<para>- Subsection 14(3) and 4(13) – wilful misconduct</para>
<para>- Subsection 5A (2) – reasonable administrative action taken in a reasonable manner in connection with employment</para>
<para>Provisions that relate to incapacity compensation are in section 19 of the Act.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>There is a time limit on how long an injured worker can be in receipt of weekly incapacity payments.</para>
<para>Incapacity compensation ceases to be paid when an injured worker is 65 years of age, except where an injured worker is 63 years of age or older when injured. If an injured worker is injured when they are 63 years of age or older they may be entitled to a maximum period of 104 weeks incapacity compensation, consecutive or otherwise.</para>
<para>Access to compensation for medical expenses and other entitlements are not restricted by the age of the worker.</para>
<para>Under the Act compensation is only payable if the worker is suffering from the effects of their accepted psychological disease and claims for injury are subject to medical evidence and review. Further to this a claim for compensation for incapacity must meet the tests of those particular provisions.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Under the Act, there is no dollar cap on the total amount of compensation payable.</para>
<para>The Act does set a ceiling for the maximum amount of incapacity compensation payable per week. The maximum is 150% of the Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings of Full-time Adults as published from time to time by the Australian Statistician. The ceiling applies after entitlements have been paid for the first 45 weeks of incapacity.</para>
<para>The AWOTEFA ceiling is currently $1,834.95 per week.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>There has been one occasion, during the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, when the Act has been amended in relation to psychological disease claims. This was by passage of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Act, 2007 (SRCOLA Act) by the previous Government in April 2007.</para>
<para>The definition of disease in the Act was changed so that the required level of employment contribution to enable the finding of workers’ compensation liability for a disease, for example a psychological disease, was increased. Previously the level of employment contribution was required to be to a ‘material’ degree, but following the SRCOLA Act amendment the required level needs to be at a ‘significant’ degree.</para>
<para>The 2007 SRCOLA Act amendment also provided, in the new definition of disease, a list of matters which may be taken into account in considering whether employment had contributed to at least a significant degree. Finally, ‘significant’ was defined in the SRC Act as a degree that is ‘substantially more than material’.</para>
<para>The SRCOLA Act also amended the SRC Act’s definition of injury to widen those employment events or circumstances which would exclude the finding of liability for a disease (usually a psychological or ‘stress’ disease). The amendment did this by replacing the previously narrowly interpreted ‘disciplinary action’ exclusion clause to one of ‘reasonable administrative action taken in a reasonable manner’.</para>
<para>The SRCOLA Act amendment also added a non-exclusive list of ‘administrative actions’. This list also incorporated and broadened the previous items which excluded liability due to an employee’s ‘failure to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit’.</para>
<para>Attachment B provides the relevant excerpts of the SRC Act.</para>

<para>(1)   (a)   I am advised that AFMA is developing a quota management policy as part of a broader regulatory reform and simplification project.  The quota management policy will set-out management arrangements that are consistent with legislative and policy objectives.  The policy will consider all aspects of quota management including how to manage incidental catches above fisher entitlements and wasteful discarding of quota species.  Implementing changes to AFMA’s quota management arrangements may require some fishers to change their fishing practices.  To assist AFMA in both understanding these impacts and to develop a draft policy, AFMA is collaborating with a panel comprising members of the Commonwealth Fisheries Association.  A draft policy will be released for public consultation by December 2010.</para>

<para>AFMA has introduced an online licensing system. The system is designed to reduce management costs and provide a more timely and accessible service for fishers.  Along with other functions, the system streamlines procedures and processes for monitoring catch against quota; this includes the development of various quota reports.  AFMA procedures for producing catch against quota reports and undertaking all other licensing functions are guided by standard operating procedures (SOPs) implemented earlier this year.  The SOPs ensure that AFMA completes licensing requests from fishers in the same way and to the same standard.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is responsible for the regulation of spectrum. I have received the following advice from ACMA in relation to the question:</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The ACMA review of the 403-520 MHz band (including the UHF Citizen Band) has been ongoing since April 2008. Consultation on this review has been extensive and has involved the publication of website material, the release of three discussion papers (made available on the ACMA website – www.acma.gov.au – and also emailed to known interested parties), media releases, conference and meeting attendances and the use of twitter and Facebook. Additionally, licensees have been advised via a letter sent around June/July 2010 and also via a note attached to their licences, which are renewed annually, that the band is under review.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">
<inline font-weight="bold">Formal Discussion Papers</inline>
</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On 18 April 2008 the ACMA released the discussion paper, Spectrum Options 403–520 MHz: Initial consultation on future arrangements for the 400 MHz band (the Options Paper). This was the first formal step in a review of spectrum management arrangements in the 400 MHz band. The purpose of that discussion paper was to stimulate discussion and gather information from stakeholders to assist the ACMA to develop future arrangements for the 400 MHz band. A media release accompanied the publication of the paper.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Seventy five responses were received to the Options Paper, with several comments on UHF CB issues.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Subsequent analysis of the responses and additional work carried out by the ACMA resulted in the development of the refined options and proposals set out in the Spectrum Proposals: 403-520 MHz - Proposals for future arrangements in the 400 MHz band (the Proposals Paper) released on 2 April 2009. This paper was also sent via email to respondents to the previous paper and to other known interested parties. A media release also accompanied the publication of the paper. Sixty-one responses were received by the ACMA to the Proposals paper again including responses from the UHF CB community. The ACMA also updated its website material on the 400 MHz review and released a summary of the responses received to the Proposals paper to provide stakeholders with a broad insight into the submissions received.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Key outcomes of the review were released on 30 April 2010 in the ACMA paper The Way Ahead – Decisions and Implementation Options for the 400 MHz Band.

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Additionally, updates on the progress of the review have been provided to the ACMA’s Radiocommunications Consultative Committee (RCC). A working group of the RCC was formed to consider issues associated with the review of the 400 MHz band. This group has met four times (details below) and consists of members representing a range of users in the 400 MHz band – a member of this group represents the interests of UHF CB users.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The ACMA has also consulted with Citizen Band equipment manufacturers and individual CB users during the review process.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The ACMA has also held a series of “tune-ups” on the 400 MHz review in July/August 2010, visiting all capital cities and Townsville. Changes to the UHF CB arrangements were discussed at these events.</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(2)">
<para>The ACMA has decided to allocate further channels in the UHF Citizen band by reducing existing channel bandwidth because additional spectrum is not available for the UHF Citizen Band service to expand into if the current channel bandwidth arrangements were maintained. Therefore the only option available to increase the number of channels is to add new channels in the spectrum opened up by reducing the existing channel bandwidth. This mirrors the approach used throughout the broader 400 MHz band.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The ACMA analysed trends in use of the 400 MHz band, surveyed international trends in use, conducted a survey of frequency assigners and employed a consultant to engage with CB equipment manufacturers and CB users on the proposed changes to arrangements. Feedback from frequency assigners was that it had become difficult to find frequencies in the 400 MHz band in high and medium density areas to assign new services. The consultant examining use of the UHF Citizen Band found that in high and medium density areas the demand for UHF CB repeater licences is constrained by the current arrangements and that many new applications were not able to be accommodated. Demand in rural and remote areas was not constrained. The demand for UHF CB repeaters arises from pastoral and mining industries, Shire Councils, Aboriginal Communities and Emergency Services.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>An organised regime of spectrum monitoring was not used to quantify use of the UHF Citizen Band. The ACMA has conducted monitoring in other areas of the 400 MHz band and the results of that work show that monitoring of use does not correlate well with licence availability.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The ACMA has received sporadic complaints about congestion in the UHF Citizen Band over the years: precise information on how many is not available as this feedback takes on many forms and is received by a number of areas of the ACMA. It should be noted that the review of the UHF Citizen Band was largely driven by a desire to increase the utility of the band by offering additional channels and not solely by a need to relieve congestion. Feedback on the proposal to increase the number of channels has been overwhelmingly positive.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The UHF Citizen Band is part of the 400 MHz band – when considering changes to the 400 MHz band to increase its utility the ACMA concluded that similar measures should be applied to the UHF Citizen Band.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>The ACMA believes that the costs to users will be minimal or zero in many cases as the timeframes given to transition to the new arrangements align with the typical lifecycle of equipment. The ACMA also believes that the overall benefits offered by the new arrangements will be attractive to UHF CB users, leading to a desire to upgrade equipment. The ACMA has also discussed with equipment manufacturers the possibility of upgrading existing UHF CB equipment to render it compatible with the new arrangements. They have responded positively to this and have indicated that this service may be offered on some equipment models.</para>

<para>(a) Misuse of the emergency channels in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney varies sporadically from hour to hour and hence it is difficult to quantify. The principal issue the ACMA receives complaints about with regard to the emergency channels 5 and 35 is that operators using channel 35 unknowingly trigger a repeater on channel 5. When issues of misuse are reported to the ACMA the channels are monitored to determine whether the issue is still ongoing. If it is, the user is located and advice on the correct use of the channel is provided. Once found and advised users generally move to a more appropriate channel.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The level of interference to emergency channels 5 and 35 is expected to diminish as additional repeater channels become available for use.

</item>
<item label="(d)">
<para>In the last 12 months, the ACMA has received 3 complaints (2 Newcastle, 1 Rockhampton) about interference on UHF channels 5 and 35 that contained sufficient information to commence a field investigation.</para>
<para>However in 2008 the ACMA dealt with a number of complaints, mainly from one individual, concerning interference to UHF channels 5 and 35 in the Brisbane area.</para>
</item>
<item label="(e)">
<para>The ACMA website provides information about licensing the operation on the citizen band. The ACMA FACT Sheet ‘Citizen band radio’, includes specific information about the use of UHF emergency channels 5 and 35. However, the ACMA’s response to interference to the emergency channels is largely complaint driven and tailored to the individual circumstances of the complaint. Responses include making educational announcements over the air through to the use of direction finding equipment to identify stations causing the interference. As a first step, individuals that are identified as causing interference are provided with advice about appropriate operation.</para>
<para>In respect to the Brisbane problems referred to in part (d) above, the interference on UHF channels 5 and 35 was caused by many different individuals associated with major construction activities. In this case the ACMA resolved the situation through discussions with the prime contractors.</para>

<para>The relevant UHF CB equipment standard is being updated to provide for changes in equipment specifications and performance.

<para>(a) The World Radio Conference to be held in 2012 is expected to consider the introduction of addition channels in the VHF Maritime Mobile band. Australia through the ACMA and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority participate in these processes.</para>
<para>The allocation of additional channels is expected to alleviate inappropriate use of emergency channels 16 and 67. The ACMA is separately investigating reported congestion and misuse of VHF Maritime Mobile channels in Australian waters. One potential outcome of this investigation is the allocation of additional channels for use by the recreational maritime community.</para>

<para>The ACMA commenced a review of operator qualification arrangements for VHF radio use on recreational marine vessels with the release of a public discussion paper in September 2009. Earlier advice from the National Marine Safety Committee (NMSC) indicated that there were concerns about declining standards in the operation of marine VHF radio and low compliance with operator certification. NMSC survey data suggests the level of certification to be around 50%. The ACMA understands the compliance level is significantly lower than this. The review is nearing completion and the ACMA is considering options to best support its spectrum management objectives and to increase VHF radio users’ awareness of correct channel usage and radio protocols. This review is planned to be completed by the end of 2010.</para>
