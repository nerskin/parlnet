As per this legislation, after the authority proposes that a particular adjustment is made, it then goes to the minister and then of course it is a disallowable instrument. That modelling must be done so that the parliament understands and can make sure that the authority has all of the information at hand about the impact that that adjustment would have.</span>

This amendment would be about ensuring that, once there is an adjustment made, that information is available—that the authority is not making the proposal in a vacuum, as some would argue has been the case.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that we know what the environmental impacts of any adjustment are going to be. It is not good enough for the authority to say that they have done the modelling and have looked at it themselves and for them to keep the information to themselves. It must be available to the public. It must be available to the communities that that adjustment may or may not affect. The parliament must have access to it in order to make a decision about whether they accept or deny the minister's recommendation if an adjustment is to be tabled in this place.</span>

This is a requirement of the bill. The detail on how the assessment will occur is appropriately left to the Basin Plan. Based on the most recent draft of the Basin Plan and subsequent suggestions that have been made to the authority, the final plan is expected to set out details of the assessment methodology, including modelling requirements. In addition, the authority will have to include in its notice, which is tabled under 23B(2)(e) and 23B(3)(c), an outline of the materials on which it based its decision in determining that the criteria in the Basin Plan are met.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is in relation to the adjustment ability within this legislation. As we know, in the bill as it currently stands there is an ability to adjust down, or reduce, the amount of water to be returned to the river and back to the environment or to increase it, but only to five per cent. This amendment would put a floor on the amount of water that the plan sets as the appropriate level of the minimum of water to be returned to the river. This amendment will remove the ability to regulate down and to reduce the level of water to be returned to the river—after, of course, the plan has been approved by the parliament. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would also remove the cap on the level of achievement, because, as we know, this is a plan that is meant to stretch 20 years. This plan takes us out until 2030. With a drying climate, the impact of climate change with less run-off in the system, and changes to various parts of the Murray-Darling Basin in terms of the climate, it may be that we find that those targets or outcomes that we have set out to achieve in terms of restoring various environmental icon sites—how we manage the system—may need more water than the minimum that the plan has set. It may be that we need more than that extra five per cent, so we should not be putting a cap and limiting our level of achievement. Of course it still has to come back to parliament. There has to be the modelling to prove it and it has to go through all of that process, but why would we want to lock in a ceiling that limits our achievement for the next 20 years? </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of South Australia, we know that the plan that is on the table is not enough to get us through the next drought. It is not enough to save our citrus growers in the Riverland. It is not enough to ensure that the dairy farmers throughout the bottom end of the system have water of a quality that is okay to feed their stock. We know that it is not enough in the drier years to keep the Murray mouth open. Why would we want to lock in failure?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment takes away that limit and ensures that, regardless of who the next government may or may not be or the government after that or the government after that or the government after that, you cannot just reduce the amount of water being returned to the river. Under the current legislation, if the plan is put to the parliament next week by the minister at a base level of 2,750 gigalitres, this would allow the amount of water to be returned by 2019 to the river system of only 2,100 gigalitres. That is half of what the best available science says is needed. That is death to the Coorong. That is a nail in the coffin to the lower stretches of the river and it does not give communities certainty throughout the basin that they will have a healthy, living river in years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless we amend this part of the legislation, the only amount of water that will be guaranteed to be returned back to the environment  is 2,100 gigalitres. That is not enough to save the system. That will condemn the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. It will not flush out the two million tonnes of salt each year that we need to flush through the system to keep the water quality healthy. It will not provide water certainty for the communities that rely on it. Over the next 20 years, we need to adapt to the climate as the climate changes—that is what this amendment is about—and ensuring that we do not limit our ability to look after the environment, look after the communities and not allow the amount of water to be returned to the river to be cut in half.</span>

That is already part of the structure. If there is environmental neutrality and you want to help citrus growers or stock and domestic water suppliers as stated by Senator Hanson-Young then why should those people not have the capacity to utilise that water for irrigation? It is not saying that it is going to happen but in fact it is weighted more towards the environment—vastly more towards the environment—because you can only go down if there is environmental neutrality. One of the issues we have is that you can go up without economic and social neutrality.</span>

Maybe Senator Joyce was not paying attention last night but, if he was, he would remember that those targets are not in here. There is no benchmark, so South Australia has absolutely no guarantee that the next government could not come in here and legislate downwards the amount of water to be returned to the system. Tough luck for South Australia. Tough luck for the Coorong. Tough luck for the Lower Lakes. Tough luck for the Riverland. Tough luck for other communities throughout the basin who do not have in this legislation a guarantee of what those environmental targets are going to be. Senator Joyce can talk as much as he likes about the fact that the water will not be reduced, unless those environmental achievements and targets are met, except that he voted not to put them in the legislation, so it actually means nothing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have only put up one amendment, and it goes to the nub of the issue, which is the utmost concern for the 2.2 million people who live in the basin. In respect and in balance to an environmental outcome, we need the triple bottom line to be enshrined in the legislation and definitive. It is vitally important that we recognise that if this goes wrong we do have the capacity as it currently stands to destroy towns, to take away their economic lifeblood so that they collapse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my opening speech, the picture we have in our minds is not even so much of the irrigators; it is of the people who live in a house on a street and who are looking to us to make sure that their economic base is protected. They do not get compensated if this goes wrong. These are people who have paid off their houses, who have done the diligent thing, who have done what the Australian public have asked and moved west to be a mechanic or a schoolteacher or a labourer; they have built their life up in one of these regional towns—and there are 2.2 million of these people. We must make sure that their economic and social fabric is maintained and that we do not devastate their lives, because they have as much right as the environment. I think that the purpose of this parliament is primarily to protect the rights of people, and these people certainly have rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a definitive statement of trying to make sure that, in any move you make, you must look at the social and economic outcomes of removing water from that district. There must not be an apparent social detriment. We always know there could be some form of detriment, but it must not be so apparent that it becomes quite obvious that you have affected the social and economic future of that town—whether it is Collarenebri or St George, Berry or Mildura. These people have done what our nation has asked of them and, therefore, we must respect that by dealing with the aspects that are pertinent to the river. We have proved our credentials there by, under the last days of the Howard government, putting $10 billion on the table to try and remedy the environmental outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to maintain the respect of the Australian people, we must make sure we protect them from unreasonable social and economic detriment. What this basically says is that we have all these clauses in there about environmental neutrality, about protecting the environment. We have stated over and over again, ad nauseam, about the worth and benefit of the environment. The Australian people, particularly those 2.2 million who live in the basin, are worthy of at least one amendment that definitively spells out their rights, that they are not going to be the casualties of any actions by this government, or a future government, and that they can rely on one clause that says, 'You can’t do that to our town because it is protected within the legislation—it is outside the law—therefore, you must not do it.'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  The Greens will not be supporting this amendment. There are no details, no criteria, in this. Who is to decide what is detrimental? Where is the detail of how that will be measured? It is not on the table. Senator Joyce has not given that to us at all. He wants us to pass this amendment with no details, no criteria, no nothing while at the same time voting down a very detailed amendment that does set some criteria, at least for the environmental outcomes. I would have been more than happy to have talked about how we determine and measure the detrimental socioeconomic indicators but they are just not there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to point out one thing in relation to buybacks. We hear rumours that even within the coalition parties there are splits and people will cross the floor because they do not know what impacts the buybacks will have. There is a myth being peddled, particularly by the Nationals but by the coalition broadly, in relation to the impacts that buybacks are having. We know, at least from the public purse perspective, that buybacks are the most efficient way of returning water to the river. Let's remember why we are doing this because more water has been allocated throughout the system than the river can sustain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian taxpayer is going through this process of buying back water that should never have been given away in the first place. South Australia uses seven per cent of the entire water in the basin yet we are spending $11 billion to claw back some of the water—just some of the water—that might get us somewhere near to returning the river to health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that buybacks are four to five times cheaper in terms of their return rate of water. This is public money. I find it astonishing that the coalition does not seem to give two hoots about spending $11 billion on a plan that is not even going to achieve the outcomes. Why is that? Chair, I put to you that perhaps because most of the $11 billion will go to friends of Barnaby Joyce. Friends of Barnaby Joyce will get the $11 billion of money.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Joyce is going to make a lot of people in the upstream states very, very happy. Eleven billion dollars will be bankrolled out to big irrigators for buying back water that they greedily took when they should not have had access to it in the first place—$11 billion of Australian taxpayers' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at some of the reaction from those irrigators who have participated in the buyback programs in the past. There was a survey and report done by the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities in relation to sellers of water entitlements, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Restoring the Balance in the Murray-Darling Basin Program. </span>Some of the responses of people who have already participated in water buybacks under that program were: 80 per cent of irrigators surveyed said the decision to sell water had been positive for them, including 30 per cent who said the decision had been 'very positive'. This is not doomsday, as the coalition would like to make out. Most of the 158 irrigators who sold their water and exited farming are now working in other employment in that same region—51 per cent are still working in the region—and 35 per cent have retired in that region, so they are still contributing the money they got to that local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Half of the irrigators who sold part of their water entitlement continued farming. So, after selling their water, they are able to continue farming, and they have said it has had no consequences for farm production. Around 30 per cent of irrigators surveyed who had sold all their water on entitlement and continued on the farm said that selling had had no impact on their ability to continue production. Around half of all irrigators who sold water to the Commonwealth did so because they believed they received a higher price for that than they would get selling their water on the market. It is a pretty good deal. It is also the best bang for the buck for the Australian taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does not give a damn about spending $11 billion and not even getting the environmental outcomes that this plan is meant to achieve. What happens in five years when we are back in drought? We have already spent $11 billion not returning enough water to the river.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What then? When the impacts of climate change start biting in the southern basin and the water quality north of Adelaide is too salty to feed stock, let alone use domestically—what then? How are we going to get back the water that we need when we have just spent $11 billion not returning enough water but bankrolling Senator Joyce's mates?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  Well, where does one start? It is a wonderful day: I have just been informed that I have lots of friends—that is a turn up for the books—and I have just found out that I have $11 billion—that is also a new experience! I have to admit that, as perverse as it is, sometimes when people from the Australian Greens get stuck into me it is advertising—very good advertising. So I would like to thank Senator Hanson-Young for her exemplary promotion of the work that I do. But it was an absolutely absurd statement that we have just heard. It was also completely convoluted and confused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How on earth can you say that we are talking about a process that would actually limit buybacks? They would have to pass a socioeconomic test of neutrality or, better than that, no detriment. Because there is no detriment, even if I did have these multibillionaire big irrigation mates—and this is like Disneyland—they would not be able to do that with this amendment that I have moved. They would not be able to do it because it would bring detriment to the community and therefore it would not be allowed. So the whole purpose of this is completely at odds with the dissertation that we have just received from Senator Hanson-Young.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also find it amazing that, all of a sudden, the Greens have been endowed with financial purity. Where they become financially prudent is when they decide that the frogs are more important than the people. Then, they become pure. When it is actually people who are going to be hurt then they are financial purists. The whole purpose of this from the start was that $5.8 billion was to go to infrastructure because we did not want to destroy communities. But the Greens, by Senator Hanson-Young's own advocacy now, have said, 'No, forget about the people. They don't matter. It is all about the newts, the frogs and the swamps. Let's forget about the people and what this is about.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a parliament that is supposed to represent, first and foremost, people—the rights of the Australian people and the future of those towns. But the Greens do not care about that. Today, Senator Hanson-Young has become an economic rationalist—an economic rationalist at the expense of the rights of the people who live in the basin. This is not an amendment for irrigators. This is an amendment for the people who live in the brick and tiles in the streets of the town of Mildura, who live in the weatherboard and iron of Dirranbandi, who live in the houses of Berri and who live in the irrigation towns up and down the basin. This is their amendment, not the irrigators' amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the amendment for the vast majority of the people who actually have no right to any compensation, who are never going to be compensated. It is an amendment that talks about social justice, which I thought the Greens, once upon a time, believed in. We now see that their social justice mantra is a ploy that is wheeled out from time to time for purposes that they determine fit. It is not a genuine outcome. I am not surprised in the least by the Australian Greens' position on this. I am disappointed, but surprise at the hypocrisy from the Greens is something that, in this place, we have grown awfully accustomed to.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Hell has truly frozen over in this place this morning, because we just received a lecture on economic and fiscal responsibility from the Australian Greens! The Australian Greens—the big taxing, big spending party of this parliament, who put even the Labor Party to shame with their spending habits—have just attempted to give the parliament a lecture on economic and fiscal responsibility. As I recover from the shock of hearing Senator Hanson-Young try to lecture us on how to return water in the most fiscally responsible way and for the least cost, I think it is important that we put some context to the issues around buybacks, the issues around the buyback versus infrastructure debate and, of course, the amendment that is related to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night and this morning we have heard, frankly, plenty of sanctimonious BS coming from that corner of the chamber—plenty of it. I am tired of hearing it. They are pretending that they are the only ones who care about getting a result for the Murray. Occasionally they drag the communities of the Murray into this debate somehow and pretend they are also standing up for all of those irrigator communities as well as the Lower Lakes communities. That is just not true. The Greens seem to be obsessed by headlines about what the number is that is going to be achieved. It is not about the number; it is about the outcome. And the outcome is about ensuring that we get an environmentally sustainable plan, but a plan that is delivered in a way that leaves us with sustainable communities as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an earlier amendment, Senator Hanson-Young had the gall to pretend that she wanted and was arguing for even greater water cuts so as to protect Riverland citrus growers. Well, hello? If you have greater cuts, there is going to be less water available for those Riverland citrus growers to use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson-Young just does not seem to appreciate the fact that every drop we put back into the environmental flows has to come from somewhere, and that it comes off the productive capacity. We took the bold step in government of saying: 'Yes, we acknowledge the system has been overallocated'—and I am going to turn to whose fault it is that it was overallocated in a second because I think you totally misunderstand whose fault that is—'and we've got to return water to the environment. We want to get the system back to a level of sustainability, but we want to do so in a way that preserves and protects the fabric of the communities up and down the river system.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If infrastructure projects and environmental works and measures can be undertaken, and if they can deliver the water necessary for sustainability, why are they better and preferable to buybacks? They are preferable because they ensure we keep farmers on farms along the river with productive capacity, growing food for this country's future. There seems to be a misconception, and it is often spread around, that farmers and irrigators are to blame for overallocation. It is certainly not the farmers or the irrigators and it is most definitely not the communities they live in. Those who are to blame for overallocation are state governments. Let's lay the blame firmly where it sits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we could manage to get the state governments to foot the bill for all of the adjustment costs, I would be very happy—and no doubt Senator Ludwig, Senator Conroy and Mr Burke would all be delighted. But, of course, the state governments will not meet the bill for the costs of adjustment. The state governments issued the licences and farmers went out to those communities and set up. Taking advantage of those licences, communities were built around them and now 2.1 million people, I think, live in basin communities, and rely, in large part, upon irrigation activities to sustain the social fabric and the economic basis of those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a devil of a problem when you boil it all down, because you are trying to get water back—water that underpins the economic base of those communities without destroying that economic base. That is why the Howard government prioritised spending on infrastructure. It is why Senator Joyce, Senator McKenzie, I and others have been so critical of the government for not fulfilling those expectations and delivering the priority when it comes to infrastructure spending. We welcome the fact that the government seems to have rediscovered that as a priority. It will allow us to achieve the objective that we all want, that I know deep down you want, Senator Hanson-Young, and that I certainly want which is to get sustainability into the river system. That will ensure that those whom I spoke about yesterday, those Lake Albert farmers and irrigators on the Lower Lakes, have water that they can use to irrigate. That is what I think would be a good and equitable outcome: that they should be able to pump water that is of a quality and a standard for them to irrigate. But, as I said yesterday, it is not the volume of water in that case that matters because there has been more than enough water flowing through the Lower Lakes in the last three years.</span>

There is an environmentalist on the authority. There is a respected former public servant running the authority. There has been more than $100 million spent on research and on consultation to get to this point and they are now saying, 'We're going to return at a starting point 2,750 billion litres of water into the system' and the government is now committing to try to get a further 450 billion litres of water on top of that.

I have no doubt that there will be concerns with aspects of the water recovery strategy. I have no doubt that there are some issues throughout this. We are on the cusp of taking a big step forward, but Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens just seem intent on tearing down and destroying what should be a good step forward in the management of the Murray and what should be acclaimed in South Australia. If we can get this plan in place and if we can get an outcome that protects the Riverland communities of South Australia just as much as it protects the communities upstream, we should be hailing that as a good result.</span>

They want to protect their communities just as much as you or I, Senator Hanson-Young, or Senator McEwen, or any other South Australian, want to protect our communities. We need to find a way that ensures that they feel that there is protection for their communities whilst giving the win for our communities that we want and need.</span>

Nobody believes the Greens when they talk about fiscal responsibility. Understand that there is a very good reason that governments of both persuasions now—us, when we were in government; the other mob now that they have worked this out—support and prioritise infrastructure outcomes because they can give the win-win result that gets us the water we want for a healthy river and does so in a way that actually leaves the socioeconomic fabric of this community intact.</span>

The government expects that, in line with the minister's suggestions of 1 November, the issue of social and economic neutrality will be dealt with in the Basin Plan.

Throughout our inquiry and this whole debate there has been a complex and contested understanding of what a healthy river looks like and means in actuality. I could not agree more with Senator Birmingham's debating points around getting the outcome right rather than getting fixated and obsessed with a particular number, particularly when we look at science and technology's capacity to assist us to use water more efficiently and therefore ensure a more sustainable outcome for the river itself. Could you outline the best way to measure the environmental health of the Murray-Darling Basin system?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator NASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  I rise today to make some remarks regarding the Higher Education Support Amendment (Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The coalition will not be opposing this bill. We are certainly very supportive of legislation that streamlines, that makes things easier and more efficient, and that indeed is the case with this particular piece of legislation. The Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 will amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The bill aims to strengthen and streamline the administration of the government's higher education loan schemes—HELP schemes—FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. VET FEE-HELP was announced by the Howard government in the 2007 budget and it extended FEE-HELP to the vocational training and education sector. This move by the coalition recognised there was a need to encourage students to take up higher level skill qualification by reducing financial barriers and it addressed the unfair situation where the VET sector had courses with high fees, but was the only sector with postsecondary qualifications without an income-contingent loans scheme. VET FEE-HELP plays an important role in ensuring Australians have access to affordable education. VET FEE-HELP is a government loans scheme which helps eligible students pay their tuition fees for higher level vocational education and training courses—VET courses undertaken at approved VET FEE-HELP providers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is useful to make a few comments about how it works for those that do not necessarily have an understanding in this area. To be an approved provider, registered training organisations—or RTOs—must apply to the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education and satisfy a range of eligibility requirements. RTOs must:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">VET FEE-HELP can be used to cover all or part of a student's tuition fees. The government pays the loan amount directly to the approved provider. Students repay the loan gradually through the tax system once their income reaches the compulsory repayment threshold set by the ATO. The threshold is currently $49,095. VET FEE-HELP is available for courses at approved providers at the level of diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma. The amendment bill before the chamber came about because of a post-implementation review of VET FEE-HELP undertaken in 2011. The review was commissioned in 2009 and found that VET FEE-HELP was administratively complex and, as I said at the outset, the coalition is supportive of those measures that will reduce complexity when it comes to administration. The review also found that overall there is strong support for the scheme by the VET sector, particularly in relation to the scheme's role in providing greater equity and accessibility for VET students. The review did however find that the scheme was increasing at a slower than anticipated rate in terms of student enrolment and approved VET FEE-HELP providers, but there were positive signs for further growth. The bill is the first stage of implementation of those changes made in the post-implementation review. We certainly welcome the practical measures in the bill which reduce red tape and that aim to increase the number of VET FEE-HELP providers and, in turn, students accessing vocational education courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to point out the importance of VET courses. Over many years we have seen a lot of focus on the higher education system when it comes to university. It is pleasing to see, increasingly over recent years, the focus that has been placed on the VET sector and the important role that it provides our students, particularly those in regional areas. It is also very pleasing to see a number of collaborative arrangements starting to take place—indeed, they have been for some time—between the university sector and the TAFE sector. I am very supportive of those arrangements, where they are in place, and know that there is a real benefit in there, particularly for regional students. We welcome any attempt to increase the access of students to further education, both VET and tertiary, although I must note that over recent years it has not always been the case that this government has put in place measures that have done so. I refer to the changes in early 2010, changing the arrangements for the independent youth allowance, which severely disadvantaged some regional students, and was very pleased to see after a lengthy period of time that the government did do a backflip, recognising the inequity that they had created for regional students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vitally important that our regional students have equity of access to education. There is no excuse for regional students to have anything less than that equity when it comes to accessing education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RIS completed by the government states that the take-up of VET FEE-HELP by RTOs, and therefore students, has been below government expectations. However, I note that there are positive signs with data showing that the number of students accessing VET FEE-HELP is increasing over time. A total of 39,124 students accessed VET FEE-HELP during 2011. That is a 50 per cent increase in the number accessing assistance in 2010 and an increase of more than 600 per cent since VET FEE-HELP was first made available. The increase in the number of students accessing VET FEE-HELP assistance corresponds to an increase in the number of VET providers offering VET FEE-HELP and also the number of students eligible for VET FEE-HELP assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of particular concern to me is the low take-up rate of VET FEE-HELP by students in regional and remote areas. This is referred to as an issue of concern in the RIS. In 2011, 18.2 per cent of students accessing VET FEE-HELP were from regional and remote Australia. Clearly, that is a figure that we would like to see improved. The complex administrative policies and processes of VET FEE-HELP are noted as major contributing factors to the low participation rate of this group. It is, however, slightly promising to see that the percentage is increasing. The figure of 18.2 per cent is an increase of about 86 per cent from 2010. So, while the figure is still unacceptably low, we note that it is increasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that the participation figure for regional and remote students continues to increase. World-class education is the right of every Australian and a vital investment in the people, opportunities and prosperity of our nation, regardless of where you live. However, we know that where you live does have a big impact on the ability to access both VET and tertiary education. An increase in the number of RTOs in regional locations would help to increase participation by regional and remote students. According to VET FEE-HELP data collection in 2011, there were 230 campuses of approved VET providers. We note that some providers operate at multiple campuses. None were located in remote or very remote regions. In New South Wales, for example, there are 74 campuses of approved VET providers: 57 are in major cities, 15 are in inner regional areas and only two are in outer regional areas. In Queensland, there are 31 in major cities, one in an inner regional area and one in an outer regional area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The estimated cost for a regional student to relocate and attend university is said to exceed $30,000 per year in study costs, accommodation and living expenses. The cost to relocate for VET would be a comparable amount. The cost of relocation is a huge barrier to regional and remote students taking up VET FEE-HELP places. An increase to providers in these areas would surely assist in breaking down these barriers. Again, there is the inequity that exists for our regional students who are faced with the burden of the cost of relocation—a burden that does not sit with our students, by and large, in metropolitan areas. One of the key issues that we on both sides of this chamber must continue to grapple with is to make sure that we have equity of access for our regional students. When I talk to parents in the regions, they say they simply cannot afford it, even in spite of the measures the minister has put in place that he says are assisting regional students. I will give credit where credit is due: in some areas, that is indeed the case. But, by and large, there are still a number of regional families who are not sending their students away to tertiary education because of the cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of the skill shortage facing the agriculture industry, I am also concerned to see the low take-up rate—that is, the proportion of fees deferred through VET FEE-HELP assistance for agricultural, environmental and related studies. Of all the disciplines, agriculture had the lowest take-up rate at 40 per cent. This is in comparison to areas such as food hospitality and personal services, which had the highest take-up rate of 94.3 per cent. Why? This is attributed to the lack of access to education and training in regional and remote areas. These areas also have limited access to the internet and lower rates of broadband use, limiting the option of online study.</span>

                    </a>  Unfortunately, Minister, things just do not happen quickly enough, do they? Minister, if you had not overbeaten the egg, we might be a little closer to having some broadband for those areas. Between 2009 and 2011, the number of VET courses in agricultural, environmental and related studies has increased from 25 to 45, which is welcomed. Anything we can do to encourage and make it easier for more students to enter agricultural training at any level, be it tertiary, VET or short courses, is to be encouraged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate committee report on higher education and skills training in agriculture and agribusiness, released in June, revealed the agriculture industry needs 4,000 graduates a year to fill vacancies, yet there are currently only 700 graduates. This is an issue I continue to implore the government to focus on, in terms of future sustainability of the agriculture sector in Australia When we have figures such as those in front of us, it is simply not good enough that more is not being done to address this issue, increase the participation rate and ensure that our young people understand the very bright future for them in the agriculture sector. Reasons for the decline in agriculture and agribusiness education in Australia are complex, but they include an ageing workforce, competition from the mining industry and the high cost of education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2001, there has been a trend of declining enrolment in higher education qualifications in ag science and related fields, leading to a shortage of qualified professionals in the agriculture sector. This is alarming, particularly in light of the fact that the on-farm agriculture sector is forecast to lose at least 30 per cent of its workforce over the next 10 years, mostly due to ageing. As one of those farmers in regional areas who is ageing, I think I am part of that figure now. It really is something we need to be aware of. We need to ensure that we encourage the next generation to be on the land and be involved in the agriculture sector, given the contribution agriculture makes to the economy, the nation and our society. Studies have shown that educational attainment in agriculture is generally low compared to other industries. However, the gap in attainment is greater for bachelor degrees than for VET qualifications, and for lower level VET qualifications agriculture has a higher proportion than overall, demonstrating a preference for VET training rather than tertiary studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Provision of education through VET training as an alternate pathway to tertiary courses is of increased importance in light of the government's axing of the popular Farm Ready program earlier this year. Courses of a shorter duration have traditionally been popular with farmers and their employees. While short courses may not achieve certificates, diplomas or degrees, they are essential to encourage knowledge sharing and skills in the industry. As we know very well, primary producers are time poor, with many unwilling to commit to extended periods of training. Farm Ready helped to fill a gap in the skills market and was axed despite there being 469 approved courses at the end of May 2012, including computer mapping, introduction to no-till, succession planning, use of computerised financial packages, production change, whole farm planning, management integrated crop and pasture production, pasture and animal production, strategic management and permaculture design.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The VET FEE-HELP scheme has the potential to assist many more Australians to access further education. Moves to remove barriers to participation in the scheme, which will hopefully assist in addressing inequities faced by regional and remote students, are certainly welcomed, and the coalition will not be opposing the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  The Greens support some aspects of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2012 which take a risk-managed approach to administrative compliance. We do however have concerns about the VET FEE-HELP scheme, which we outlined in additional comments made to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations' review of this legislation. The Greens do not support the proposed government amendments that will delay the indexation of Student Start-up Scholarships, which are awarded to students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to assist them with the start-up costs of commencing full-time tertiary study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the Greens support the provisions of this bill that allow a risk-managed approach to approvals and administrative compliance. It makes sense that the low risk posed by institutions, such as publicly funded TAFEs and universities, is recognised when the minister is approving their applications as a VET provider. After all, our public education institutions are effectively underwritten by government and subject to public scrutiny via their public funding in a way that private corporations are not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The requirement that the minister must regard a wider range of financial information when making a decision about an applicant's financial viability is appropriate, especially when we remember the number of dubious private providers going bust in 2009, leaving students in the lurch and leaving the government to pick up the financial pieces. We also remember the damage it did to our international reputation. The seeking of full information from TEQSA or a relevant VET regulator when approving, revoking or suspending a higher education or VET provider's eligibility around VET FEE-HELP and FEE-HELP is also a due process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More timely revocation of a higher education or VET provider's approval as a VET provider when they have been found to present a financial risk or do not meet quality standards or other responsibilities is clearly needed. Students need protection from such providers. The time between the minister's decision to revoke such approval and the time that revocation takes effect must be minimal so that students are not duped into enrolling with institutions that are about to lose their licence to provide VET courses. We cannot risk public money following such enrolments disappearing along with the institution itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegating to non-public servants to ensure the business of all departments administering funding or programs under the act will continue, despite changes in government or administrative arrangement orders. We can see that this is sensible. The consolidating of four existing sets of guidelines—the VET provider, the VET FEE-HELP, the VET tuition fee and the VET administration guidelines—into one set of VET guidelines also makes sense. The Greens note the concerns raised by a number of providers that much of the detail will be effected through the VET guidelines. This means those details have not been available for examination or assessment, and we do support the call for the government to continue to consult with stakeholders in formulating the VET guidelines provided for in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill allows the minister's power to expand the VET courses applicable for VET FEE-HELP to include certificate IV courses and above. This is in schedule 1, and this change is very troubling. We note the concerns raised by TAFE Directors Australia and RMIT University that VET students currently do not have equitable access to FEE-HELP loans. The Greens agree with the National Tertiary Education Union that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is an abrogation of the Government's responsibilities to rely on the provision of [income-contingent loans] as the primary policy instrument for improving education participation amongst underrepresented groups of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NTEU have set out very clearly the problems here. The Greens do not support the shifting of costs for vocational education and training onto the student via TAFE student fees. This in turn necessitates students raising debts to participate in VET through the VET FEE-HELP system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">TAFE is an important entry point into further education and training or into employment for a large proportion of students from low socioeconomic regional and rural regions outside capital cities. Indeed, up to nine per cent of students entering university come from vocational and educational training pathways. This is a huge contribution and it clearly needs to be fostered. With large numbers of disadvantaged students traditionally accessing TAFE, it is wrong that those students should be burdened with HELP debts before even entering the workforce—or before even embarking on basic university study. What type of substantial HELP debts do such students accumulate by the end of their basic university degree? That still is not fully clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2011 the Prime Minister spoke about an approaching shortage of about 36,000 tradespeople by 2015. We so often hear talk about this problem and the need for Australia to be able to bring forward more skills training so that we can be the 'innovative nation'—which is put in so many policies these days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government states that it recognises an increase in higher qualifications for disadvantaged Australians is imperative if we are to successfully compete in a future global economy. If we are to succeed in having 20 per cent of undergraduate students coming from low-socioeconomic backgrounds to meet the looming skill shortages, we should not be burdening disadvantaged students with a HELP debt that is needed to pay rising TAFE fees. This is an anathema to any notion of equity or the idea of removing barriers to participation in further education and training, and it could obviously be somewhat of a roadblock to achieving that skilled nation that we all say we are committed to. For this reason, any extension of the VET FEE-HELP scheme is noted with concern as moving in the wrong direction by pre-empting even higher student fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that a fee-and-charges-free TAFE system should be pursued. We need to prioritise and increase VET funding to the TAFE system to ensure a high quality, accessible and viable public VET system.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Higher education is the means by which millions of Australians improve their opportunities. By training for a qualification they gain the means to engage in the labour market and to be active and productive to the fullest extent. The broader economy also gains extra capacity to grow in an increasingly competitive global economy, bringing benefits to the whole community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to remind the Senate of the comments made earlier this year by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Skills determine access to jobs and can transform lives. Too many Australians are locked out of the workforce because they do not have the skills they need. Inaction is not an option. Failure to address this shortfall will leave the economy short of the skills it needs to be successful well into the 21st century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not agree more. Skills Australia has estimated that, in the five years to 2015, Australia will need an additional 2.1 million people in the workforce with higher vocational education and training, or VET, qualifications. Currently it is expected that there will be a shortfall of 500,000 skilled workers. This is particularly relevant for my home state of Tasmania, with Skills Australia research showing that, from now to 2015, Tasmania will need an additional 11,000 people with qualifications at certificate III/IV level and an additional 8,000 people with qualifications at diploma level. The government understands the importance of ensuring that this need is met and that the higher education system is configured correctly to best meet the needs of Australian students, the higher education sector, and the broader Australian economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of higher education is one of particular relevance to Tasmania. Like Australia more broadly, Tasmania faces issues of demography and of a changing global market. With an ageing population, Tasmania faces the issue of a consequently lower workforce participation rate for the foreseeable future. Competition between skilled workers is high, and a lack of skilled workers leads to slower growth and lower productivity. Combined with this, there is anecdotal evidence of a reduction in the number of apprenticeships and traineeships being supported by industry. With slowing demand for Tasmanian products, it is vital that we support individuals to adapt to changing employment opportunities through their working life, as well as supporting individuals to develop new markets. Tasmania must work smarter rather than harder, and an increase in VET education will help to allow Tasmanians to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will introduce a number of measures that will strengthen and streamline the Higher Education Support Act 2003, resulting in more effective and efficient administration of two of the Australian government's Higher Education Loan Program schemes, namely FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. The VET FEE-HELP assistance sc<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">h</span>eme was introduced in 2008 and provides income contingent loans to full-fee-paying and certain subsidised students undertaking eligible VET diplomas, advanced diplomas, graduate certificates and graduate diplomas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of the VET FEE-HELP scheme made it easier for students to access higher education, and the increased participation numbers since the introduction of the scheme are testimony to that. The information collected on the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme and the feedback received as part of the post implementation review of the scheme indicates that there are positive achievements to date and positive signs for continuing growth into the future. These achievements include increasing trends in student enrolments, the number of approved VET FEE-HELP providers, the number of eligible VET courses, participation by students from identified demographic groups and funding to the VET sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review made recommendations to improve the scheme, and this bill will position the government to act on the recommendations arising from the review and its commitments under the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform, particularly the redesign of VET FEE-HELP. The bill enhances the quality and accountability framework underpinning the schemes through strengthening the suspension and revocation provisions. Decisions to revoke or suspend an approved provider will now take effect on the day the notice is registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. The amendments will ensure that notices of revocation will take effect in a more timely manner and will also give the provider greater clarity about the date the revocation will take effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The integrity and transparency of the HELP schemes will also be improved by allowing reports from the national and non-referring jurisdiction education regulators to be considered for both applicants and approved providers. This is expected to result in improved decision making and, in particular, will enhance the capacity to identify low-quality providers. The bill will provide a risk management approach to approvals and compliance for low-risk VET FEE-HELP providers through amendments that allow the minister to determine a category of providers when approving an application. The review noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Student access to VFH loans is largely dependent on the number of RTOs that become approved VFH providers (and the courses that they offer). There is considerable room to encourage greater participation by the VET sector beyond the current 95 approved VFH providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is expected that by taking this approach, the administrative burden placed on low-risk applicants and providers will be reduced and this will encourage increased uptake by quality VET providers and ultimately students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for the consolidation of the following existing four guidelines. They are: VET Provider Guidelines, VET FEE-HELP Guidelines, VET Tuition Fee Guidelines; and VET Administration Guidelines. The consolidated guidelines will simply be called the VET Guidelines. These guidelines are expected to reduce duplication of requirements and improve the accessibility, clarity and transparency of the obligations of approved providers. We know that technology and the needs of employers often change rapidly, so VET providers need flexibility when creating courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes changes regarding the census date for courses. The census date for courses determines the point at which students are deemed to be enrolled in the course for the purposes of FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP. The current provisions are based on the higher education arrangements, whereby the census date is deemed to be not less than 20 per cent of the way through the unit. This is to allow students to withdraw from courses early in their study without incurring a HELP debt. However the PIR noted that, given the flexible nature of VET courses, the 20 per cent rule meant that providers may have multiple census dates resulting in a considerable administrative burden. The inclusion of the census date provisions in the legislation also limits flexibility. This bill removes the current 20 per cent restriction and provides for a census date for each unit of study to be determined in accordance with the Administration Guidelines under FEE-HELP and in accordance with the VET Guidelines under VET FEE-HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also strengthen a number of definitions and other technical amendments to better support VET FEE-HELP. The definition of a VET course of study will be amended in order to provide for a managed trial of certificate IV qualifications as committed under the 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. Lastly, further streamlining of administration to reduce duplication and increase efficiency will be achieved through the consolidation of three sets of legislative guidelines into a single set of guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate referred the bill to the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee, of which I am a member. The committee heard evidence from a number of organisations, including the Tasmanian Department of Education, the National Tertiary Education Union, RMIT University, and TAFE Directors Australia recommending that the bill be passed.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmania is supportive of measures to improve the accessibility of higher level qualifications. We would support measures that would streamline and simplify student access to VET FEE-HELP. In particular, we would support measures that would enable legislation to allow specified Certificate IV level qualifications to be eligible under VET FEE-HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Benefits of introducing VET FEE-HELP in Tasmania for Diploma, Advanced Diploma and specified Certificate IV level qualifications will include allowing us to prioritise government subsidies to the areas of greatest needs such as foundation skills and pathway qualifications in Tasmania's priority industries and occupations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes made in this bill will give students greater choice, and greater access. It will streamline processes for higher education service providers, making the delivery of higher education more cost efficient. By simplifying the administrative aspects of the VET FEE-HELP scheme, we will also see a further increase in the number of training organisations that will offer courses under the scheme. It will help drive the training that we require to meet our current skill shortages and meet our future skill needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Future prosperity is dependent upon increases in productivity. Increasing the skills possessed by Australian workers will help drive increases to productivity and, consequently, an increase in the standard of living for all Australians. Increasing the skills possessed by Australian workers will broaden the opportunities available to those workers and help them to participate in the economy to the fullest extent. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I am pleased to rise to contribute to the debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The bill aims to strengthen and streamline the administration of the Australian government's higher education loan program schemes, FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw attention to the fact that it was under the Howard government in 2007 that VET FEE-HELP was first announced and then FEE-HELP was extended to the vocational education and training sector. The coalition strongly supports, as do all of us in this chamber, any move at all which encourages students to take up higher education skills qualifications. If that reduces their financial barriers then that is to be applauded, and I will speak in some more detail about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of objectives. Firstly, the bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act to achieve the following: strengthen the quality of the loans program schemes themselves, which in itself is laudable; improve information sharing and transparency with national education regulators; improve arrangements for early identification of low-quality providers—hopefully, then to either improve the standard of service of those providers or cause them to exit the market; and, finally, position the government to better manage two areas: the risk to students and public moneys. All of us in this chamber and all those who are listening would always applaud the opportunity—even the obligation of government—to better manage public moneys.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overview of the bill can be briefly described. Schedule 1 aims to increase the take-up of VET FEE-HELP by quality registered organisations and thus by students. This is an area for enormous and tremendous improvement which I hope to come back to. It will allow the minister to specify different approval requirements for those organisations, particularly those that present a low risk to the government and, by inference, a low risk to students and their families who may be supporting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 ensures revocations of approvals are undertaken in a more timely manner and that of itself must be beneficial to everybody in the industry. Schedule 3, a streamlining measure, will act to reduce complexity and duplication through consolidating and streamlining four sets of VET legislative guidelines into a single set, and we would support that. Schedule 4 adjusts the specific date requirements for census dates to the guidelines, so each of those then is a matter of importance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to participation, there are some 5,000 registered training organisations in Australia and they would then be divided into the public sector, principally TAFEs in eastern Australia, and the private sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was stated—at least in 2010—that there were some 2.4 million students participating in skills training at this level, of whom around 75 per cent were under the direction of publicly funded RTOs, and about 600,000, or 25 per cent, in the private sector. Where is the federal government's contribution, given the fact that most of the training in this sector is in fact state and territory funded? In 2010-11 the federal government contributed $1.7 billion to the states and territories, and there has been an allocation of a further $1.75 billion over four years in the current out-year program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, however, a couple of areas that we need to draw attention to. The first is that the two states of Victoria and Western Australia have not yet come into participating. I was part of the committee process that examined the reasons for that last year. I have always been of the view that, had there been perhaps a more prolonged dialogue and a greater degree of flexibility in dealing with Victoria and Western Australia, we may well have seen a circumstance in which all of the states and territories would be participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area to which I will draw your attention is the Australian Skills Quality Authority, ASQA. I point to the fact of the serious underfunding of that organisation. Its role is to both register and to regulate the majority of RTOs. You would think that that in itself is a significant process and challenge given the number that there are—some 5,000. Yet the last figures that I saw said there were only six investigators tasked with ensuring compliance by those RTOs. I think that is an area in which we certainly have some more work to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw attention then to the VET FEE-HELP process. I mentioned earlier the number of students who are participating in the VET sector. In 2011 there were only 39,000 students who had availed themselves of the loan scheme under the VET FEE-HELP program, and that in itself was a doubling from the previous financial year. Even more concerning is that, of the number of RTOs that I have quoted, being some 2,000, in 2011 there were only 112 who were actually registered. Therefore the provision of that facility for students in those programs would necessarily be limited. I will be urging that a lot more attention be given to promoting both the institutions themselves—the RTOs—and students to avail themselves of that loan scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know of course that repayment under the loan scheme only commences when a graduate or recipient of the loan scheme is earning just in excess of $49,000 per year; therefore, it should be a tremendous incentive for people to take up that loan scheme, if indeed it is the barrier to them participating in skills and higher education training. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, there is a 20 per cent loan fee—I would call it an impost—which has been estimated by the government actuary to take account of interest which may accrue through administration and other costs. But, of itself, you would have thought, given the benefit of attaining those skills, having them in the workplace and being able to achieve a higher level of remuneration as a result, that that was a very cheap form of gaining that higher education and skills and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe Senator Nash, in introducing the coalition's side of this debate, would have spoken eloquently because she is a great apologist and defender of rural and regional education. It is the case, as I understand it, that only 18 per cent of those participating in the VET FEE-HELP process are coming from the rural and regional areas of Australia. I would like to reflect for a moment on the very wide gap that exists between urban Australia and rural Australia when it comes to the tertiary education sector and the postsecondary skills sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will compare 1984 with 2009. I refer to tertiary qualifications. In 1984 the urban communities were represented by some 10 per cent of their citizens who had tertiary qualifications. By 2009, that 10 per cent had jumped to 25 per cent—a 250 per cent increase. That is the urban community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to those with tertiary qualifications in the rural, remote and regional areas. While it was 10 per cent in the urban communities in 1984, it was four per cent in the rural and regional areas of Australia. Lamentably, that four per cent from 1984 to 2009 only went up from four per cent to seven per cent, while the wider community had gone up to 25 per cent. That is a figure that we cannot be proud of in this country. In other words, a four per cent to seven per cent increase was a less-than-doubling at a time when the wider community increased by some 250 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now draw your attention to the postsecondary sector, which is more relevant, I admit, to this particular bill. The wider community in 1984 was represented by some 46 per cent with postsecondary qualifications, and that jumped from 46 to 67 per cent in 2009 for the wider community. I now go back to the rural community: that 46 per cent in 1984 for the wider community was less than half, only 27 per cent, in regional communities. That 27 per cent only went up to 42 per cent in that time. That is still a 25 per cent difference between those in the urban and those in the rural and regional communities with postsecondary qualifications. We on this side have spoken many times of the barriers to people getting into the skills and higher education sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, we would all support those moves to ensure that people from low socioeconomic areas have the opportunity to get into skills and higher education training. I make the point again, as indeed was made to me by Professor Alan Robson, then the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australian and the chairman of the national universities sector of Australia, that over time it has been demonstrated that those with the greatest barrier to getting into postsecondary and particularly tertiary education have been those from regional, rural and remote areas of Australia because of that tyranny of distance, that need to have to move from their homes to another location along with all the costs associated with relocation, reestablishment and the maintenance of themselves. In fact, I am one of them. I had to travel from Perth in Western Australia to Brisbane in the 1960s to do a veterinary qualification. Had there not been some limited support at that time through a bonding system with the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, I would not have had that opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the outcome of all of that? It is not the subject necessarily of this program today but we have spoken in the past in this chamber of the very wide gap—the deficiency—between the demand for higher education and skills training, particularly in the agriculture-agribusiness sector in Australia and the actual supply. The figures we quote are those from Dr Jim Pratley from the Australian Council of Deans of Agriculture. I have no reason at all to dispute the figures that he produces, which are that this year alone we will graduate fewer than 700 students in agricultural sciences around Australia when there is a demonstrated need for some 4,000 positions. That is a different challenge, but it has its relationship here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the point because of the recent publicity given by the Prime Minister to <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the Asian Century</span>, talking about these very laudable objectives of Australia becoming the food bowl for Asia. As we all know, we will be feeding 1.9 billion more people in this region alone by 2050. We will do it with less land, less fertiliser, less fuel, fewer pesticides, less water and an ageing population. One of the areas that Australia can expand its provision of services to international students, which at this time is the third-largest income earner for this country, is to make sure that we extend that into education opportunities in rural, regional and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the committee that reviewed the bill before us were in China in July this year. I had the opportunity, along with Senator McKenzie, Senator Bilyk and Senator Marshall, to ask people those very questions: was there a demand in rural and regional areas—in this case in China—for students to be educated and trained? Of course, there was a very strong demand. At this moment we are not addressing ourselves to it. I would have thought that under the auspices of the legislation we are discussing today we would see those opportunities. I am not speaking just about those opportunities in the agriculture and agribusiness areas, I am also speaking about others that affect regional and non-urban communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude with some comments about the appropriateness of education beyond the secondary level. We are at risk in this country of promoting and of focusing on tertiary education when quite rightly for many people we should be focussing on the VET sector—the skill sector. Why do I say that? For numbers of reasons. Having been associated for some years teaching at an agricultural university in Western Australia, I saw many instances of substantial differences or barriers against young people participating in tertiary education, when the right place for them was the postsecondary and VET sector. I speak of gender differences: at the age of 17, young women very often are more mature than young men. Young men are not ready to focus on the discipline and the rigour of a tertiary qualification when at that stage they may well be interested in the more practical nature of VET sector training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Socioeconomics is a factor, and we are addressing it in this bill. Personal circumstances are among other factors. There are students who sometimes cannot be released for full-time study either because of family circumstances or they may be required in their own family's or other businesses on a full-time basis. But they could actually participate part-time, and VET sector training is more appropriate for those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the concerns I have is that there is all too much emphasis on people necessarily having to get a university degree. In fact, it may be far more appropriate for them to make a career for themselves in the trades areas from which they will have obtained qualifications in the VET sector. The other plea we would all make, and I concur with Senator Evans and others in this area, is that unlike the 1970s and eighties and nineties we are seeing now a more seamless movement from those who, for whatever reason, start their postsecondary training in the skills area and then develop an interest in learning. I have seen many instances of young men who have gone into the VET sector, have developed some skills, and then have developed a love of learning. They may have been told when they were kids that they were dumb and thick and could not study, but all of a sudden they have discovered that they love learning. We need to see that seamless movement into the tertiary sector and even into the post-tertiary sector of higher qualifications. I can speak of many instances of young people who we had to fight to get into the VET sector and who subsequently not only got degrees but also went on to get very good doctorates in their areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the areas upon which I want to focus. As I said, I support the thrust of this legislation. I support any opportunity for a young person to be able to take a loan under the HELP provisions, if that is necessary. But it is not adequate to just get somebody into the postsecondary and tertiary sectors, what we need to focus on is them graduating—passing, completing and moving forward. I will give all support to those policies, those philosophies and that legislation which will achieve it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I join with other coalition regional senators passionate about education, Senator Nash and Senator Back, to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations for inquiry on 11 October this year, on which a report was tabled in the Senate. With Senator Back, I sit on that committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A report released this month from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research identified that my home state, Victoria, provided a third of all state and territory investment in training delivery and support in 2011, and provides a million more subsidised enrolments in vocational education than any other state. So, when the other side likes to point the finger at those of us in the coalition from Victoria and make commentary around our state's commitment to the vocational education sector, it would be good for them to also note that we provide more subsidised enrolments than any other state. Given that international education is Victoria's largest export sector, worth $4.8 billion to the economy, it is a most worthwhile investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill at hand seeks to strengthen the VET FEE-HELP scheme, based on recommendations from the 2011 post implementation review prepared on behalf of the Department of Education Employment and Workplace Relations, and the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education's redesign discussion paper, released earlier this year. A significant proportion of the evidence base stems from the trialled extension to VET FEE-HELP in my state, Victoria, as part of an agreement between state and Commonwealth governments to reform the TAFE sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to note that the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, Senator Evans, is on record just last month as saying that Labor's student demand-driven system of allocating places has not worked and is failing to meet the needs of employers. I welcome that admission, as one has to recognise a problem before they can start to rectify it. Indeed, Labor's system in Victoria produced an absolute explosion in lifestyle type courses such as personal training. I have a sports science degree. I am not adverse to personal training. I encourage everyone: if you cannot get out there and do it yourself, get someone with the qualifications to help you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, when we think about the training sector, it is about being able to deliver skills to our employment sector. I am not sure we need as many personal trainers in Victoria—I know we have a little bit of an issue down south—as were being produced under the Labor government's demand-driven system. The coalition government has been working on fixing that. The Victorian coalition government's commitment to change VET for the better will support the courses that provide high-level training—for example, apprenticeships—and target support to areas of identified skills shortages—and, let me tell you, personal trainers ain't one of them—or those that make an important contribution to the state's economy and Victoria's chances of gainful employment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back to the legislation at hand, schedule 1 of the bill removes the need for providers to be a body corporate, to try to increase RTO uptake of the scheme. It also introduces different compliance requirements based on the provider's compliance risk level. I note that, in its submission to the Senate committee inquiry, the Australian Council for Private Education and Training raised concerns about:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a distinct lack of detail around how risk will be determined and applied and how this will in turn influence the Minister’s approval and reporting requirements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very important query, one I am sure all providers would like the government to respond to. If the minister has an opportunity in her closing remarks, it might be a great time to comment on ACPET's issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 of schedule 1 relaxes the restriction on VET FEE-HELP to courses at the diploma, graduate diploma and graduate certificate level. It will enable other appropriate courses to be covered by the scheme, such as certificate IV courses set as prerequisites for further education. Consequently, this measure will meaningfully assist prospective students who may have found the costs of such prerequisite courses prohibitive. I welcome this sensible amendment as a measure to assist and increase participation of those who have been unable to complete year 12.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Continuing on the theme raised by previous coalition speakers, year 12 completion is a particular issue in regional areas. We have lower rates. In urban areas the rate of completion of year 12 is 81 per cent of students. In regional areas, it is 67 per cent. This means that those certificate IV courses that students can attend are actually a stepping stone for them to be able to access higher education, something that we are passionate about increasing. We are also obviously interested in ensuring that more young people, whether they are from regional or urban areas, take up the great careers that are afforded by skills training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2, part 1, puts protections in place regarding revocation of approvals. As the bill currently stands, organisations can continue to enrol and offer students VET FEE-HELP, despite being advised that their approval is about to be revoked, until the often protracted parliamentary process, being across 15 sitting days, has concluded. These particular amendments offer some degree of protection to students as well as to taxpayers' money in such circumstances, as the minister's decision will take effect on the date the notice is registered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of schedule 2 seeks to improve information sharing with the sector's regulators, including the Australian Skills Quality Authority and Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, to help streamline the approval process and sooner identify low-quality or high-risk providers. Given that the post implementation review revealed approvals were averaging 200 days and the maximum time taken was a staggering 851 days—a couple of years; nearly three—I can appreciate providers' calls for streamlined approval and compliance processes and see how the present arrangement might act as a barrier to new providers participating in the scheme. I congratulate the government on working to streamline that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minimising the compliance requirements of quality providers makes sense. Similarly, identifying and dealing with low-quality providers is essential for our students and the integrity of the system as a whole, not only for domestic students but for our international reputation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, dodgy providers must be weeded out. In the 12 months to August, the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority cancelled the registration of 75 registered training organisations in the state. The Australian Skills Quality Authority, the national body, deregistered 12 providers, three of which were in Victoria. One might wonder if the Australian Skills Quality Authority is adequately resourced to meet its regulatory responsibilities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly mention a story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> from May this year that goes to the heart, I think, of why these are important measures being delivered today by the government and not opposed by the coalition. In the story, a retired TAFE administrator was recounting his experience with dodgy course providers. Mr Brian MacDonald had discovered a local college that had supposedly closed due to inclement weather but in reality had closed due to financial collapse. Further investigation revealed that the 61 students picked up by the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE from the collapsed college had not studied a particular subject for which every single one had been certified as having passed and met the legal requirement, and that it had not even been taught. The article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr MacDonald … blames the Brumby government for starting the strife in the sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">MacDonald believes this scheme—which the government thought would save it money—bled TAFE funding dry and left the present government with little choice but to try to rein in costs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Streamlining and other Measures) Bill allows for the consolidation of several existing VET guidelines into a single instrument to increase transparency and reduce duplication of requirements. However, a number of submitters to the EEWR inquiry such as Victoria's RMIT University felt they could not duly appraise the impact of this and other aspects of the bill given the lack of available detail. This lack of detail was raised in discussion around the water amendment bill and other pieces of legislation that we are being asked to examine. RMIT evidence to the committee stated:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… most of the practical detail will come into effect through the proposed new VET Guidelines. Without seeing these Guidelines, RMIT must reserve its judgment on the changes, as the detail is required to enable institutions to make an informed assessment of its implications.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We keep asking irrigator bodies, universities, TAFE providers and the community to make judgement calls on how particular pieces of legislation will impact their business, impact their industry and impact them personally, yet we do not give them the actual detail to allow them to do that. It appears RMIT is rightly conscious that, as with so many things this government promises, the devil is in the detail.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final schedule of this bill, schedule 4, includes amendments to census date requirements, with the intent of affording providers greater flexibility to respond to student and industry needs, as the sector was designed to do. This amendment recognises that the initial one-size-fits-all approach to administering this scheme did not accommodate the inherent market differences between universities and VET providers. Whilst I am talking about one-size-fits-all policy, I draw the Senate's attention to some concerns that the Australian Council for Private Education and Training expressed around the risk based approach in the legislation. They were concerned that the approach outlined in the explanatory memorandum would automatically deem public providers to be either low-risk or high-risk providers. In evidence, they stated they were of:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the firm view that the VET sector has a sophistication and complexity beyond a simple dichotomy of the public/private divide and therefore this dichotomy should not play a significant part of the risk assessment process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw this yesterday with our conversation about the equal employment for women in the workplace bill.

We certainly have a very strange situation here. On the one hand the government is making changes to VET FEE</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">-</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">HELP to remove barriers to education, while simultaneously increasing barriers for those wanting to access tertiary education by moving these amendments, which effectively abandons the indexation of the student start-up scholarships over the next number of years. It is an extraordinary situation, to say the least. When the </span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">government made changes to the Y</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">outh </span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">A</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">llowance in 2010, while there we</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">re some components of it that the c</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">oalition was vehemently against</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">,</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> we recognise</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">d</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;"> that there were some </span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">good measures in those changes. We are always happy to give credit where credit is due, and there were some good measures in those changes.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The start-up scholarships provide start-up funding to help with things such as books and specialised equipment for students, and that is a very sensible measure. To see the government now turn around and take away the indexation from the start-up scholarships is nothing short of extraordinary. We have a situation where the government say that they are trying to make things easier for students with the primary bill, yet with the amendments they are introducing they are making it harder. It simply makes no sense to those of us on this side of the chamber. Or perhaps it does indeed make sense: it makes sense because the government have got the nation's finances into such a parlous state that they are now simply having to claw back money from wherever they can find it, in what they deem as an appropriate place, to try and shore up the economic mess that they have created. On this side, we certainly believe that students are not the place that should be targeted to try and sort out this economic mess that the government have indeed created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister talks about equity in education. How she can then sign off on the amendment for this legislation, which is going to make it harder for students, is nothing short of extraordinary. We have seen massive cuts of $2.4 billion to education and training in the MYEFO. Just to outline them for the chamber, we have seen: a freezing of the Sustainable Research Excellence program of $498 million; an end to the facilitation performance funding of $270 million from 2014; deferral of student support for masters by research degrees of $167 million; and the freeze on student start-up scholarships of $82.3 million. It is also alarming that we are seeing in regional areas only 33 per cent of students going on to tertiary education, compared to 55 per cent in the cities. I would say that there are some real concerns with this amendment, particularly in regional areas, because the government is saying one thing and doing another. The Prime Minister says she believes in equity in education, and yet we see this amendment to this bill indicates precisely the opposite. It is not surprising that people are becoming incredibly disappointed with this government. We now see the $140 billion debt is leading to measures, like we are seeing today in this chamber, which will provide a measure that is going to make things more difficult for students—quite extraordinary indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I indicated that the coalition will not be opposing this particular amendment, I think it is very important to place on record that the government has indeed made things more difficult for students. This follows on from things like the independent youth allowance parental cap of $150,000. How stupid is that! We have a financial assistance measure whereby students are to prove that they are independent of their parents, and the government is saying: 'If your parents earn $150,000 combined'—before tax, mind you—'you are completely ineligible for independent youth allowance.' That is just simply wrong. We are potentially talking about a school teacher and a police officer out in the regional areas whose combined income would preclude their student from being able to access independent youth allowance, having perhaps taken the provision to work hard for 12 months to prove themselves independent. It is just another example of the stupidity of this government, putting barriers in place for students in regional areas when it comes to accessing education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the Prime Minister's continual comments about providing equity of access to students when this government is simply not. We have this amendment here before us and, in speaking to it, I am highlighting the fact that when it comes to equity in access to education for students, the government says one thing and simply does another. People across Australia, particularly in regional areas, are indeed very well aware of that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  The Greens do not support the government's proposed amendments to delay the indexation of the student start-up scholarships from 1 January next year to January 2017. These amendments really put up in flashing lights the government's failure to public education, and in particular to students in a difficult situation, whether they have a low income for various reasons or they are in regional and rural areas. What is also now up in flashing lights is the coalition. We have heard a very interesting speech from Senator Nash. She has set out very clearly the problems with this amendment, but also stated very clearly that the coalition would not be opposing it. We could stop this amendment going through. The Greens are not going to be voting for it and it should not be supported. Senator Nash said very clearly that it makes no sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scholarship is provided to students who meet the lower economic income criteria of various income support payments to help meet the exorbitant costs of textbooks and other study materials. We have it there, because it is a recognition that these students are already struggling economically. We have all had experience of going to many of these areas—I think most of us have, because I have heard many speeches in parliament about the difficulties students and their families are facing in coping with education costs. This has been an important measure. To gouge a group of disadvantaged people who are being urged to overcome multiple barriers of disadvantage to attend full-time study and acquire further qualifications for the future economic necessity of Australia is simply wrong. It is actually deeply offensive. Let us remember all of those speeches from the Prime Minister and her ministers about a skilled nation. We need to be providing pathways for people across the country to come into our education system, yet we have just put up a barrier until 2017. It is extraordinary. It is as though it will never come back again. This cut is part of an over $1 billion cut in higher education support for students, research and universities. It is a most backwards and very short-sighted step.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at what is happening in some of the comments that are being made about these amendments. Senator Nash spoke very effectively in exposing the government's hypocrisy in saying one thing and doing another, but she has actually done exactly the same thing herself with her speech. She has got the experience from regional areas. I have been outside this parliament on platforms where she has spoken in detail about these problems. She has done it many times in this chamber with her colleagues. But she has actually highlighted the hypocrisy of the Liberals and Nationals. I urge that we vote together to block this and that the government pulls it. At this time, to bring forward a delay in the indexation of the start-up scholarships is so deeply wrong.</span>

There is no change to the Relocation Scholarships; the changes are to the youth allowance scholarships, or start-up scholarships. The government does have a strong record of investment in higher education and supporting students over a longer period of time. The $2,050 payments will remain, to assist eligible students. And the MYEFO savings are only $1.5 billion with respect to higher education.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to Schedule 1, the purpose of which is to strengthen the Commonwealth's serious drug offences framework. Illicit drugs have a serious impact on the Australian community and are the cause a wide range of social, economic and personal harms. The bill's explanatory memorandum states that the amendments in this schedule ensure that Commonwealth laws are up to date and allow for flexible, quick responses to new and emerging drug threats—for example, substances that seek to mimic the effects of other illicit drugs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">from the Criminal Code to the regulations; establish conditions and criteria for listing controlled and border controlled substances in regulations; amend emergency determination mechanisms by extending the listing period and refining the criteria to be satisfied before a determination can be made.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service are responsible for managing the security and integrity of Australia's borders, including the detection of illicit drugs and other contraband substances. Customs officers work hard day and night to detect and deter unlawful movements of goods and people across the border. Australian customs officers do a marvellous job under tough circumstances, particularly considering the damaging staff and budgetary cuts this government have inflicted upon them. Unfortunately, they are also being stretched due to the government's mismanagement of our borders—one of the most infamous legacies of this lamentable period of Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office three years ago, the Labor Party has cut funding to Customs for cargo screening, making Australia's borders less secure and our nation more vulnerable to the threat posed by illicit drugs. In the 2009-10 budget, Labor cut the budget of Customs for cargo screening by a massive $58.1 million. This cut to screening by the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments reduced the number of potential sea cargo inspections by 25 per cent. Labor's cuts also resulted in a reduction of 75 per cent to air cargo inspections. In the recent Customs annual report, it was revealed that only 4.3 per cent of sea cargo—a trivial amount in the scheme of things—is X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent—some one in 200 items—of sea cargo is physically examined. It was also of concern to learn that a staggering 95.7 per cent of all sea cargo consignments are not X-rayed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no wonder that illicit drugs are slipping through onto our streets under Labor when only 13.3 per cent of air cargo consignments are X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of air cargo is physically examined. There is a direct cause and effect relationship between the growth of the problem of illicit drugs on our streets and the Labor Party's massive budgetary cutbacks to Customs—itself a consequence of the Labor Party's inability to manage the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has become clear is that Labor's cuts to Customs' cargo and vessel inspection system put Australians, particularly young Australians, at risk by giving a boost to organised criminal gangs that smuggle illicit drugs and weapons into the country. The Labor government prefers to tinker around the edges rather than ensure our law enforcement agencies are appropriately resourced to perform their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to the serious and growing threat of identity crime. Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to expand identity crime offences in the Criminal Code and create new offences and powers relating to air travel and the use of false identities. Law enforcement agencies, such as the Australian Federal Police, have identified identity crime as a significant threat to Australians and one of the fastest growing species of crime in Australia. Australians have been quick to adopt the internet in their lives and businesses. For many Australians, it is now part of their daily routine for talking to friends and family, studying, shopping and paying bills. Similarly, businesses have embraced the internet and other information technology to improve efficiency, improve the quality of service and gain access to new markets. Regrettably, this has also created new prospects for criminals who seek to access personal and corporate secrets, steal resources and intimidate internet-reliant businesses. Additionally, the global community continues to experience an increase in the scale, sophistication and successful perpetration of cybercrime and identity theft. As the extent and importance of electronic information has increased, so too have the efforts of criminals and other malicious actors who have adopted the internet as a more convenient, anonymous and profitable method of conducting their criminal activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unfortunate that the Labor government does not appreciate the key role the Australian Federal Police plays in protecting Australia's security in this arena, as in other arenas. Since it came to office, Labor has cut a staggering $264.5 million from the AFP, including a cut of a massive $133 million in the current budget alone. The AFP's High Tech Crime Operations Centre, led by Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan, does an outstanding job considering the limited resources it has available to it and the constant evolution of the cyberthreat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments made by this bill seek to extend existing identity crime offences to the use of identification information to commit foreign indictable offences, in addition to Commonwealth indictable offences. This is directed at individuals who are located in Australia and engage in international identity crime. The internet and other new technologies provide ideal vehicles for organised criminal syndicates to capture and exploit the identity information of others. Part 1 of the schedule seeks to introduce the new offence of dealing in identity information using a carriage service such as the internet. This will capture individuals who use the internet to make, supply or use identification information with the intent of passing themselves, or someone else, off as the person identified in the information for the purpose of committing an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 of schedule 2 includes amendments that are aimed at enabling law enforcement agencies to target individuals who travel by air under false identities. The aim is specifically to prevent individuals involved in organised crime from taking flights under false identities in order to commit or facilitate the commission of crimes and avoid police detection. The coalition has long been of the view that more needs to be done on this front, including in our maritime and aviation sectors, which have been infiltrated by organised criminal networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement held an inquiry into the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime, and it reported in June 2011. The committee heard evidence that individuals involved in organised crime had regularly been travelling by air under false identities in order to avoid police detection and facilitate criminal activities, such as money laundering and illicit drug trafficking. Surprisingly, it is not currently an offence to use false information to travel by air. Accordingly, the committee recommended the creation of this new offence to reduce a vulnerability that is being exploited by criminal networks. This amendment will also allow police officers the power to request identity information from individuals where the police officer holds a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a serious criminal offence. The coalition supports measures that thwart the attempts of criminal syndicates to take advantage of lax conditions. However, it is unfortunate that it has taken the government almost a year and a half to act on these recommendations and respond to an urgent problem with appropriate swiftness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill makes some technical amendments relating to the functions of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner, the value of penalty units, and superannuation orders. The coalition supports those measures. They are not controversial and they reflect an appropriate contemporising of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the bill makes a numbers changes to Commonwealth criminal law, largely to tighten and clarify existing legislation, which has the coalition's support. The bill was the subject of an inquiry and report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which reported yesterday. The committee unanimously recommended that the bill be passed. The bill has the support of the coalition and I commend it to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious Drugs, Identity Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012. As the nature of crime changes and as technology changes, it is important that we give police the tools they need to keep up with emerging criminal trends and threats. This is particularly the case with organised crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes a series of amendments to existing criminal legislation to strengthen the law and the Commonwealth's response to these threats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the bill has a number of provisions, I will be focusing my contribution to the debate on this bill mainly on a particular type of crime—that is, identity theft. I take a particular interest in identity theft because I have come across so many stories about it through my work as Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety. Identity theft particularly came to the fore as one of the many threats facing seniors during the committee's inquiry into cybersafety for senior Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This crime involves using an individual's personal details, usually obtained through deceitful or fraudulent means, to assume their identity. It is commonly used for financial gain, with the victim usually being the person whose identity has been stolen. There are a number of ways of stealing personal information for identity theft, but the most common method is known as 'phishing'. Phishing generally involves sending an email purporting to be from an official source, such as a financial institution or a lottery, or someone asking the recipient to act as an intermediary in the transfer of funds. The purpose of the email is to fool the recipient into sending personal details, such as their user name, address, date of birth, tax file number, driver's licence number, passport number, passwords or credit card details. Phishing emails usually entice their victims through offers of money and will direct them to a website, often a mirror of the website of the company they are purporting to represent, to add to their perceived legitimacy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2007, the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a survey about personal fraud. The survey reported that 57,800 Australians had responded to phishing emails and 124,000 Australians had been victims of identity theft. I know that that number has grown substantially because of the way technology is changing so quickly. Phishing scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated, as was indicated by evidence given to the cybersafety committee by the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO has received complaints about a scam involving a fraudulent email offering a tax refund. A link in the email directs the recipient to a bogus website which then asks them to provide their personal details, including credit card details. The scammers have gone to great lengths to make the email and the website look as authentic as possible and—unlike the well-known Nigerian and lottery scams, which entice their victims with large and, frankly, unbelievable sums of money—the tax refund scam offers what appears to be a credible sum, in the hundreds of dollars and not a round figure, so people are tricked a bit more easily.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cybercriminals are becoming so brazen that cybercrime brokers are posting advertisements in online discussion forums promoting their services. The Australian Crime Commission in its submission to the cybersafety for seniors inquiry said that some of the information for sale included credit card details, magnetic strip coding and personal identification numbers, hacked payment clearing company account data, bank logins and stolen identities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Federal Police in its submission to the inquiry identified superannuation fraud as an emerging risk for identity crime and identity theft. This is worrying because of the large amount of savings held in superannuation funds but particularly because a lot of victims are not aware that they have had their identity stolen until many years after the crime has been committed. So this bill is really important to making sure we keep Australians safe while they are online. Superannuation fraud usually results in the offenders transferring funds into self-managed accounts or applying for hardship payments. Obviously it causes devastation for the victims, many of whom lose their life savings. That is another grave consequence of identity crime committed online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to some other evidence we have had, a lot of seniors are reluctant to use internet banking or other online services because of concerns about the lack security around their financial information or access to bank accounts and credit cards. It is unfortunate that so many people who could benefit greatly from the use of online services miss out on those benefits because of the fear of these risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The social cost of identity crime and identity theft actually extends well beyond those directly affected. Modern technology, particularly internet technology, is delivering fantastic social and economic benefits by providing users with new tools to transact with business, government, friends and family. But it is also providing new and sophisticated tools to cybercriminals, who have no qualms about using identities or personal information for their own financial gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the online environment is not the only avenue for identity thieves, it is where they are finding most of their new opportunities, and it is so important that our law enforcement capabilities keep up with these criminals. It is vital that our law enforcement authorities have the tools to combat identity theft, and the bill currently before the Senate at least provides some of the legislative tools necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill broadens the definition of identity crime offences, making it an offence to deal in identification information to commit foreign indictable offences, not just Commonwealth indictable offences. This will strengthen the current regime for identity crime by capturing individuals located in Australia who engage in international identity crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces the new offence of dealing in identity information using a carriage service. This will capture people who use the internet to make, supply or use identification information for the purpose of committing or facilitating a Commonwealth, state, territory or foreign offence. The bill also adds a new series of offences to the Criminal Code of using a false identity to purchase an air ticket or to travel by air.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution, today I am focusing primarily on identity crime as this is an area of great interest to me, but there are a number of other provisions in the bill. Due to the shortage of time today I will just mention them quickly, but they are no less important than those around identity crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will enable new substances to be listed more quickly under the Commonwealth's serious drug offences framework; increase the value of the penalty unit for Commonwealth criminal offences and provide for its regular review to keep pace with inflation; clarify that a superannuation order can be made in relation to employer funded contributions and benefits accrued during all periods of Commonwealth employment, not just the particular period of employment in which an employee committed a corruption offence; and strengthen the Commonwealth law enforcement integrity system by clarifying the functions of the Integrity Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In commending the bill to the Senate I would like to congratulate the Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, for her hard work in bringing Australia's criminal law up to date with emerging threats and issues. In an increasingly connected global society, and with the emergence of faster and better communications technology, organised crime is truly becoming more sophisticated than ever before. As society changes and as technology changes, so must the provisions of our criminal law. We need to give our law enforcement authorities the legislative tools to combat crime in the 21st century. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUNDY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious Drugs, Identity Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and all senators, including opposition senators, for their support for this bill. I also thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its report and recommendations that the Senate pass this bill. This bill delivers on the government's continuing commitment to combatting serious and organised crime and corruption. It ensures that we have the right laws in place to counter identity crime, drug importation and white-collar crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to points raised in the debate, I know Senator Brandis has raised the issue of the budgets of law enforcement agencies. The fact is that border protection and law enforcement budgets have been substantially increased since 2007. Our agencies are also increasingly successful in seizing illegal drugs and disrupting serious and organised crime. This is because Customs and the Australian Federal Police are using criminal intelligence and targeting instead of relying on X-ray alone. In developing the budget, the Commonwealth consulted law enforcement agencies to ask whether they want more screening or more criminal intelligence, and law enforcement agencies indicated that they want more criminal intelligence. That is why the government has established a firearms intelligence targeting team within Customs and has invested about $100 million in a new Australian Federal Police forensics facility to do things like firearms testing and bullet tracing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the agencies, it is also important to note—and I ask Senator Brandis, respectfully, to do so—that the Australian Crime Commission's budget is more than $20 million higher now than it was in 2007, the Customs and Border Protection Service budget is $67 million higher than it was in 2007, the Australian Federal Police budget is more than $340 million higher and there are 600 more sworn Australian Federal Police than there were back in 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does all this mean when it comes to fighting serious crime? It means getting impressive results. Last year we seized more heroin, more cocaine and more amphetamines than ever before. In July we seized half a billion dollars worth of illegal drugs, the largest seizure of ice in Australian history and the third-largest heroin seizure. That is more than we often seize in an entire year. The amount of drugs and illicit materials we have seized in air cargo has more than doubled since 2007. In 2007, Customs detected some 870 parcels containing drugs or other prohibited items. Last financial year, using criminal intelligence and targeting, Customs detected over 1,800 parcels. That is quite an extraordinary increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will allow drug laws to keep pace with the market for new and emerging drugs by moving lists of illicit substances from the Criminal Code to regulations. This will make it substantially quicker to update the list in response to new threats and will make the list more responsive to law enforcement needs. The government is committed to minimising the impact of harmful drugs in Australia, as you can see from these measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also target identity crime, which is one of the fastest-growing crimes in Australia. The government's comprehensive identity security strategy will be bolstered by expanding identity crime offences to cover people who use a carriage service, such as the internet or a mobile phone, to obtain identification information with the intention of committing another offence. It will also criminalise the use of identity information with the intent to commit a foreign offence. Travelling under a false identity is a tactic commonly used by organised criminals in Australia and overseas to evade law enforcement detection, and this bill will make it a crime to use a false identity to book a flight over the internet or to use a false identity when identifying oneself for the purposes of travelling on a flight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also increase the value of the penalty unit by more than 50 per cent, to $170. This increase ensures that financial penalties provide a strong deterrent to white-collar criminals in serious and organised crime groups. Corruption will be targeted by making improvements to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 and the Commonwealth superannuation order laws. Finally, this bill represents a significant step in the effort to combat serious and organised crime and white-collar crime, and I commend it to the chamber.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  Today I want to draw attention to two issues of concern currently being championed by the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians and about which I have spoken previously in the chamber. These are the need for our parliament to take action on promoting healthy body image by putting tighter regulations on digital enhancement of media images and opposing the premature sexualisation of children and young people through overtly sexual advertising. I am sure everyone in this chamber is well aware of its damaging effect on the self-esteem and the wellbeing of young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last year the American Medical Association released a scathing assessment of the advertising industry in that country. The association pointed to the large body of literature linking media propagated images of unrealistic body image to eating disorders and other child and adolescent health problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Barbara McAneny, spokesperson for the AMA, said, 'We must stop exposing impressionable children and teenagers to advertisements portraying models with body types only attainable with the help of photo editing software.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the photoshopping of media images is not the sole contributing factor to the widespread problems of depression, eating disorders and social isolation which plague young people. It has, however, been identified in country after country as a major contributing factor and one which can and should be regulated by responsible governments. It comes as no surprise then that in recent years attempts have been made around the world to introduce legislation mandating that digitally enhanced photographs of models carry disclosure statements. These are statements that would inform consumers that the image they were viewing had been altered and was not an accurate representation of the model photographed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009 a group of UK parliamentarians, led by Jo Swinson MP, sought to introduce such legislation because, as Swinson pointed out, 'There's a problem out there. Half of young women between 16 and 21 say they would consider cosmetic surgery and we've seen eating disorders more than double in the last 15 years. The way excessive retouching'—of digital images—'has become pervasive in our society is contributing to that problem.' Also in 2009, French parliamentarian Valerie Boyer and 50 of her parliamentary colleagues proposed a similar law, which would apply not only to advertisements but also to press photos, political campaigns, art photography and photos on product packaging. French parliamentarians proposing these laws considered disclosure statements to be in the interests not only of public health but also of consumer protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2011 in Norway, Audun Lysbakken, the minister for children and equality, pushed for warning labels to help consumers, particularly young people, distinguish between digitally altered images and unaltered ones. Minister Lysbakken bemoaned the fact that in Norway hundreds of thousands of young girls endured eating disorders while living with a distorted self-image obtained partly by hopeless comparisons with digitally distorted beauty ads. I might add that this issue does not pertain just to young women; it also affects young men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the global groundswell against the undisclosed digital enhancement of photographic images in advertising, it was no surprise that the government of Israel achieved success in March this year in introducing laws to mandate disclosure. It is now law that any advertisement published for the Israeli market must have a clearly written notice disclosing if the model shown in it was digitally altered. I have referred to Israel in my previous speeches. The facts have been put before this chamber previously. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to urge this parliament not to be left behind by this international groundswell. Let's place ourselves at the forefront of the international push to require disclosure of digitally altered images in advertising not only as a matter of public health but also as a matter of protecting consumer rights to the accurate presentation of images in advertising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me now turn attention from the need to regulate the digital enhancement of media images to the need for us to oppose, as a parliament, the premature sexualisation of children and young people through overtly sexual advertising. In April this year the Australian Medical Association called for a new inquiry into the premature sexualisation of children in marketing and advertising. They have subsequently been joined by media commentators and social policy advocates also insisting on the need for a new inquiry. I would urge the parliament to support this call.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts undertook an inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the contemporary media environment. The committee consulted widely with the community, received many informative and helpful submissions and came up with a raft of excellent recommendations. The inquiry put the onus on broadcasters, publishers, advertisers, retailers and manufacturers to take into account widespread community concerns. Of its 13 recommendations, we as a government have acted on two: funding a children's channel on the ABC and amending the children's television standards. There has been little action on other recommendations, including a longitudinal study into the effects of sexualisation on children, a review of music video classification, improved complaints and vetting systems and a review of the progress which was due within 18 months of the release of the 2008 report. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, a private member's motion was moved in the House of Representatives highlighting concerns about the premature sexualisation of children in the media. The motion had the support of members from the major parties. And yet still, as Dr Steve Hambleton of the Australian Medical Association pointed out, we are left with a system of self-regulation by the advertising industry which is clearly not working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> show in April this year, Dr Hambleton revealed that the AMA decided to go public about their concerns because of a spate of advertisements appearing in the Australian media which featured very young children in images and with messages that were disturbing and sexually exploitative. 'These are highly sexualised ads that target children, and the advertising industry is getting away with it,' Dr Hambleton said. Dr Hambleton spoke of the research linking sexualised advertising with depression and eating disorders in young people as well as creating a blurring of normal sexual development in children and young people. 'There is strong evidence that premature sexualisation is likely to be detrimental to child health and development, particularly in the areas of body image and sexual health,' Dr Hambleton said. Further, he stated, 'The current self-regulatory approach through the Advertising Standards Bureau is failing to protect children from sexualised advertising.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, complaints about ads go to the Advertising Standards Bureau, which considers each case by reference to a code of ethics. In theory the code deems that the implication of sexual appeal in any image of a child 'will always be regarded as exploitative and degrading'. But critics say that too many ads slip through the net and that the bureau's decisions are not binding. Advertisers are simply asked to modify or withdraw ads deemed to breach the code. An increasing number of parent groups want tougher and binding regulations. Among these groups are Collective Shout and Kids Free 2B Kids, which target products and marketing that sexualise children.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Monday the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians group hosted a Twitter forum on the topic of body image and the sexualisation of children in the media. We received several hundred comments and, on the basis of these, we perceived that the dominant mood of the public is of frustration at the amount of sexualisation going on and cynicism about the commitment of politicians to back up parents by enforcing community standards in advertising and the media. Some of the comments we received were:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems, at least anecdotally, that the mood in the community concurs with the view of the AMA that stronger action is needed to stop the practice of pushing adult themes to young children. In its statement in April the AMA said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We urge the Government to start a new Inquiry with the view to introducing tougher measures, including legislation, to protect the health and development of our children by shielding them from sexualised and other inappropriate advertising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the AMA statement in April other media commentators and social policy advocates have come out in support of Dr Hambleton. They point to significant new research which has been done since the 2008 inquiry, exploring the links between sexualisation of children in the media and detrimental health outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put it to you, my parliamentary colleagues, that the mounting body of new evidence from Australia and overseas needs to be reviewed and considered with a view to introducing more realistic and enforceable regulation of the advertising industry. We need to decide as elected representatives what is more important for our society: that the advertising industry flourish unfettered, regardless of whose welfare they might be putting at risk, or that we show enough concern for younger members of our society at vulnerable stages of their development to examine the research and introduce legislation which protects their right to healthy development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken on numerous occasions in this chamber about the sexualisation of children in advertising. I know that there is a lot of support around the chamber for the idea that changes be made to advertising regulations, and I urge my colleagues to support a review of the regulations. The onus is on us to protect the most vulnerable people in our community. Without a doubt the greatest gift we can give to our community is the protection of our young people and children. I urge this parliament to support calls for a new inquiry into the sexualisation of children in advertising and media.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I quote from the transcript of a press conference in Canberra on 29 April. In it the Prime Minister says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the highest standards which must be upheld in public life is trust. The Prime Minister herself has failed the fundamental requirement of upholding the standard of trust. But it is not just me who is saying so; her own side is also saying so.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unmistakably implicit in that comment from Senator Cameron is that this Prime Minister is not trusted. According to Senator Doug Cameron, this Prime Minister is not trusted. What have been some of the breaches of the highest standards of trust that we have seen under the watch of this Prime Minister? The first of them was the promise given by the Prime Minister before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' I wonder whether that was the comment Senator Cameron was referring to when he said 'caused problems during the election campaign' and 'made promises that were unfulfilled'. So the first breach of trust by this Prime Minister occurred before the last election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second breach of trust relates to the Craig Thomson affair and the start of the prime ministerial protection racket, a prime ministerial protection racket which has breached that fundamental element of leadership—trust. The community is well aware of the matters raised about Mr Thomson back in 2009. The public is aware of the sordid details of his behaviour and I will not go through those today. But we know this affair commenced in 2009 and we know that it was back then that one of the senior staff members of the Prime Minister, then the minister responsible, contacted Fair Work Australia or its predecessor about it. That was the start of the Prime Minister's involvement in the Craig Thomson affair. The protection of Craig Thomson was about protecting a wafer-thin majority—and the standards applied in attempting to achieve that were also wafer thin. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 August, she again said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the second part of this Prime Minister's protection racket, the second breach of trust in relation to parliamentary standards—and that of course revolved around the former Speaker. This is the second element behind Senator Doug Cameron's reflections on what the perceptions of the Prime Minister are. I will not go through the allegations made against Mr Slipper because, again, they are on the public record—as sordid as they are, they are on the public record. But I will refer to the Prime Minister's ongoing protection of both Mr Slipper and Mr Thomson. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder what drove the extraordinary turnaround on 29 April this year, when these immortal words were used by the Prime Minister:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To put it at its most simple, I think there is a line which has been crossed here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only line which was crossed here was with the Labor Party's internal polling. The protection racket had been going on for years. This is a Prime Minister who had stood up day after day, who had supported the member for Dobell and who had supported the member for Fisher. She only moved when it became too hard, on the back of internal Labor Party polling, to continue the protection racket. Then and only then did the Prime Minister move. I thought it was interesting that, at that press conference, Michelle Grattan asked the Prime Minister:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Prime Minister, do you accept that you have made a serious error of judgement in both these matters? Did you consult widely with your cabinet in coming to these decisions, and haven't you left Anthony Albanese out to dry after defending Mr Slipper up hill and down dale over the last few days?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister, as part of the protection racket, did indeed leave Mr Albanese hanging out to dry. It was only when she got Labor Party internal polling indicating that they were suffering that she moved. She had had the opportunity to do so months before—if not years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will move on now to some comments made by Mr Warren Mundine after his retirement. I think Mr Mundine summed up this Prime Minister, summed up her approach to politics and summed up her absolute obsession with the retention of power. He was talking about Indigenous issues—the disparity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It became more about the politics than actually achieving anything. And I began to start losing faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Mundine knew it was about the politics and never about the policy. One of the great warriors of the Australian Labor Party felt motivated to leave his own party on the back of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third part of the protection racket does not involve Mr Thomson or Mr Slipper; it involves the Prime Minister herself. This is the self-protection racket. This Prime Minister, on the back of one misused word in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>—they referred to 'trust fund' instead of 'slush fund'—has attempted to inoculate herself completely from answering any questions about the slush fund. She used that one word to run an hour-long press conference and has refused to answer any questions since. Thankfully there are those in the press gallery here and elsewhere who are prepared to stand up to the Prime Minister. There is, of course, the usual conga line of apologists who refuse to do so, but even they are now coming under enormous pressure to start asking the Prime Minister the questions she must answer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 November in the other place, deputy opposition leader Julie Bishop asked Ms Gillard:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Why did not the Prime Minister herself report the fraud involving the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association that she helped establish?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Gillard replied:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">By the time the matter she refers to came to my attention they were already the subject of inquiry and investigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The self-protection racket is now failing—the defences are being proven false. It is time this Prime Minister stopped hiding behind the misuse of one word, hiding behind an hour-long press conference and hiding behind a refusal to answer any questions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

I want to demonstrate how low this government and this Prime Minister have sunk. I want to talk about a gentleman by the name of Mr McTernan. Andrew Probyn's article on 2 March this year went a long way towards explaining this. He quoted a comment made by Mr McTernan, who of course worked for former Prime Minister Blair in Britain for 12 years. Mr McTernan is quoted in the article as saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The key is to realise that you don't need to tell the whole truth, just nothing but the truth … Don't lie. Don't equivocate. But set out a defensible truth: one that you will not have to expand, modify or resile from.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Probyn goes on to say:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The thing about plausible deniability or defensible truth is that it encourages approximations of what really happened.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">And when approximations of the truth are published or alleged, spinners like Mr McTernan delight in knowing the people they are handling—in this case Ms Gillard—can deny the veracity of the approximations without dealing with the underlying truth. Mr McTernan has clearly well briefed the Prime Minister in relation to those words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish with Mr McTernan in the context of the Prime Minister's disgraceful misogyny speech. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend Australian</span> on 6 October Chris Kenny made this comment:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The theme is hard to miss and the aim is transparent. Labor wants to portray conservative criticism of Gillard as attacks on women.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The genesis of this tactic is illuminating. McTernan, a former adviser to British Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair, was brought to Australia by former South Australian Premier Mike Rann.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">In a column for Britain's <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> in 2010, McTernan declared: "The Coalition has a problem with women." He argued spending cuts proposed by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Coalition in Britain were unpopular with female voters. "This gender gap is a real and pressing problem for (British PM David) Cameron, he wrote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Last year another column on law and order issues was headed: "How many women today feel the Coalition is protecting them?" And just in case you missed the angle, a few months later McTernan focused on women promoted in British Labor's reshuffle, turning it against Cameron: "The PM has a problem with women and he knows it."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the depths that this Prime Minister and this party will sink to. We have seen the work of John McTernan in the last month. We know he was deliberately put on by this Prime Minister to achieve what he has tried to achieve in the last month, and it is not about good policy; it is about dirty politics. When you look at the comments he made about David Cameron, when you look at the comments he made about the Conservative Party in Britain and when you look at the comments made by the Prime Minister, two and two still equals four. I finish on this note: we all know the book by Graham Richardson, <span style="font-style:italic;">Whatever it takes</span>. Well, the Prime Minister has written the Labor Party bible, and she stands utterly condemned. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  Today I would like to reflect on some exchanges in the New South Wales parliament which raise issues relating to Mr Carr's judgement in relation to Mr Obeid. The basic question is whether Mr Carr should have been aware of what Mr Obeid was up to but simply averted his eyes and looked the other way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, Mr Obeid's actions over many years raised serious questions about his suitability for office and most especially about his being made a minister. Given matters before ICAC at the moment, I will not traverse those issues. I simply ask the question: does Mr Carr ever pause and reflect that, had he not promoted, protected and defended Mr Obeid, Australia would not now be in a position where its international reputation is at risk of being stained by the activities of his mates in the New South Wales right, or is the minister just a hand-washer in a remorse-free zone?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we look at some of these exchanges, I remind the Senate that Mr Obeid became a member of the Legislative Council on 12 September 1991. He remained an MLC until 10 May 2011. For almost 20 years as an upper house member he appears to have wielded an extraordinary level of power. In an article on 10 May 2011 entitled 'Obeid turns off the power and makes a quiet exit,' Sean Nicholls wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The year after entering Parliament, he and a close friend, the former federal MP Graham Richardson, arranged for the late stockbroker Rene Rivkin to buy the Offset Alpine printing press from media mogul Kerry Packer. Mr Obeid's son was made a director.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Obeid had bad luck when it came to fires. In July 1983 fire destroyed the offices of his newspaper<span style="font-style:italic;">, El Telegraph</span>, in Garners Avenue, Marrickville. Bad luck was to follow him to his newspaper's new premises in Marrickville Road, where, in 1992, there was another fire. Mr Obeid also had the misfortune of having  two fires at his former home in Concord.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just on Offset Alpine, as Kate McClymont reported on 31 October 2003, the fire at the plant turned out to be a stroke of very good luck for a group of high-profile investors. The plant was worth $4 million and the company had just taken out insurance for $53 million, with full replacement value of $42 million. But, as the article states, 'the only person to have whinged about missing out on the Offset Alpine' payout was 'ALP heavyweight Eddie Obeid', who had put the deal together.</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Brandis. Mr Carr was Premier from 4 April 1995 until 3 August 2005. Mr Obeid was Minister for Fisheries and Minister for Mineral Resources from 8 April 1999 to 2 April 2003. His time as a minister was wholly within the time of the premiership of Mr Carr. Mr Carr should have remembered the old saying 'Where there is smoke there is fire'. In Mr Obeid's case, there was lots of smoke and many fires.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Before the Premier presumes to misrepresent members of the Opposition on pecuniary interest, let us just get an answer about the Minister for Mineral Resources, and Minister for Fisheries, Eddie Obeid, who is the only Minister to have bought his place on the front bench by bankrolling backbench members of the Labor Party. He paid his way into the Ministry, and the Premier ought to reveal to this House the questions he asked the Minister for Mineral Resources, and Minister for Fisheries, Eddie Obeid, about his disclosures, what the ministerial Code of Conduct obliges the Minister to tell the Premier, and why the Premier continues to help a man who tells lies to this Parliament time and time again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all of this, Mr Carr's response was, 'There were no opposite views' and he proceeded to change the subject. He was asked: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the Premier's claims, what part has the fact that he was compromised by Eddie Obeid over his Valhalla Stables snowfield development while the Premier was Minister for the Environment played in his refusal to sack Mr Obeid—or does he have something else over you, Bob?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again Mr Carr deflected by attacking on another unrelated matter. This is the crux of the problem for Mr Carr. Is this the reason why he has continuously turned the Nelson blind eye to Mr Obeid’s activities and that, despite myriad allegations, he still saw fit to appoint Mr Obeid a minister in April 1999? Interestingly, in the second reading debate on the Environmental Planning and Assessment Amendment (Ski Resort Areas) Bill, which dealt with changes to planning for ski resort areas, Minister Obeid did not see fit to disclose any conflict of interest, despite his involvement in the Valhalla Stables lease matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 30 October 2003, the Premier was asked about business interests and ongoing scandals involving former ministers, including Mr Obeid:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… can the Premier guarantee that none of his former Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries used their positions to set up businesses or jobs to fund their retirements?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Carr's response was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that there are no issues and there is no research over there. There ain’t anything happening that the Opposition can get its teeth into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, he even boasted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have often said this is the period of best governance in the history of New South Wales.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As history has shown, Mr Carr, this was a hollow boast indeed. On 3 June 2004, questions were raised about Ms Janet Obeid and threat allegations:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Given allegations today by Eddie Obeid that his niece Janet Obeid is a "psychopath" and is pursuing a vendetta, can the Premier confirm that she has been in contact with his office to raise serious allegations about threats to her safety from the Obeid family? Has he referred this matter to the New South Wales Police for investigation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Carr completely ignored the question about somebody who rang his office for assistance. He was asked:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Does the Premier believe that Eddie Obeid is still fit to be a member of the Australian Labor Party?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The response was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He is, and as far as I know there is no move to expel him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues go to the very heart of Mr Obeid’s suitability to remain in parliament, let alone to be promoted to the ministry. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  I rise today in this matters of public interest discussion to speak on the government's Asian century white paper. We live in an age of great change for the world. Like those looking forward at the beginning of last century, the changes that this century will bring will be profound. And again, like those looking forward at the beginning of last century, we will not know what those changes will be and how they will affect our lives. But there are things that we do know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past 20 years, China and India have almost tripled their share of the global economy. They have increased their absolute economic size almost six times over. This is an extraordinary economic feat. By the end of this decade, Asia is set to overtake the economic output of Europe and North America combined. By 2025, Asia, the world's most populous region, will account for almost half the world's output, with the average gross domestic product per person in Asia set to double. Within only a few years, Asia will be not only the world's largest producer of goods and services but also the largest consumer of them, and it will be home to the majority of the world's middle class.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a rising Asian middle class, the demand for services from Australia will increase, and we must take action now to ensure that we have the skills and capacity to provide those services. We cannot delay in developing the skills we need or we will simply be left behind. When the Prime Minister launched the white paper, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has unprecedented opportunities in this Asian century of growth and change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We’ve already seen the first down-payment in our economy through the demand for our raw materials. It is prudent to get ready for what Asia will demand from us next, what Asians will next want to buy from our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As Asia changes, as it becomes home to the world's biggest middle class, then it will want to buy the things that Australia has to sell. Whether it's high quality food, top end tourism, international education, elaborately transformed manufactures, and the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the future, our prosperity lies with a deep and committed engagement with Asia. It is what we need to keep our economy strong—currently the 12th largest in the world according to the International Monetary Fund. To do this, we will need a genuine understanding of those who we will do business with: the peoples, the cultures, the languages, and their approaches to business. We must be diplomatically and commercially engaged across Asia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Asian century white paper is the Australian government's plan to make sure Australia is a winner in the Asian century. As a nation, we face a choice: to drift into our future or to actively shape it. We cannot just rely on luck—our future will be determined by the choices we make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Asian century white paper outlines how Australia needs to act in five key policy areas. Australia's prosperity will come from building on our strengths, reinforcing the foundations of our society and our productive, open and resilient economy at home. That means ongoing reform and investment across the five pillars of productivity—skills and education; innovation; infrastructure; tax reform; and regulatory reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation Australia must do even more to build the capabilities that will help Australia succeed. Our greatest responsibility is to invest in our people through education and skills to drive Australia's productivity performance and ensure that all Australians can participate in and contribute to the Asian century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's commercial engagement in the region will be most successful if highly innovative, competitive Australian firms and institutions develop collaborative relationships with others in the region. Australian firms need new business models and new mindsets to operate and connect with Asian markets. The Australian government will work to make the region more open and integrated, encouraging trade, investment and partnerships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's future is irrevocably tied to the ongoing prosperity and sustainable security of our diverse region. We have much to offer through cooperation with other nations to support sustainable security in the region. The Australian government will work to build trust and cooperation bilaterally and through existing regional mechanisms. The Australian government will continue to support a greater role for Asian countries in a rules based regional and global order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs to strengthen its deep and broad relationships across the region at every level. These links are social and cultural as much as they are political and economic. Improving people-to-people links can unlock large economic and social gains. While the Australian government plays a leading role in strengthening and building relationships with partners in the region through intensive diplomacy across Asia, others across a broad spectrum, including business, unions, community groups and educational and cultural institutions, also play an important role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The white paper sets out a number of ambitious targets for our country for the years up til 2025 to ensure Australia can fulfil its ambitions and compete effectively within Asia. These include, by 2025, Australia's GDP per person will be in the world's top 10, up from 12th, requiring a lift in our productivity. This will mean Australia's average real national income will be about $73,000 per person compared with about $62,000 in 2012.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By 2025, our school system will be in the top five in the world, and 10 of our universities in the world's top 100. Globally we will be ranked in the top five countries for ease of doing business, and our innovation system will be in the world's top 10.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Studies of Asia will be a core part of the Australian school curriculum. All students will have continuous access to a priority Asian language: Mandarin, Hindi, Indonesian and Japanese. I know how important this is personally because my son—whose birthday it is today—studied Japanese at university as one of his majors and is now living and working in Japan because of his ability to speak fluent Japanese.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an aside, I was pleased to see in a Tasmanian newspaper today, an article about grade 3 and 4 students at the Corpus Christi school in Bellerive who have started learning Indonesian. This program is now underway in four Catholic schools in Tasmania, including via an online course to St Joseph's Primary school in Queenstown on the west coast. That is another example of how the use of the internet can be used to deliver training to remote areas. The opportunities to deliver training in this matter will only increase with the rollout of the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Asian century white paper provides a target for our leaders to become more Asia literate, with one-third of board members of Australia's top 200 publicly listed companies and Commonwealth bodies having deep experience in and knowledge of Asia. Our economy will be deeply integrated with Asia with our trade links consisting of at least one-third of GDP—up from one-quarter today. Our diplomatic network will have a larger footprint across Asia, supporting stronger, deeper and broader links with Asian nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The white paper will set the strategic direction for our policy and funding measures for the whole budget. We are already investing substantial funding across the key action areas outlined in the white paper, including skills, education and infrastructure funding. The National Broadband Network will boost our ability to use our teaching resources effectively, and we will build on new and emerging technology so every child in every school has the opportunity to learn an Asian language.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These objectives will build on the work the Gillard government has already done to increase the understanding and study of Asian languages and culture, including the $62 million National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program, and Mandarin is one of the first two languages to be rolled out under the new national curriculum. To help achieve this, every school will engage with at least one school in Asia to support the teaching of a priority Asian language, including through increased use of the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australia to succeed in the Asian century, we need to equip all young Australians with a better understanding of the culture, history and languages of our Asian nations. Greater engagement with Asia will bring greater prosperity for Australia. I am particularly glad to see that the Premier of my home state of Tasmania, Lara Giddings, has already been proactive in trying to engage investors from Asia to invest in Tasmania and find new markets for Tasmanian products and to make the most of the natural advantages that Tasmania has.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania has enormous opportunities in the upcoming Asian century. Tasmania has world-leading products that the rising Asian middle class want. We have top-quality wines, cheeses, handcrafted timber products, fresh fruits and vegetables, artisan meats and honey, amongst others. We have natural resources that, through appropriate foreign capital investment, we can utilise to benefit all Tasmanians. There is enormous capacity for expansion of our education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already Tasmania has thousands of students from overseas gaining a tertiary education from the University of Tasmania and our TAFEs. Our proximity to Antarctica makes us a natural place from which to launch scientific exploration of the Southern Ocean, and I am sure that as Asian nations seek to increase their scientific understanding of the world, Hobart will be a perfect base to start their explorations from, working in partnership with Australian research organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Asian century provides us with unique opportunities. Only by putting in the groundwork now, to invest in education, to gain greater awareness of our Asian neighbours, will we have the opportunity to capitalise on the great economic and social benefits that the coming century will bring.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Today I rise to speak about a resident of Victoria, but also about a matter that is of concern to all Australians. That resident is the Leadbeater's possum. I am afraid that this wonderful part of Australia's natural history, a wonderful part of this planet's incredible biodiversity, could soon be lost forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leadbeater's possum is a tiny little marsupial. It is found only in Victoria. It is a relative of the sugar glider. It is an amazing little animal. They construct very large and intricate nests where they huddle together in families to shelter from the cold Victorian winter months. We were so proud of this animal in Victoria that in 1968 we made it Victoria's faunal emblem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The possum's habitat is on Melbourne's doorstep in the forests of the central highlands, in our magnificent mountain ash forests. Because they are not found anywhere else in the world, the future of this animal is intimately tied to these wonderful forests. Any threat to the forests means extinction for the Leadbeater's possum. In fact no-one actually saw one of these animals for over 50 years, and it was presumed to be extinct, until it was spotted again in 1961. Since its rediscovery, it has been recorded in more than 300 locations; although many of these places have been disturbed by logging and by fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Healesville Sanctuary is home to a small captive breeding population, and as part of Zoos Victoria the sanctuary's biologists are attempting to fight its extinction and trying to change the fate of threatened species like the Leadbeater's possum. The work of the expert biologists is to be commended but they do face an uphill battle. The possum is listed as a threatened species in Victoria and is classified as endangered under the EPBC Act. This has triggered the preparation of a recovery plan under Commonwealth law and an action statement in Victoria. Sadly, both the action statement and the recovery plan are out of date, and neither takes into account the destruction of half the possum's habitat in the 2009 Black Saturday fires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor David Lindenmayer, the country's foremost expert on the Leadbeater's possum, and his team from ANU have undertaken the longest forest-monitoring program in the Southern Hemisphere, 30 years in duration, in the mountain ash forests in Victoria. The consensus is very clear: the species is at great risk of extinction in the near future. Delays, underfunding, lack of political will and inadequacy of the Victorian government's response, including the Victorian government's systematic weakening of environmental legislation, has led Professor Lindenmayer to conclude that the possum is on an extinction trajectory within 25 years. Sadly, Professor Lindenmayer quit the Leadbeater's possum recovery team in Victoria earlier this year in disgust. It was reported that his resignation to the Victorian environment minister stated that the current policies were 'unable to appropriately protect' the animal and that he could no longer be a part of 'such a highly ineffective body'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1998, 5,500 Leadbeater's possums were reported in the wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and today experts quote between 1,000 and 2,000 in the wild, with only five individuals—down from seven—in captivity. We are on the verge of losing this wonderful animal and our state's faunal emblem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the loss of half the possum's habitat to fires has not being factored into the regulatory regime, under which logging takes place in the central highlands. The Victorian government is dragging its feet, underfunding reviews of these regimes and, as Professor Lindenmayer put it, 'monitoring the possum into extinction'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victoria's state-owned logging company VicForests has been criticised time and time again for unlawful logging. Each time it was only because a small passionate group of people, community groups like Environment East Gippsland and MyEnvironment, have taken them to court. The Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment, the Victorian government agency with responsibility for ensuring that logging occurs within the law, has been gutted by the Victorian government's savage budget cuts. It was recently slammed by Victoria's Auditor-General for not even knowing what it was or was not responsible for monitoring, let alone proactively auditing whether activities such as logging are occurring in accordance with the law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it happens, VicForests gets free access to Victoria's forest assets, and it is an economic model that creates a distortion in the market by favouring the logging of Victoria's native forests over plantation forestry. The free handouts and sweetheart deals do not end with free wood and free access to public lands. As a state-owned business, VicForests can call on the government to bail it out at any time if it is running low on cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without these huge subsidies, these enormous artificial commercial advantages, VicForests would go out of business. A recent report by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research on native forest logging in Victoria found that if VicForests were ever to face a level commercial playing field it would fail. If it ever had to compete directly with plantation timber growers, the market would strongly favour plantation timber, because plantation timber is commercially more sustainable and provides greater resource security than the logging and burning of our native forests. Plantations in western Victoria are estimated to produce no less than twice the volume of pulp logs than those available from VicForests under the business-as-usual case at any time between 2010 and 2049.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more shocking is the fact that despite all of these huge subsidies and artificial advantages, VicForests is losing money. I will say that again: they get their land free, they get the trees free and they still manage to lose money. This state-owned business enterprise, created by legislation with the specific purpose of returning a profit for Victoria's taxpayers, has lost money in three of the past six financial years—an incredible feat. The only reason VicForests still exists is that it has been protected by its line of credit with the Victorian government. The 2011-12 financial year was the fifth year running for which VicForests has failed to return any money to taxpayers. Victoria's priceless mountain ash forests are given away free to log and to burn. This is despite their enormous economic potential to attract tourists and to build on the region's thriving tourism sector. Those forests of great value in sequestering vast amounts of carbon for generations have also helped to maintain a clear water supply and yet all of this is being logged away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Key areas of the Leadbeater's possum habitat face the threat of logging under Victorian state laws. Timber harvesting in these areas is now removing trees that are essential nesting hollows. Along with the direct harm caused by logging and burning, habitat disturbance due to forestry activities puts even more strain on the Leadbeaters. It is therefore alarming that moves are under way to lock in 20-year contracts to log native forests with compensation payable if contracts are altered by future governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislative efforts are also under way at a state level to weaken and dismantle Victorian environmental protection legislation to facilitate these 20-year contracts. Against all of this, I acknowledge the excellent work being done to save this unique creature and its habitat from extinction. The community group Friends of Leadbeater's Possum has been working tirelessly to raise awareness about the plight of the possum. The Wilderness Society has been encouraging businesses and individuals to protect the possum's habitat by pledging not to use Reflex brand office paper until the pulp used in Reflex is no longer sourced from Leadbeater's possum habitat. Finally, Zoos Victoria has been working on a captive breeding program for the possum. It is also worth mentioning that Zoos Victoria is the largest employer in the Yarra Valley region, with 550 people directly employed and many more indirectly employed, for example, through catering, security and cleaning operations. Sustainable industries such as tourism are the future for the Yarra Ranges, not clear-fell logging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against this backdrop, the Commonwealth government is about to hand environmental decision-making powers to the states, especially those decisions relating to the natural environment. Four decades of environmental protection legislation is at risk of being set aside to allow the states to pursue short-term economic gain at any cost. The handover has three parts: firstly, the Commonwealth intends to give the states power over environmental decisions by fast tracking approval bilaterals under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. These approval bilaterals authorise states to make decisions currently made by the Commonwealth. COAG is going to agree on these arrangements by December this year and implement them by March next year. Secondly, imminent amendments to the EPBC act are set to favour the rapid approval of developments ahead of protecting species and habitats. Our environmental laws are already weak enough but this process threatens to tip the balance decisively in favour of development at any cost. Thirdly, states and territories will be allowed to reform state assessment approvals to fast track major development projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">RFAs, or regional forest agreements, are the model for approval bilaterals. RFAs are written agreements between the Commonwealth and the states that exempt logging areas from the operation of the EPBC act. The rationale for this is supposedly that environmental protection is equivalent to that offered under the act but RFAs have completely failed to protect the environment. The RFA process is flawed at every stage but perhaps most crucially, there is no enforcement. It is invariably left up to community groups and individuals to take up the battle. For example, the Federal Court found in Tasmania's Wielangta Forest case that logging has a significant impact on the Tasmanian Wedge-tailed Eagle, the Wielangta stag beetle and the Swift Parrot. In response, the Commonwealth and Tasmania changed the RFA. In Victoria's Brown Mountain case, brought by Environment East Gippsland, logging was found to be unlawful because it breached state laws to protect wildlife. Again, the Commonwealth took no action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the Senate is undertaking a threatened species inquiry—a timely examination of a loss of species in Australia. It is an important example of the work of federal representatives in monitoring the status of our biodiversity in Australia and in ensuring that species like the Leadbeater's possum are not consigned to extinction as habitat destruction is made ever easier for industry and local interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leadbeater's possum is facing extinction under the Victorian state government's appalling environmental record. The Commonwealth needs to step up and strengthen its environmental laws, not hand them over to the states. Leadbeater's possum is the perfect example of why we need to do this, and do this urgently. The regional forest agreement that brought us to this point means that the Commonwealth has already excused itself from regulating in this area and the result is that the possum is now on a rapid path to extinction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of learning a lesson from this, we are set to hand over even greater power to the states. It simply makes no sense, because as far as state governments are concerned, safeguarding our natural heritage for the long term always comes behind short-term benefits, rapid development and exploitation. The trajectory is in one direction only. Like many other iconic places in Australia, such as the Great Barrier Reef, James Price Point in the Kimberley and Kangaroo Island, the Leadbeater's possum is far too precious to lose. I fear that if the Commonwealth abrogates its responsibility to safeguard these precious places it is only a matter of time before they are gone, and gone forever. The parliament might still be able to save these national treasures but if they are gone we will never be able to bring them back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leadbeater's possum was named after John Leadbeater, who was the National Museum of Victoria's first taxidermist. It is my great fear that my children might only see this wonderful little animal in the way that John Leadbeater knew it—stuffed, sitting on a shelf in a museum and with future generations being deprived of the opportunity to see and experience part of this planet's wondrous biodiversity.</span>

Is the minister aware that Australia is a party to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions? Given the government announced last year as part of its commitment to develop and implement Australia's national anticorruption plan to amend the Commonwealth Criminal Code on foreign bribery offences, is it fair to say that the government is seeking to set a good international example on corrupt practices?

Unlike those opposite, the Gillard government are prepared to invest in the future of our country. We are in a situation where we are delivering services to people across Australia, nearly 30,000 as I have said a number of times. We are also delivering programs in the footprints of the National Broadband Network. We have had thousands of Australians who have been through these training programs, individual Australians, to give them the skills they need in the 21st century.</span>

We have had hundreds and hundreds of businesses go through these programs since March when they commenced. Those opposite may like to sign up to some of these programs so they can actually get some education. These programs are vital for Australia to take advantage of the capacity that the National Broadband Network will be providing to people's homes. This is vital for small businesses across Australia who will finally get a level playing field like other businesses in major capital cities.

I refer the minister to reports this morning that the government's failure to resolve a funding shortfall for chemotherapy will result in an increase in treatment costs of $100 per chemotherapy transfusion for cancer patients. Given that medical facilities will unlikely be able to pass on the increase in prices, does the government expect cancer patients to seek treatment in an already overcrowded public system that received a funding cut of $1.6 billion in the MYEFO, or does the government expect private centres to cough up an estimated $1 million in increased costs? Is this not just another Labor disaster in Health?</span>

Prices paid by cancer patients for PBS medicines are not affected by this price reduction. Pharmacists and hospitals cannot charge patients extra for PBS medicines; in fact, consumers benefit from cheaper drugs as government savings are used to subsidise new cancer drugs on the PBS.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2007 price disclosure on cancer drugs has saved taxpayers around $118 million. What will occur on 1 December is that the price the government pays for the cancer drug docetaxel will drop by 70 per cent, bringing the price the government pays into line with the market price. For many years pharmacists have been charging the government 20 to 75 per cent above the market price. These inflated prices have meant that the government has paid, in some instances, $2,800 above the market price for this drug.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2007 the government has committed $1.3 billion to fund 30 new or amended cancer treatments on the PBS. We are putting more money into cancer treatments. Treatment options for over 15 different cancers such as leukaemia, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bone cancer, lung cancer and bowel cancer have all been expanded under this government. Cancer drug patients pay no more than one PBS copayment for the first prescription dispensed, with no additional copayment for repeated prescriptions: in other words, a patient will pay either $5.80 or $35.40 for the first injection or infusion of the drug but not for the repeats. In some instances, the average monthly cancer treatment costs are over $5,000, so you can see there has been a lot of misinformation about it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Is the minister's answer consistent with the health minister's press release of this morning saying she would look into that, accepting that there will be increases that are difficult for patients? Is the minister also aware that St Andrew's Toowoomba Hospital in our home state of Queensland will face increased costs of between $800,000 and $1 million, and has warned of the possible closure of its cancer clinic? Why is the government abandoning vulnerable cancer patients in its increasingly desperate bid to return the budget to a surplus?</span>

That is not true. The Australian government meets the full cost of chemotherapy drugs supplied under the PBS. There are a range of separate clinical services that pharmacists provide in the treatment of cancer. These are not related to the supply of the PBS drug, but are separately funded through the hospital system. How these are funded is a matter for each individual hospital service. It is very important to separate out what the Commonwealth does. We have expanded the services in this area significantly. We have provided $1.3 billion to ensure improved cancer services. There has been no budget reduction in this area. What this government has done and continues to do— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Consistent with no advantage, people from this group going on to bridging visas will have no work rights and will receive only basic accommodation assistance and limited financial support.

These are not temporary protection visas; they are bridging visas. Of course, people on bridging visas may at some point be eligible for a permanent visa, but they will not be subject to any advantage if they arrive through irregular means—that is the difference. We will continue to regularly transfer people to Nauru and Manus Island, and will continue to return people when they do not engage in Australia's international obligations. Indeed, there have been a number of removals since 13 August and well over 250 people have been returned involuntarily to Sri Lanka. Arrangements for irregular maritime arrivals who are already in the community on bridging visas, and for those who arrived before 13 August, remain unchanged.</span>

Can the minister confirm that the Australian government agreed to the men's request to be voluntarily returned to Iran without having to answer for their alleged crimes?

These issues all relate to the operation of the Nauru centre. Can I say to Senator Brandis that in relation to the explicit matter he has asked about I would need to get additional information because I do not have any specific brief on the matter. I am very happy to do that and in the meantime, as you can hear, our work is progressing very well on Nauru. We will, of course, continue to make transfers to Nauru and to Manus Island starting today. In this way we persist with our commitment to honouring the independent advice of the expert panel and implementing the 22 recommendations. What is unfortunate is that the opposition fail to grasp the seriousness of this issue and continue to play politics with it, to their discredit. This is a challenging issue. We are committed to smashing the people smugglers' model and it is a great shame that the opposition do not share our concern and our commitment to this serious task.</span>

With respect to Captain Emad, we have answered comprehensively questions both in this chamber and at Senate estimates about the due process that was applied in that situation. The opposition are well aware of that and again this shows a propensity for them to want to play politics with this issue rather than abide by the law and due process. The answer to this question is that there is no basis for this challenge at all. We are applying the due process in relation to matters that come to hand. I have already taken on notice the specific issue Senator Brandis has raised. Once again I point to the irresponsible approach the opposition continues to take to the asylum seeker issue. We are implementing independent recommendations. We have an opposition which persists in playing politics with this, persists with its negativity.

That is the only appropriate answer to this question. Again I point to the coalition consistently trying to play politics with the asylum seeker issue. We have a record of government applying process, unlike the opposition, who when they were in government used continued political interference in relation to dealing with these matters and brought the government into disrepute at an international scale. In contrast, we will persist in applying the recommendations by the independent expert panel. We call consistently on the coalition to support our approach to the Malaysia arrangement and point to their negligence in not following through the expert panel recommendations and supporting the Malaysia arrangement, which would help solve this problem.</span>

Any response by Israel needs to be proportionate and not lead to civilian casualties. We have on more than a dozen occasions called on both sides to exercise restraint. We call for any public demonstrations or rallies in Australia to be peaceful and not to target private businesses or individuals. The Australian government supports a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict—a solution based on the right of Israel to live in peace within secure borders and reflecting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to also live in peace— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

A range of international efforts to resolve the crisis are underway. We hope that when we wake up tomorrow morning it is to news that a ceasefire has been arrived at overnight. The government holds the view that complex foreign policy ought not to be expressed through competing parliamentary motions. The best way for the Senate to express concern for the lives of Israelis and Palestinians is through a motion supported by all senators. The best way for the Senate to express support for international efforts to resolve the crisis is through a motion supported by all senators. For these reasons, the government will introduce to the Senate a motion that acknowledges the full complexity of this crisis and support all efforts to de-escalate the conflict. It will reflect the principles I enunciated in the first part of my answer to Senator Stephens this afternoon.</span>

I refer to reports that the environment minister's decision to declare more than 2.3 million square kilometres of Australian waters as marine parks will potentially put Australia's largest aquarium supplier Cairns Marine out of business. What compensation is the government prepared to offer to the 30 people employed directly by Cairns Marine and many others directly or indirectly employed by allied businesses that are now at risk of losing their jobs as a result of the government's decision to declare the world's largest network of marine parks?</span>

The government will be providing up to $20 million to support a number of sectoral measures projects designed to assist the fishing industry to adapt to large-scale Commonwealth marine reserves. Funding will be focused on large grants of $200,000 to $2 million for projects to be delivered from 2014 to 2016. Eligibility and selection criteria for sectoral measures projects will be developed in consultation with industry organisations, fisheries managers and relevant research institutions. Entitlement buyouts will be undertaken to avoid the unsustainable concentration of commercial fishing outside of the reserve areas. The need for, and the level of, effort reduction—entitlement buyouts—will be assessed on a fishery-by-fishery basis. The relevant fisheries management agency, industry organisations and other experts will be consulted before decisions on entitlement buyouts are made. It is not surprising that, as we approach the end of what has been an extensive and lengthy process of consultation, various groups feel the need to emphasise their views through vigorous public campaigns. The sort of misleading of the Australian public that those opposite, and particularly Senator Boswell, have been engaged in is quite frankly laughable. It is simply misleading the Australian public. Petitions, rallies and email campaigns are a valid way of telling the government what people think, unless they are based on misinformation and outright lies about the government's marine reserves proposals. Some of those opposite are going very close to what I have just said.</span>

In this case, those opposite are even prepared to seek to undo a legal process that they themselves created and used when in government. Perhaps Senator Boswell did not notice. The minister and the department have consulted with Cairns Marine and will continue to do so. Those opposite should desist from misleading the Australian public.</span>

Is the minister aware that the Coral Sea marine reserve will force other commercial operators to close their doors and that AFMA cost recovery fees for the area of $270,000 will soon be borne by as few as three operators? Has the government given consideration that the increase in the financial burden for the remaining operators, who face fees potentially as high as $90,000, coupled with restricted access to the Coral Sea, will result in them simply becoming unviable and will force them to shut down?</span>

As I already indicated in an earlier answer, the government have a package, they are talking to the sector and they are working through the guidelines and the processes. We will take on board the legitimate points that Senator Boswell has raised and consider them. But, as to the conspiracy about some American organisation, if Clive Palmer were a member I could understand why you would be particularly concerned. Clive Palmer has been very clear about what he thinks of the Liberal-National Party, but do not worry: the only person in the Queensland Liberal-National Party who he thinks is a good bloke is Senator Brandis.</span>

Does the minister consider that all these groups have got it wrong?</span>

As I said in answer to Senator Macdonald, on 1 December the price the government pays for the cancer drug docetaxel will drop by 70 per cent, bringing the price the government pays into line with the market price.

If his question is, 'What are we doing to stimulate the domestic economy?' I would suggest to him that he have a look at the facts. The reality is that we have, if not the most, one of the top-performing economies in the world. Our domestic economy, despite the structural change that is occurring, is very strong. We have very low unemployment compared to any other of the comparable OECD countries or modern industrialised countries. We have strong growth. We have a pipeline of mining and other investment in this country that is at record levels. So there is a lot about the domestic economy in this country that is very, very strong. You have seen that with reduced interest rates, low unemployment and economic growth. All of those factors and all the international reports point to a very strong domestic economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that there is restructuring occurring in that economy. That is driven by the high price of the Australian dollar, and the changes that are occurring in manufacturing are being driven largely by that. But there are technological and other changes occurring in the economy that is seeing that structural adjustment, and, unfortunately, we have seen a large number of job losses in various industries.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is also true that new jobs are being created. We have record numbers of new jobs being created. People are being moved, if you like, through the way the market works into industries that are expanding, including in areas like mining and related services in our own state of Western Australia, Senator Back. On any analysis, our domestic economy is performing very well, certainly when compared to like countries, and I do not understand the suggestion that seems to be implicit in the question.</span>

Many of the struggling companies in the Industry Update Unit's report to the minister have indicated increased competition from cheap overseas imports and their own uncompetitiveness overseas in our export markets, especially Asia, as key reasons for their dire circumstances. I ask the minister: how did the government not see this coming when most credible commentators warned of its inevitability? Why did the government introduce a carbon tax, imposing a 10 per cent burden on our own companies in that circumstance?</span>

I think that is the impact of the question. We actually floated the dollar, Senator, and as I recall, at the time when there were liberals running the Liberal Party, you actually supported that. I know that you have connections with the bush, but I do not know why you suddenly have become a National. We believe that deregulating the dollar has been a good thing for this country. We think that overall it is delivering a strong economic benefit to this country. Yes, there are a range of manufacturing industries doing it tough in highly competitive environments.</span>

For the benefit of the senator, I remind him that if he reads the OECD reports, the IMF reports, the World Bank reports, they constantly provide advice that our economy is among the best performing in the world, that our unemployment is among the lowest, that our growth is among the strongest, that our economy is, I think, 11 per cent larger than it was when Labor came into office. So the sort of nonsense contained in the question has no relevance to the reality of Australia. We have a strong domestic economy but one that is in transition, that is undergoing structural change, that is buffeted by world conditions and the appreciation of the dollar. Many countries in the world would absolutely give up a lot to be in the same economic position we are. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:58</span>):  In short, the answer to the senator's question is no. The proposed consolidation of the five anti-discrimination acts into a single act will deliver clearer and simpler legislation that will be easier to understand and comply with, delivering regulatory benefits to business. The consolidated act increases certainty and reduces cost to business by addressing gaps, removing inconsistencies, reducing complexity and streamlining the complaints process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consolidated act also replaces two separate tests for discrimination with a simpler single test that is similar to what currently operates in state and territory legislation. Instead of the legalistic approach to defining discrimination in the existing acts, the consolidated law will take a principles based approach, making the law easier to understand, apply and comply with. For example, under the existing acts, defining discrimination requires the construction of a hypothetical comparator to determine whether discrimination has occurred. In the consolidated act this will be replaced by a simple definition for discrimination, incorporating unfavourable treatment based on an attribute or conduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the consolidated act, the Australian Human Rights Commission will have greater scope to dismiss unmeritorious complaints at an early stage. The new, consolidated act incorporates a shifting burden of proof, which will move from the complainant to the respondent only after a prima facie case has been established. This will limit the number of unmeritorious claims made, as complainants must first prove that a case exists before the burden of proof shifts to the respondent.</span>

Consolidating Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws into a single act will make it easier for business to find out what their obligations are and how they should comply with them. The consolidated act includes measures designed to provide certainty and assist business to understand their obligations. Certainty will be increased by the creation of a co-regulatory environment through which the commission can certify codes or other relevant standards developed by industries or businesses. If a business complies with their certified codes or standards they will have a complete defence against a complaint of discrimination. The commission will provide greater support and guidance to business in complying with the consolidated law by offering its expertise to review or audit business policy and practices. This is terrific support, and it is support that was not available previously.</span>

The simplification of anti-discrimination laws is very sensitive to the circumstance of small business and reflects other initiatives implemented by the government to support the small businesses of Australia. Small businesses, as I am sure everybody is aware, are unable to write off new assets costing less than $6,500 and the first $5,000 on the company car or ute. Incorporated businesses are now able to carry back losses so they can get a refund of up to $300,000 against tax paid in the previous year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The threats to small business confidence come in no small part from the opposition, which is doing everything it can to talk down business confidence in the face of the economic indicators. Just recently the shadow finance minister confirmed that the Liberal opposition would scrap the instant asset write-off and the loss carry-back for small business. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That in itself raises some questions, as do Senator Carr's very short, curt and, if I might say, embarrassed answers to questions raised of him today. He took the coward's way out in the first two questions simply by saying that they were not relevant to him.</span>

                  </a>  I return to the point I was making. Senator Carr's answers today showed lack of courage in any response to the questions asked of him. He took the easy way out of saying they were not related to him when, quite clearly, the question was how Senator Carr can lecture other countries about lack of corruption when it is suggested that he presided over a state government which is now being demonstrated to have been very, very corrupt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might take this opportunity while I have the floor on this issue to remind people who might be listening that while my name is Ian Macdonald and while I was some years ago a minister in the federal government, I am not the minister Ian Macdonald currently being referred to in the ICAC inquiry. Some of the allegations coming out in the ICAC inquiry—and I acknowledge that so far no-one has been convicted of anything—are such that I think the most uneducated observer would have to be concerned at the relationship between my namesake Mr Ian Macdonald, then the minister for mines, and Mr Eddie Obeid, whose family ended up with quite lucrative pieces of land following some decisions by my namesake Mr Macdonald on coal leases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why the question was asked of Senator Carr today was that the people who are featuring prominently in the ICAC inquiry were all ministers who were there when Senator Carr was the Premier of that state and the leader of the Labor Party. It was Senator Carr who promoted people like Mr Obeid and my namesake Mr Macdonald. I have to say that I met my namesake Ian Macdonald once or twice and he seemed to me to be quite a nice guy. I have to say also that I thought that about Bob Collins when he was a senator in this place and I thought that about Mr Gordon Nuttall, who I had a couple of dealings with when we were both ministers, I federally and he in the Queensland government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53369" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Di Natale:</span>
                  </a>  You're obviously not a good judge of character!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator IAN MACDONALD:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, you are quite right: I am not a good judge of character because I was quite easily fooled. Clearly, Senator Carr is also not a very good judge of character because, Senator Di Natale, Senator Bob Carr promoted these people in his government and put them in positions where the sorts of things that we read about in the paper at the present time were allowed to happen. So the question that is raised is: how can Senator Carr go round lecturing Third World countries about corruption and decency in government when those that he lectures only have to look back and see the type of government that he led?</span>

                  </a>  Mr Deputy President, I wonder if Senator Macdonald and those over on that side would be brave enough to throw those accusations at business leaders. There are some fantastic and successful business leaders who, under their regimes, run very successful companies. But if there is a change of personnel at the top and something is not right or is illegal in that business, do you go back and blame the previous general manager or the previous CEO? It is absolutely ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take offence when Senator Macdonald, who always goes the low road, revels in mud. Senator Macdonald loves to throw aspersions across the chamber at people's reputations, but he should be very careful because I remember the formative years of the Howard government when a number of ministers were removed. I do not know if you were here at the time, Senator Macdonald. I remember that when I came in you were a minister, but you did not last long—you got thrown out on your ear. That is another story, but I am happy to talk about that. It was quite hilarious, actually: the removal of Senator Macdonald with some of the incompetents on that side of the chamber. He was the only one that copped the axe between the eyes. But, Mr Deputy President, there is absolutely no credibility in throwing that. I think Senator Carr has the right to stand on his merits.</span>

I am well aware of the latitude you allow in these debates, but might I point out to you that the motion moved by Senator Macdonald was that the Senate take note of the answer given by Senator Bob Carr to the question asked of him by Senator Fierravanti-Wells. A personal attack on Senator Ian Macdonald's very distinguished record of public service does not bear in any way upon the motion before the chair.</span>

With your indulgence, Mr Deputy President, I will name a couple of the initiatives and forums that the government is heavily involved in in our region: the United Nations Convention against Corruption, ratified by Australia on 7 December 2005, and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, ratified by Australia on 27 May 2004. Foreign Minister Carr is very active in implementing these forums and initiatives. He makes a fantastic contribution and is a tremendous representative for the Australian people. Another one is the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Under the leadership of the Gallop government, the Corruption and Crime Commission was introduced in Western Australia. It does not mean that there are not a heap of frivolous cases taken there. I note that there have been a number of frivolous cases—I will say 'frivolous', because it has just tied up so much taxpayer money—where accusations have been made, people's reputations have been trashed and there have been no charges. But for the opposition to sit there in question time and try and accuse Senator Carr of being somehow engaged in inappropriate behaviour is nothing short of diabolical. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I reiterate this: if you have something to say on that side, take 30 brave steps to your right and say it outside the chamber. Senator Macdonald will not say it. He is protected in here. I still will not retract mine: he was removed as the minister, so he was not even that good then. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KROGER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  What a load of bollocks we have just heard there! In question time today, Senator Bob Carr once again sought to deflect his responsibility as Minister for Foreign Affairs—firstly when he suggested that the question in relation to corruption and upholding those standards had nothing to do with his portfolio. That clearly demonstrates what page the minister is on. In my mind, actions speak much louder than words, and no amount of the rhetorical flourishes and theatrical histrionics that we get from this foreign minister day in and day out makes a dot of difference. It does not compensate for the disgraceful cover-up that we have seen in New South Wales, and I have to say that he has not assured us of his position in relation to the abuse and the awful shenanigans that have taken place in New South Wales and that he was very much part and parcel of. The union movement are part and parcel of it, and not only have they permeated the Labor government but we know they control its agenda. In relation to the scandal and corruption that have been revealed for a long time now in New South Wales, where Labor politicians have paid and continue to pay homage to the likes of Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald—individuals that are and have been closely associated with the former Premier of New South Wales, now the foreign minister, Senator Carr—the senator's denials just do not stack up. My advice to the senator is simple, and that is that no-one believes you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hate to say, though, that the incidence of behind-the-scenes corruption in New South Wales is endemic and is linked to a wider pervasive corrupt situation across the union movement across the nation. Indeed, there are a plethora of Labor politicians here in Canberra that are here by virtue of the patronage of the union movement. In my home state of Victoria—in my patron seat of Deakin, I have to say—we have another example of this invidious patronage and the activities that they have covered up with their involvement in the union movement. The case in point is Mike Symon, the member for Deakin. When he was the Labor candidate for Deakin back in 2007, Mike Symon was a field officer for an organisation called Protect, which was described as an ETU scam which ripped off employers and channelled money into secret union trust funds.</span>

                  </a>  Thanks, Mr Deputy President. It has direct relevance because what we were seeking is an assurance that the foreign minister was complying with the principles of the convention in how he applied that on the basis of his approach domestically, here in Australia, to the international convention and international transactions. Here is yet another example of where that compliance has been neither sought nor assured. So we have a situation where we have a senator on the other side of the chamber, Gavin Marshall, who was a trustee of the ETU trust fund that channelled money away from insurance premiums that were increased by 30 per cent into a separate trust fund that Mike Symon, the then candidate for Deakin, was the bag collector for. He was the bag collector, and that is what the Labor government have supported. These people are promoted and preselected, and they sit on the opposite side of the chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cole royal commission looked into this. They do not want to deal with this, but the Cole royal commission looked into this, and I quote from it. It said, 'Unknown to the employers who contributed to the premiums in this trust fund, a private arrangement was made whereby large sums were paid by a company to the ETU as commission.' A trustee of that was one Senator Gavin Marshall, and the debt collector there was one Mike Symon. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The nature of the motion that we are debating here today goes to the heart of some of the reasons the Australian public is losing heart in its politicians because, rather than using the opportunity to discuss things that may be of real concern to people—like fallacious reports in that cheap rag the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> that try and frighten cancer sufferers all over the country—we have to use this important time in this place to not only attack the foreign minister of our country in a public forum like this but also go on to attack other individuals who have no opportunity to defend themselves against these claims.

The senator has not yet addressed any aspect of the question before the chair. She has criticised the opposition for moving the question before the chair, because she considers that other questions are more important, but she has not addressed the question before the chair.

                  </a>  Yes, fancy having to withdraw that. That was appalling. We are here to work for the good of Australia. In fact, our place on the world stage as represented by the foreign minister, Minister Carr, is one that is enviable. In 2010, from memory, we were described by the United Nations as the second best place to live in the world, and we want things to be of a high standard. Everyone on this side of this place defends the fact that we need to have strong anticorruption measures in place. Of course we do, and we totally and utterly support them. It is unfortunate that there are times when, in the interests of the greater good, these things need to be brought out into the public arena, but they do need to be exposed to the harsh light of day if any impropriety or misbehaviour is taking place. We are all in agreement about that—not to use a debate in this place which could be about things that are really relevant to the Australian people to attack the foreign minister. We have measures in place to deal with that.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The job of this place is to look at the policies that affect the Australian community. That is what the Australian people expect of us, and we, as members of government, know and expect that we should get robust criticism and forensic dissection of all the policies that we are putting into place. That is what we expect of members opposite, not trivial, small-minded, mean-spirited attacks on individuals. It disappoints me, and I am quite confident that it is a source of great disappointment to the Australian people. I am sure that all my colleagues in this place in the Greens and the Independents are disappointed that this opportunity to take note of some of the important issues that were raised today, which included cancer, the situation in Nauru— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I note, from the previous contribution made in this debate, it seems to be of some surprise to the Labor Party and the government that indeed it is the opposition's job to criticise them, albeit on topics that they might not want to be criticised on. It seems that they are upset that they do not get to choose the issues upon which they are criticised and I note that in question time Senator Lundy seemed to be disappointed and accused Senator Brandis of bringing the government into disrepute, as if somehow that was a failure on behalf of the opposition. But there is a very important reason why that question was asked and people should take note of it. It goes to both the government's and the minister's ability to effectively oversee a department and it goes to the culture of the party that makes up this government. What we are seeing in New South Wales in respect of ministers that were members of the previous Labor government is that the Independent Commission Against Corruption—established because of the corruption of the previous Labor government before that one and that saw ministers of that previous Labor government like Rex Jackson go to prison—is now doing its job a second time and exposing the underbelly of the New South Wales Labor Party to full public view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from Victoria. It seems to me I cannot remember, at least in a systemic sense, the last time a Labor minister in Victoria went to jail. Sadly, citizens of New South Wales can easily remember it in their state. We can remember when former Labor premiers of Western Australia went to prison and we can remember when former Labor ministers in Queensland went to prison, so maybe we from Victoria should be a bit upset that the worst that we can accuse the Labor Party of is incompetence! I do note, however, that there is a number of council scandals, particularly as to Brimbank, where I grew up, and that there is an investigation going on at the moment into Darebin that does involve the behaviour of Labor elected councillors. But this goes to the very culture of the Labor Party, because the culture of the Labor Party is tribal—and they brag about it. The culture of the Labor Party is so tribal that it gives them moral blindness. It gives them a moral blindness which makes those opposite unable to look at the errors and moral failures of the people on their own side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A sad point is that the previous speaker referred to the disillusionment of the people of Australia with government at the moment. She is quite right, because it is the government of the day that sets the tone—it is the government that sets the tone of political debate; it is the government that sets the tone of the political institutions—and it is this Labor government that has failed on every single test. I find it amazing that we have members of the Labor Party coming in here and complaining about personal attacks when there was nothing of the sort and there was merely a question. That is given the character assassination that happens on the other side of this building whenever the House of Representatives convenes because that is all the Labor Party can bring themselves to do. The problem with what has happened in New South Wales is that it simply does not pass the sniff test. It does not seem in any way that any reasonable person could believe that something untoward was not going on. Let us go to Geoffrey Watson, Senior Counsel, questioning Rosario Triulcio—and I hope I have pronounced that correctly. Mr Watson said:</span>

But there is a bit of a problem with mines and the Labor Party because this is not the first scandal that has happened with respect to a Labor Party minister and a mine. The first big scandal in the state of Queensland was Ted Theodore, as a former premier and with a business partner, selling a mine to the people of Queensland, so to the state of Queensland, at an inflated price without disclosing he was the owner.</span>

That moral blindness comes from their view that the means that they undertake are justified because the ends are what they deem to be appropriate and particularly what they deem to be appropriate for all the Australian people. But the truth is that the last 20 years have seen a litany of former Labor ministers being dragged before tribunals like this and a litany of some of them even going to prison.</span>

                  </a>  I am disappointed to see yesterday's announcement by the ABC General Manager, Mark Scott, of the closure of ABC production unit in Tasmania. I have repeatedly called upon Mr Scott to guarantee the production capabilities in Tasmania during a number of Senate estimates hearings. Mr Scott's answers have been deliberately evasive, and it appears that there has been a determined strategy by piecemeal removal of shows and segments to destroy ABC production capacity in Tasmania, with the aim of the complete shutdown of ABC production in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people expect that the rich stories of all Australians are told by the national broadcaster. The decision to shut down production in Tasmania is a failure to uphold one of the basic obligations of the ABC. We are a diverse nation and it is fundamental to our cultural identity that the stories of our home state are told through the ABC.</span>

                  </a>  I join with my colleagues on this, and I am sure I speak for all Tasmanian senators in the chamber—but not just Tasmanian senators; I acknowledge the fact that the minister, Senator Conroy, has asked the ABC to reconsider this position as well. I am also reminded by my colleague Senator Ludlam that, while there are resources being taken out of Tasmania at the moment with the loss of 17 jobs, it is also happening to other regional centres around Australia. We have ended up with only a couple of other locations in Australia outside Sydney and Melbourne where ABC production continues. I just want to indicate that the Greens are going to be doing everything we can to have this reversed. We have spent money with Screen Tasmania on the Goodwood facility; we have a perfect production facility in Tasmania that will be underutilised, and in the age of digital content we need the production facility in Tasmania.</span>

I had hoped this motion was not going to be contentious, except for certain extremists in this chamber who do not hold the view that Israel has the right to defend itself and live in peace without conditions. Indeed, in attempting to do this, the language of this motion is based on the Prime Minister's press release of 16 November.</span>

This is a terrorist organisation that is dedicated to the destruction of Israel, to pushing the Jews into the sea—to use its own words—and, as we have seen in the last few days, to the rampant murder and terror of its own people as well. We cannot ask another nation to do what we cannot ourselves do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We do not intend to support what is a totally one-sided motion, nor the language that Senator Ryan is using in relation to this matter. We condemn violence on both sides of the conflict, and call for not only a ceasefire but also an end to the blockade on Gaza. It is quite clear that Israel is a major military force, and Gaza is a community with a broken economy and restrictions on freedom of movement and goods. The Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-Moon, has called for an end to the blockade of Gaza. That should occur because that blockade hurts civilian populations. Australia should be supporting the two-state solution in the United Nations and the aspirations of both the Palestinian and Israeli people to live in peace and security in their own independent sovereign states.</span>

                  <a href="192970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I rise to speak on a matter of public importance—the Gillard government's plans, at the upcoming COAG meeting on 6 and 7 December to hand federal responsibility for protecting our nationally important wild places and most vulnerable species to state governments—all at the behest of big business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For people who may not know, the federal government, spurred on by the Business Council of Australia and by state governments—and backed to the hilt by Tony Abbott's opposition—is planning to hastily hand over nearly all national environmental powers to the states by using sections of our national environment laws that John Howard wrote but which even he never used.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The handover includes the abandonment of national powers on World Heritage Areas as well as threatened species to the very same states that have comprehensively failed to protect those species. The next stage of the negotiation of the handover is the COAG meeting in Canberra on 7 December and of course the Business Advisory Forum the day before, on the 6th. The government plans to negotiate the framework of the handover at this meeting and to sign over the final approvals powers to the states by next March. This represents a major threat to threatened species, to World Heritage values, to precious places and to wildlife right across the country. The Wentworth Group, major environmental NGOs and local campaign groups all acknowledge the danger this handover represents. They say—and they are right—that this is the biggest step backwards in national environmental protection in 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So 7 December is the day that this government, with the full backing of Tony Abbott's opposition, will sign off on the framework to abandon its job to protect the national environment and just leave it up to the states. That is the day that Australia's environment will be completely sold out, and sold off, to suit the mining and the business lobby, who apparently run this country. The decision to hand over environment powers to the states was a snap judgement made after a day's meeting between the ALP government and the Business Council of Australia—the day before the COAG meeting in April this year. There was no equivalent community meeting, of course. All the Business Council of Australia had to do was claim that our environment was too regulated and development was being held up. The government did not do any independent assessment of those claims; they just accepted them. They agreed to gut environmental protections and to get completely out of the way and just leave the states in charge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Comments from Minister Ferguson last week to the ABC again confirm that these changes to our environmental protections are simply being made to suit the mining and gas industries. He spoke as if environmental protection is a luxury that we can no longer afford because of the fall in commodity prices. I have no doubt that they are his genuine views, but they show that Labor is happy to turn its back on its previously held belief that the environment is of national importance, deserving national protection. Sadly, today's Labor Party is happy to trash the legacy of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who stepped in to stop the rapacious Tasmanian state government, which was going to dam the Franklin River, and who fought that all the way to the High Court. That step increased the powers of the Commonwealth like no other event since Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This same Labor government is now, with the stroke of a pen, after one day of lobbying by the BCA, winding back that role and taking environmental protection back 30 years. What a tragic backflip for Labor. And what a backflip for the Prime Minister, who, in 1999, railed against the inclusion of these delegation powers when the EPBC Act was first introduced. She described the Victorian and the other state governments as having 'a track record of environmental vandalism'. Yet, here is the Prime Minister acting on the very powers that she railed against, that John Howard had enacted but even he had not used. In 1999 Julia Gillard thought the environment was too important to hand over to the states. But, sadly, now she thinks that none of the environment is too important to hand over, except uranium mining—so she can ensure that we can ship out this toxic material to India. Even Robert Hill, John Howard's environment minister, told the Press Club in August this year that he thought Labor had gone too far with their plans to hand off environment powers to the states. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the evidence, on all indicators our environment is clearly in decline. The threatened species list has nearly tripled in the last 20 years. We are losing more and more crucial habitat and biodiversity. We have just had Professor Tim Flannery in the latest <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Essay</span> describe our current biodiversity decline as the gathering of a second extinction wave, set to empty 'vast swathes of the continent'. Our incredible Great Barrier Reef is turning into a coal and gas highway, and we have been warned that it is in danger of losing its World Heritage status. Instead of becoming a new World Heritage area, the Tarkine forests have 10 new mines planned for them. Being the state emblem of Victoria cannot save the Leadbeater's possum from being logged to extinction, even though there are now less than 1,000 of them in the wild. All of this evidence and much more that I do not have time to go into shows that our environment is suffering from far too little protection, rather than too much as the Business Council of Australia would have it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting the states in charge of the environment can only hasten this decline. Let us look at their record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Historically, states put short-term profits ahead of the environment. And because state governments are far more likely to be fixated on the short-term royalties and returns from mining and development—much of which are trumped up, I might add—there will always be that conflict of interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the big environment wins in the past have been when the federal government has stepped in and overturned a bad decision by a state government, such as oil rigs in the Great Barrier Reef or cattle in the Victorian Alps. The states simply cannot be trusted to look after our environment. The sad thing is that our national environment laws are already failing us, but, instead of making them stronger, both of the old parties are ganging up to make them even weaker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will say that they are putting standards in place to ensure that the level of environmental protection will be the same, despite the states being solely in charge. But no standard in the world can or will change the fundamental approach of state governments from prioritising mining, big business and other short-term profits ahead of environmental protection. These weak standards—and I say 'weak' because they might not even need to be reflected in state laws—might just have the status of policy, which makes me incredulous. Those weak standards will not change the states' attitude to environmental protection, and they cannot prevent states determined to approve megamines from destroying the environment. The states will simply find a way around these standards or they will deliberately flout them, as we saw recently in Queensland when the Campbell Newman government refused to comply with the assessment standards for the Alpha coal mine in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we have a federal government is to govern in the interests of all Australians on the issues that matter to all Australians. Australians everywhere care about the reef, the Tarkine, the Kimberley and our iconic koala. It remains the federal government's job to look after the most important and precious of Australia's environment assets, which are of international significance, like the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef. No standard will be able to replace the protection that is meant to be provided by the federal government for our precious places and wildlife.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ALP and the coalition will not believe that these places and wildlife are precious to all Australians. They will not step up to protect our environment from big business and other industries. They will not hesitate to sacrifice these precious places for short-term profit. Sadly, the ALP and the coalition have abandoned voters who care about the environment. With the recent revelation—and the publication of the draft standards showed this—that all environment powers, bar for uranium mining, are eligible to be handed over to the states, there is now no difference between the ALP government's and Tony Abbott's policy on the environment. Just like on refugee policy—and we have seen that again today—same-sex marriage and reducing support for single parents, there is now no difference between Labor and Tony Abbott on the environment. It is now perfectly clear that, if people believe our environment matters, their only choice is the Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our environment is under attack like never before. We cannot leave protecting Australia's environment up to the states. We can make our national environmental laws stronger, not weaker. We can keep decisions about Australia's environment in the hands of the Australian government. We can protect what we love about Australia, now and into the future. We have so much in this country that is simply too precious to lose. If Labor and the coalition will not step up to save it, it is up to all of us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="183342" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THORP</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I rise today to clarify the Gillard government's plans to cooperate with all state and territory governments to develop sound environmental policy. We must ensure that Australia's wild places and vulnerable species continue to be respected and protected against the enduring challenges they face from future development proposals by Australian businesses and, in particular, the mining industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government treats any amendment to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act very seriously. The government will always face scrutiny if it does not, particularly from those who I believe possess the strongest ecological conscience and passion to protect our environment—the Tasmanian people and the Tasmanian representatives in this place. As a proud Tasmanian, I know how fortunate I am to be surrounded by breathtaking coastlines and forests. I also know how important it is to protect the most intact and undisturbed natural areas of our land. I therefore accept and appreciate the broader concern for the protection of national wild places and vulnerable species expressed by Senator Waters on behalf of the Australian Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that we must find a balance between the continuing fight for greater environmental protection and the need to allow development to take place in order to move our nation forward. In order to prosper, Australia must maintain a stimulated economy which has the capacity to benefit all Australians, whether they are able to participate in and benefit from our economy or not. This is why protecting our environment, while ensuring that our economy continues to develop, is a clear and valued priority of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 24 August 2011, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities released the government's response to the independent review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as part of a broad package of reforms of Australia's national environment law. Announcing the reform package, the minister said that these reforms would deliver better environmental protection focusing on whole regions and ecosystems and faster environmental assessments, provide a consistent national approach to environmental impact assessments that removes duplication and cuts red tape, and provide better up-front guidance on legislation requirements, with more long-term certainty and transparency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to stimulate our economy, we must listen to the needs of Australian business—that is true. We must act to reduce barriers for business, such as removing duplicate regulation that does not need to be there. On 13 April, the Council of Australian Governments released a plan to implement forward-planning changes to federal and state environmental laws. Environmental issues have a tendency to attract emotional and irrational responses, and therefore I must clarify for those concerned the reality of the impact these changes will have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government's plan at the upcoming COAG meeting in December is to develop policy which balances these two national priorities while clarifying and enhancing the accountability of decision makers determining the outcome of development proposals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Be assured that the government has no desire to weaken or water down existing environment protections. Since it delivered its response to the Hawke review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act last year, the government has been working hard to deliver simpler environmental protection policies. The Australian federal government boasts very high environmental standards—standards of which, as a nation, we should be very proud. We know that the responsibilities shared between state and federal governments have become increasingly fluid, as policy issues that arise today were not able to be foreseen in the early 1900s, when our Federation was established.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When our federal system begins to struggle with inefficiencies due to excessive green tape, because of practices that duplicate the approval process, we must reassess existing policy and make amendments. The Hawke review identified the need for greater cooperation between the Australian, state and territory governments in delivering a better environmental law system. The review recommended using existing provisions of the EPBC Act and developing standards to enable bilateral agreements on approvals with the states and territories. The government has been working cooperatively with all states and territories to provide a basis for developing bilateral agreements that deliver a streamlined assessment and approval process based on high environmental standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government's plan to reduce green tape around approval requirements by both state and federal governments will not come at a detriment to the environment. Environmental protection is not being thrown out the window in favour of development. In fact, it is quite the opposite. All development proposals will continue to be subjected to environmental protection guidelines and policy. Each proposal will be rigorously assessed for its foreseeable and likely impacts on protected and vulnerable species as well as important wild places in Australia. The government will retain overall responsibility for protecting matters of national environmental significance and will be able to focus on setting the national environmental policy agenda, including influencing state outcomes, landscape scale and strategic approaches to environmental conservation and investment in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong assurance framework is being and will continue to be built into the bilateral agreements under discussion with states and territories. This framework will ensure that states must demonstrate how their environmental decision making is complying with national environmental standards. If states do not or will not, then the decisions will remain with the Commonwealth environment minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of these amendments is to remove regulatory duplication in order to encourage investment and increase productivity. We know that today we are living in a fast-paced world. It is therefore vital that our regulatory system be equally fast and reactive to the desires of Australian businesses. If government has the capacity to legislate to promote greater certainty for business in a time of uncertainty for our economy, then we should. If government can legislate to encourage an increase in development proposals and activities, then we should. And if government can encourage and secure investment in Australia and create more Australian jobs for the Australian people, then we should.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Gillard government who asked the COAG Business Advisory Forum what it considered to be 'nuisance regulations', and it is the Gillard government who listened. Nuisance regulations are those that are duplicated at both a state and a federal level or those which are considered to have no real purpose. Business Council of Australia president Tony Shepherd considers the goal to remove the duplicate approval process by state and federal governments to be a big step forward—a step forward that has the capacity to have a very real impact on supporting businesses that operate in Australia and assist productivity and competitiveness at a time when we are experiencing a high Australian dollar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Gillard government's plan is not to streamline environmental protection so that business and development proposals are met with the least resistance; the government's plan is to formalise an arrangement that already exists today. The Gillard government's plan will ensure that development proposals which are in keeping with environmental guidelines are able to proceed without being strangled by excessive green tape and passed back and forth between state and federal governments while investors and companies wait in uncertainty. The Gillard government has been working and will continue to work to deliver a simpler environmental protection plan—a system with clear standards, a system which allows for faster decision making and a system which ensures that our nation has both a healthy, protected environment and a strong economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 2 November the Australian government released the draft framework of standards for accreditation under the EPBC Act. These draft standards underpin the government's approach to the reform process. They recognise the need for sound assurance mechanisms to ensure that the bilateral agreements continue to operate as intended and remain responsive. The draft standards have been released to provide people with the opportunity to see the approach the government is taking as we continue to negotiate with states and territories.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must strongly affirm to the Senate that the government's plan at the upcoming COAG meeting in December is not about developing policy that will roll back our environmental protections. This December, COAG will receive an update on progress with discussion on bilateral agreements. Not one clause of existing environmental protection law is to be altered. The government's plan is simply concerned with removing unnecessarily duplicative and time-consuming processes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  I am pleased to participate in this debate on this matter of public importance and bring a sense of reality and common sense to an issue that has been concerning Australians for a long time. I will say at the outset that I was pleased to hear the rhetoric from the previous speaker, Senator Thorp, from the government benches. If only that rhetoric were moved into reality, then I would have to say that it would be perhaps one thing on which I agreed with the Labor government. I will give some credit to the Labor government—and this is a rare thing for me to do. I have to say, as the Howard government we did try to bring together the state and federal environment rules so that there was one assessment process. Unfortunately, we had not achieved that at the time we left government. So I am pleased that at least the Labor Party is paying the rhetoric. I am delighted that at COAG the federal government will be meeting with a series of what are now sensibly governed states who have a real interest in the environment but also a real interest in reducing red and green tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am always proud to come to debates on the environment by reminding the parliament that every serious environmental measure for the betterment of Australia has been introduced by Liberal governments. The first ever minister for the environment came from a Liberal government. When you go back through history and look, for example, at the Great Barrier Reef and Fraser Island, you see that most of the serious environmental advancements, such as the EPBC Act, were made under Liberal governments. As I always said to my good friend Robert Hill, who introduced the EPBC Act, it is an act that is good in the hands of a sensible, responsible, reasonable and balanced minister, but if you put it in the hands of someone like Tony Burke you have real problems—and haven't my predictions turned out to be true. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the Labor Party's decisions on the environment are dependent on whether they will retain the support of the Greens in the lower house, where they need that one vote for Ms Gillard to remain as Prime Minister, with all the power that the Prime Minister exercises. You will recall that, before the last election, in the greatest rebuff to the voters' trust in the Australian political system, Ms Gillard promised solemnly never to introduce a carbon tax under the government she led. It is no wonder now that Australians simply do not believe anything our current Prime Minister says.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to where I started my contribution. The Liberal and National parties are the parties in the Australian political system that have been the cause of every serious environmental advancement in this country. Once upon a time we had the best managed sustainable forests. That meant that the forestry companies went through and cleared the undergrowth and the fuel. They had tracks through every forest. On site, they had not only capable men and women but also resources to put out any fire that started. The Greens came along and shut down forestry, shut down these tracks and shut down employment opportunities. More importantly, they shut down those people who could address wildfires as they started. As Senator Williams often says, the Black Saturday fires in Victoria occurred because of the huge fuel build-up in the national parks. Fifty per cent of the fires on Black Saturday came from national parks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens and the Labor Party love setting up national parks but they never put any money into them; they never put any money into properly managing them. They have become havens for feral animals, weeds and fuel that is tinder dry and ready to explode. I understand more damage has been done to Australia's biodiversity by these wildfires, which happened because the Greens will not let any fuel be removed from our native or other forests—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator IAN MACDONALD:</span>
                  </a>  You only need five tonnes per hectare of fuel, a 40-degree day and a 50-kilometre wind and a fire becomes uncontrollable. And talk about the koalas—what koalas are left after those sorts of wildfires? It is you, the Greens political party, that cause the death of so many koalas and of so much else of our very special biodiversity that makes Australia great. And you want to blame someone—and I do; I point to the corner where the Greens sit with all their misguided logic on the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far be it from me to support the Labor Party on this, but giving environmental control to one authority, using the environmental laws of both the Commonwealth and a particular state, is a marvellous thing to do. I can give you any number of examples, and I will give you just a few. There is a cassava farm up in Home Hill, near where I live. They spent literally millions of dollars to get state government approval. Everything is ready to go. Once the state government has given its approval, they have to then try and get this lot that presently control the government in Canberra to go and oversee it and do exactly the same thing that the state government—in this case, a Labor state government—had already done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another instance up where I come from, with the Guthalungra prawn farm. Do not hold me to the figures, but they are close enough to be accurate. The proponents spent something like $10 million getting state government approval for the farm. Having gone through the most stringent process, they then come down to Canberra and have this idiot mob here—who are held in office by the Greens and therefore susceptible to every whim of the Greens—put a whole new set of assessments, delays, costs and conditions on them. They get to $20 million to introduce a prawn farm that provides food not only for Australia but for the starving millions around the world that the Greens pretend on occasion they are concerned about. This green tape, this duplication, stops the production of food in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens hate dams. The Labor Party, being as gutless as they are, also hate dams because they need the Greens support to keep this government in power or to get preferences. We have this Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce which, in its original configuration, under Senator Heffernan, looked at dams. The government changed and the membership of that committee changed. They brought out a report and, when they were challenged about how weak it was, said, 'Oh, we were told by the government we could not look at dams.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This shows how neither the Greens nor the Labor Party have the courage to look at the real issues confronting Australia. Sure, animals are important, and if these parties believed they were important they would do something about the fuel loads in the forests so that the koalas would not be killed. That is why we are losing our koalas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Greens do not seem to worry about people—they do not seem to worry about Australians who need jobs or about people around the world who are starving and need Australia's food. The Greens are not interested in people; all they talk about is biodiversity, and they are really the cause of the destruction of most of Australia's biodiversity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, time is not going to allow me to make a lot of the other points that I wanted to make. But I say to the Labor government that the rhetoric on getting a streamlined approach to environmental assessments is good. It does not mean reducing your standards, and it does not mean ignoring any Commonwealth or state environmental law. It means getting a better process and getting rid of an enormous amount of green tape and having not only the science and the environment but also development jobs and—most importantly—food as well.</span>

The clearing of our native vegetation, which everyone recognises as one of the major causes of the loss of biodiversity, and feral and introduced animals, which everyone recognises as another of the major causes of loss of biodiversity, are suddenly not the real causes of the loss of biodiversity. Australia has the highest rate on the planet of pneumonia and decline in critical weight range of native animals, but it seems to be okay with both the coalition and the government that we water down our federal environmental laws. It horrifies me to hear Senator Thorp and the government continue to use the industry rhetoric of 'green tape'. Nothing demonstrates more clearly that the government have bowed down to industry and the miners than their adoption of the rhetoric of 'green tape'. When they say 'green tape', they mean environmental laws that are put in place to protect our environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely essential that we have strong federal environmental laws. In my home state of Western Australia the importance of having such laws is nowhere more evident than in the state government's granting of environmental approval just this week for the development of James Price Point in the Kimberley on the basis of an extremely flawed environmental assessment process. In Western Australia we could not find five independent environmental specialists with the expertise to be able to make an assessment on the development project for James Price Point. Four of the EPA members had to excuse themselves because they had a conflict of interest. Nothing speaks more plainly of the fact that we need strong federal environmental laws. If a state cannot find five independent people to do an environmental assessment, at least the Commonwealth can take a much more independent view in looking at development proposals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the environmental assessment process that was carried out in Western Australia and the environmental impact assessment statement that the proponents put up. It is riddled with errors, mistakes and flaws—riddled with them. The proponents did not seem to be able to count the number of whales that use the James Price Point area. They did not seem to be able to recognise—though, if they had read some of the scientific literature and done proper surveys, they would have recognised it—that the James Price Point area is one of the most important whale nurseries in the world. They only seemed to be able to see the humpback whales, not the other whales which use the area. They did not recognise the fact that there are at least four different types of dolphins in the area. They failed to find the miniature spinner dolphin, and they did not properly address the issues around the snub-nosed dolphin. They did not find turtle nesting sites near the James Price Point development site. Could that have been because they apparently carried out the survey in the non-nesting time? They did not find the bilbies using the terrestrial area. They downplayed the importance of the vine thickets in the area. They did not do the proper research on the importance of the dinosaur trackways in the area. The conditions on the protection of the dinosaur footprints are laughable, and they did not consider the interruption to the songlines associated with the footprints.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />There were all these flaws, and I have not even touched on the issues around the importance of the area for dugongs and the fact that the proponents totally underestimated the impact of the development on dugongs due to the loss of sea grasses. They have not dealt with the fact that the development will move millions of tonnes of dredging materials or the impact that this will have not only on coastal processes but also on feeding grounds for turtles down at Quandong Point. Turtles there are already under pressure from the Gorgon development, which is occurring on one of the most important sites for endangered species on the planet—Barrow Island—on which, because it is an island, endangered species can be protected. All these flaws demonstrate both the 'development at all costs' approach taken in Western Australia—in the Burrup, we have lost priceless Aboriginal heritage—and the need for strong environmental protection laws at the federal level. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am proud to do so as part of the Labor government, which deeply believes in protecting the environment. To demonstrate this fact we only need to look at the scorecard of our latest achievements on the environment. Just last week Minister Burke announced a two-year ban on the supertrawler to allow an expert committee to assess the environmental impacts of large-scale fishing. Earlier this month Minister Burke announced that the government would recognise the Indigenous national heritage values of the Wet Tropics of Queensland in the existing Wet Tropics of Queensland National Heritage Listing. The Wet Tropics of Queensland were added to the National Heritage list in 2007. The Chair of the Australian Heritage Council, Professor Carmen Lawrence, said that she was delighted that the Indigenous heritage of the Wet Tropics had been included. She said:</span>

Based on my experience with Indigenous elders up on the cape—I have conversed with the likes of David Claudie about that area and heard what he considers important for Indigenous people on the cape—I have to concur with Professor Carmen Lawrence's view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the minister announced the marine bioregional plan. We have the third largest marine area in the world with a $44 billion marine economy. The plan will ensure we protect this beautiful asset and that future generations can experience a healthy marine environment. However, on 16 November Campbell Newman's Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. John McVeigh, said that the plan 'will destroy Queensland jobs and local businesses'. That is consistent with the rhetoric we have heard within the chamber today on this subject. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The impact across our fishing communities will be enormous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These claims need to be disputed. I cannot work out why Campbell Newman's government hates the ocean so much. They argue about protecting the reef and now they are opposed to national parks in the ocean. From these comments, you can only assume they are opposed to their own buyouts, the ones they announced two days ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The no-fishing zones are many hundreds of kilometres off the Queensland coast. They are areas which most recreational fishers would never reach in a lifetime of angling. The Newman government's comments are extreme, bizarre and wrong. It would certainly take an effort worthy of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guinness Book of Records</span> for someone to cast a line from the coast to reach the Queensland exclusion zone, which is 300 kilometres out to sea. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget the climate change policy this government implemented, a policy which was supported by the Greens in the end—after they had initially embarrassed themselves by voting with the Liberals and Nationals to oppose this important legislation to protect our environment. So do not come in here and make sanctimonious comments about our party being lukewarm on the environment and compare our policies to Mr Abbott's environmental policies. You are way off the track there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really amazed to hear Senator Macdonald's contribution—his comment about Labor state governments not putting money into national parks. Just recently there was an announcement about jobs in the environment and national park areas of the Queensland government being terminated. How are they going to put money into national parks in Queensland if they are sacking workers—14,000 or more? And they are talking about us having no commitment to national parks. It is an absolute joke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will move on to what we are doing as a result of what came out of the April 2012 COAG meeting. We are going to prioritise the development of bilateral agreements, with frameworks and standards to be developed by December 2012. Those bilateral agreements are to be finalised by March 2013. In December, COAG will receive an update on the progress of discussions on bilateral agreements. Negotiating bilateral agreements is not about rolling back environmental protections; it is about reducing unnecessary duplication and time-consuming processes while lifting the states up to provide the same level of environmental protection currently provided by the Commonwealth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some respects, I have some empathy for the views embodied in this motion. I accept the point that Senator Waters makes about having concerns about the current Queensland government and their commitment to the environment and to national parks. In doing so, I refer to an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier-Mail</span>—not always a paper you can rely upon, but in this case I will. The article is headed 'Newman government plan to open national park areas to logging and grazing'. It says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Newly allocated national parks could be reopened to commercial logging and grazing under controversial Newman Government plans to revive the state's struggling agricultural industries.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, national parks minister Steve Dickson—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">told The Courier-Mail about 875,000 ha of state forest and former cattle stations recently gazetted as national parks were likely to be the first to be rescinded.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That certainly is a concern. I am personally concerned about that, given the beauty of my state of Queensland and of the many national parks I have been fortunate enough to be able to visit, to take my family along to and to camp in and enjoy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing we are going to do through COAG is to bring the states into line with us—to make sure they are involved and on-board in accepting their responsibility to protect the environment. We will retain overall responsibility for providing protection on matters of national environmental significance. The aim is to focus on setting the national environmental policy agenda, including influencing the state outcomes, and landscape scale and strategic approaches to environmental conservation and investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong insurance framework is being built into the bilateral agreements under discussion with the states and territories. If they do not or will not accept their responsibilities, environmental decisions will remain with the Commonwealth and the environment minister. That is the relevant point here—it is about having the overall responsibility. If the states will not comply, it comes back to the Commonwealth and to the environment minister. That is consistent with my opening remarks, which clearly demonstrated this government's commitment to the environment. Our commitment is undisputed. No-one can come in here this afternoon and have a go at this government about our commitment when it comes to the environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note, I have on many occasions been fortunate enough to travel to the cape to see firsthand some of the areas which need protection. There was a debate in this chamber, before Senator Waters and some of the other Greens came into this place, about a bill to prevent mining on the Wenlock River, that beautiful pristine river.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wenlock River owes its existence and ongoing sustainability to several perched bauxite springs, which not only supply the river but also provide habitat for rare fauna and flora. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the areas that we need to ensure are protected, especially when you have a Liberal National Party state government like we have in Queensland considering opening mines in the cape hundreds of kilometres in size. They would cause enormous environmental vandalism to the likes of the Wenlock River. This is why we need to make sure, when we are having debates and discussions with state governments, regardless of whether they be Labor or Liberal National Party, that they are on the same path as us. Hopefully I will have an opportunity once again to go up there and enjoy beautiful environmental areas like the Wenlock. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  This matter of public importance has been nominated by the Australian Greens. When we look at matters of public importance sometimes we need to look at their tone at the very outset, before we get into the detail. Today we are discussing the Gillard government's plans, at the upcoming COAG meeting on 6 and 7 December, to hand federal responsibility for protecting our nationally important wild places and most vulnerable species to state governments at the behest of big business. So it is evil big business that the Australian Greens would like us to focus the debate on—the pejorative term 'big business' is thrown in there at the end, that little swipe saying that anything business may want must be bad. That is not the case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far be it from me to have to stand here in this place and defend actions that the Gillard government may be taking, but equally there must be credit, to some degree, where it is due. In this case credit is due because the Gillard government is trying to work through the processes that exist within the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to facilitate arrangements where the states might be able to streamline some of these environmental approval processes. The coalition has a very clear standard about streamlining—we understand it is one that the government is seeking to apply as well—and that is that current environmental standards should be maintained. This should not be about stripping away standards, but it should be about improving efficiency—removing the costs and the complexity that all too often in Australia mean far too many developments face multilayered approvals processes that see cost and time and delays and uncertainty and hassles for investors mount as they try to get local government approvals, state government approvals and federal government approvals for development proposals. We think it makes sense to move towards something that is more streamlined but that maintains a core level of standards. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government was proud of its achievement in introducing the EPBC Act. My predecessor as a senator for South Australia, Robert Hill, was the environment minister at the time, and he would cite it as one of his great accomplishments—and so he should, because the act does provide some national standards for environmental protection. Those national standards should be maintained. But they should not be maintained as standards alongside the maintenance of some fake belief that it must all be done by the federal government in a bureaucratic and administrative sense—if the capacity is there, as the act provides for, for states to undertake some of these assessments in conjunction with their own assessment processes, then that is a perfectly sensible step to take as long as standards are maintained.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has identified very clearly that red tape and so-called green tape is a mounting problem for development in this country. The more investors see that it is going to take a long time and a lot of hassle and cost to get approvals, the more likely they are to think it is easier to go and do business elsewhere. If we can reduce the time involved, if we can reduce the layers of government they have to deal with, if we can reduce the complexity and if we can reduce the cost, we will maximise the chance of investors deciding that Australia is the right place to do business and bring their dollars to. That is what we should all want. That is why the Leader of the Opposition announced earlier this year coalition policy for a one-stop shop for environmental approvals, coalition policy that will seek to ensure that the states and territories can opt into administering a single approvals process under the Commonwealth EPBC Act for major projects so that there is a capacity for those dual assessments to be undertaken covering Commonwealth and state requirements at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, we say that if the states would rather have the Commonwealth as a sole designated assessor we are willing to work through that process as well. So, from the coalition's perspective, our desire is not to be prescriptive about saying the states should do all of it or the Commonwealth should do all of it, but we should try to reach an outcome where you do not have both levels of government applying the bureaucracy and doing the assessments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the single assessment process, we would also seek to create, working with the states, single lodgement and documentation processes for environmental appointments, once again seeking to reduce and minimise the paperwork, the green tape, the cost and complexity that comes with getting developments off the ground. We think that by offering this as an option to the states, rather than simply handing it over, we also create the capacity for some competition between the states. I happen to be someone who believes that if we are going to stick with this model of a federation then we should put the states to some work: give the states the capacity to compete against each other to see who can be the most efficient and effective at doing their job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, I stress that that does not mean that you undermine the Commonwealth environmental standards through that process. We would expect there to be, and would ensure that there is, strict application of those Commonwealth environmental standards. The option, as I said, would be before states and territories to have the Commonwealth designated as a sole assessor instead, if that were a preference. But the priority is to make sure we shift to a situation where there are not multiple layers of bureaucracy undertaking different assessments at great cost and great complexity to those seeking development approval.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Waters highlights arrangements that may exist, and yet Senator Waters and the Greens seem to have this enormous problem and concern with the idea that those existing arrangements could be built upon and improved. With existing bilaterals in place, why can they not be built upon and improved? Why can we not work to an ambition of a one-stop shop? I hope that is what the government seek to do through the upcoming COAG meeting and through their work in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not afraid of the fact that big business might be advocating this. Governments should be able to respond to all stakeholders and all interests, including the so-called 'big business' in the Greens' motion. Respond to them, of course, knowing that they come with their own vested interests. And you need always to act with your eyes open to the vested interests of whomever is knocking on your door. But that does not mean that you reject all of their points and their views outright. You accept what makes sense and you apply the other necessary tests to them. In this case, what makes sense is to reduce the bureaucracy and to achieve a one-stop shop approach but to do so whilst maintaining your Commonwealth environmental standards as the minimum test through these processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So if the coalition win the next election we will certainly work through the type of process that I have outlined today and that Mr Abbott announced back in April of this year as coalition policy. If the government at the December COAG meeting is able to work through something similar, then we will welcome that. We will welcome anything where this government actually reduces the red tape and green tape that are clogging so much of business in this country at present. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Does that not tell you exactly where the government and coalition are coming from in this effort that is underway, driven by the Business Council of Australia? What has been put to COAG came straight from the Business Council of Australia; it is almost the exact language that they put forward. Let us not pretend that the whole purpose here is not anything other than, as Senator Birmingham just talked about, getting development off the ground and, as the government says, streamlining—and read for 'streamlining' 'fast-tracking'. That is what we are talking about here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, those of us in the environment movement around the country, that when you hear the word 'streamlining' it means 'fast-tracking'. Anyone who wants to know what that means should just look at the pulp mill process in Tasmania, where we had so-called 'streamlining'. The then Premier of Tasmania, Paul Lennon, took the pulp mill out of the agreed assessment process because Gunns said that it did not suit them. They knew that they would not pass that process. It was taken out, and what did the Commonwealth do? Did it declare the whole thing null and void? Not on your life! Where is the compliance and enforcement? Tasmanians were put through years and years of division in the state and complete nonsense out of the state government in its assessment of the impacts on the marine environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Commonwealth which at least came to the rescue on the marine environment, to actually have the capacity to look at genuine impacts. If it had been left up to the Tasmanian government, it would have been the pulp mill task force and the ridiculous claims by the pulp mill task force that there would be a level of dispersion and dilution of the effluent into Bass Strait. The reason they gave for that—and I will never forget the interview from the pulp mill task force—was that a dinghy that came off a fishing boat washed up on Flinders Island, and that proved that there was a sufficient current to get rid of effluent into Bass Strait.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the kind of nonsense you get if you rely on state governments. The fact is that, right around the country, environment departments in state governments have been so hollowed out that there is hardly any expertise left. Anyone who thinks that a state government would ask the Commonwealth to assess one of their projects that they want to be fast-tracked as a project of state significance, just get real. The whole point here is that they want to fast-track it for themselves and take away any kind of environmental protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is where we are with the Tarkine in Tasmania. I know that my colleagues have talked about James Price Point and that they have talked about threatened species and so on around the country. I particularly want to talk about the Tarkine, where you have the Tasmanian Premier totally opposed to the National Heritage listing of the Tarkine, in spite of the fact that the Heritage Council recommended that 434,000 hectares be listed because it contained 'extensive, high-quality wilderness' and because 'largely undisturbed tracts of cool temperate rainforest are extremely rare worldwide'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from the Heritage Council. But what do we have? We have the Tasmanian Premier and Deputy Premier saying that there is no way the state government would compromise Tasmania's mining potential, including heavily mineralised areas on the north-west and west coasts, and so they want all of those mine proposals in the Tarkine to proceed. And who would think for a single minute that if the assessment of the Tarkine were handed over to the Tasmanian government there would be anything like what the Heritage Council has recommended to the minister be protected?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the situation we now have. We have it at James Price Point, where the Premier of Western Australia wants the Kimberley opened up for development and wants it to come out of James Price Point. We see exactly the same thing in Victoria with the logging of the habitat of the Leadbeater's possum and in New South Wales with the koala, and elsewhere around the country. And of course there is the Great Barrier Reef, not to mention the Coorong and of course Kangaroo Island in South Australia. We are seeing it right around the country. The whole point here is that Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, is going to abandon the legacy of the Hawke government, abandon that for Labor and give it away in order to please the Business Council of Australia and to fast-track the extinction of species. That is what this will do: fast-track the extinction of species and the loss of Australia's environmental values around the country and the fabulous habitats and places people love. It is a case of Labor and the coalition getting together to abandon 30 years of environmental protection for destruction, and that is a disgrace. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a motion for the disallowance of Migration Amendment Regulation 2012 (No. 6) as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2012 No. 237 and made under the Migration Act 1958. The regulation was tabled on 29 October 2012. The government claims that the purpose of the regulation is as follows: to amend the Migration Regulations 1994 to prescribe a new class of persons as eligible noncitizens under paragraph 72(1)(b) of the Migration Act. That class of persons is a noncitizen who, when he or she last entered Australia, was not immigration cleared and after entering Australia was granted a bridging E (class WE) visa under section 195 of the act. As eligible noncitizens, persons in this class of persons are able to make valid applications for bridging visas in Australia subject to any other provisions in the act or the principal regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulation will allow irregular maritime arrivals who have already a bridging visa granted by the minister under section 195A of the Migration Act to make a further application for a bridging visa when that initial bridging visa expires and have that visa granted where they have been unable to do so in the past. This regulation is no doubt being introduced by the government because of its failed border protection policies and because these failed policies have seen the number of IMAs arriving in Australia in this financial year increase to three times the rate of arrivals in the previous financial year, and as a result Australia's immigration detention network can no longer cope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As confirmation of that, I refer to an article on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> website entitled 'Labor's Pacific Solution overwhelmed', which was published about 40 minutes ago. The first paragraph of that article says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Immigration Minister Chris Bowen has effectively conceded that Labor’s Pacific Solution Mark II has been overwhelmed, announcing that asylum seekers are arriving in such numbers that they will be allowed to live in the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has admitted to the Australian people and to this parliament that the total number of IMAs in immigration detention centres and APODs is 7,670. There are 1,688 under residence determination, and more than 6,100 IMAs have been released on bridging visas since November 2011. The government therefore wants this regulation passed so that it can release the IMAs, as Minister Bowen has stated today—and only very recently—into the community as a matter of urgency so that the government can make way for the new IMAs that are arriving at an unprecedented rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If one distils the effect and the impact of this regulation, it is clear that it is in fact a declaration of abject failure and incompetence by the minister and by the Gillard Labor government. This regulation is a declaration by the minister and the government that Labor's border protection policies have comprehensively failed and that the people smugglers have won their right to decide who will be able to enter Australia and under what terms they will be able to do so. This regulation enables the people smugglers to continue to ply their criminal trade. They know that the more people they send to Australia, and the more pressure they put on a Labor government, the more likely it is that the government will make changes to the immigration regulations to accommodate the people smugglers' vile trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the scope of this regulation is so broad, representing such a decisive win for the people smugglers, that I expect that they will be photocopying this regulation and using it as a marketing ploy to show people that under Labor they actually determine who comes and the manner in which they come to Australia. People smugglers will probably laminate copies of this regulation and hand it out to IMAs, telling them that it shows that the minute they get to Christmas Island they are basically guaranteed a free passage to Australia, because that is what this regulation actually does. It has the effect of creating yet another avenue of judicial review for IMAs which they previously, prior to this regulation, did not have. One has to remember that judicial review is a great cost to the Australian taxpayer. It is the Australian taxpayer who pays for judicial review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulation is also dangerous in that it clearly sends a signal to people smugglers that under the current Labor government, despite the spurious threat of offshore processing, once an IMA has been delivered to Australia they are effectively here for good. It represents a dramatic extension to the minister's announcement in November 2011 that he would allow IMAs to be released into the community on bridging visas prior to their applications being finalised and after initial checks had been completed. That November 2011 policy reversal was clearly designed to relieve pressure on the detention network, which had been straining under the increasing arrivals. The coalition was very critical of the announcement at the time, and the shadow minister for immigration, Scott Morrison, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Failed asylum seekers who arrive by boat will now be able to stay in Australia for years to pursue their claims through the Refugee Review Tribunal and endlessly in the courts, with broader grounds of appeal, while living and working in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… A Government who claims to want to provide a deterrent on boat arrivals would never do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators will also be aware that sovereign governments have the right to determine who comes to their country and the manner and circumstances in which they do so. Most countries have migration acts which set out the terms and conditions of entry to ensure that the country's sovereign right is not in any way compromised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia the Migration Act 1958 is the statutory instrument that sets out the terms and conditions on which a person is allowed to enter Australia. Section 195A of the Migration Act provides the minister personal authority to grant a detainee a visa, whether or not on application, subject to the minister making his personal decision after considering the specific circumstances of the detained person. Section 195A of the Migration Act is couched in terms that, as set out in subsection (2), specifically require the minister to personally consider the facts before he or she makes a personal decision on the granting of a section 195A visa. The requirement of the personal decision was written into the Migration Act because the parliament in its wisdom determined that it was critical that a person who is directly accountable to the parliament exercises Australia's sovereign right to determine who will enter this country. Parliament was clear in its intent to ensure that such a decision was made by a minister because that minister could potentially be challenged on the floor of the parliament to explain his or her decision to the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament also included a requirement, in section 195A(6), that the minister table his or her reasons for such a grant before each house of the parliament. This requirement for the minister to table their reasons for the exercise of their personal power was another safeguard that the parliament saw as critical to the process under the grant of a visa under section 195A of the Migration Act. Given the provisions of section 195A, the parliament further determined that the exercise of the minister's personal decision-making power was to be beyond the power of the courts to intervene in and that such decisions would be non-compellable and non-reviewable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators should be aware that the regulations we are currently debating provide for the express requirements in section 195A to make the minister personally accountable for his actions to the parliament to be overridden and set aside and for the personal power of the minister to be delegated to a public servant. Further, there is no requirement to table any reasons for the public servant's decision in the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I quote from attachment B, which forms part of the explanatory memorandum to the relevant regulation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This change will enable a delegate of the Minister in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to decide subsequent visa applications for this cohort without requiring the Minister to consider using his personal power under section 195A. If a delegate of the Minister were to decide to grant a visa, the Minister would not be required to cause to be laid before each House of Parliament a statement under section 195A setting out the reasons for granting the visa for each subsequent grant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition says this to Minister Bowen: by the Migration Act, you, as the relevant minister, are required to lawfully exercise the powers that the parliament has conferred upon you in the manner set out in the appropriate statute. You are not at liberty, nor do you possess the power, to delegate your personal statutory obligations to others. If you do not want to exercise the powers the parliament has given you then, quite frankly, you should hand in your resignation. A minister should not abrogate a personal duty for which he is personally accountable to the parliament in this way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister needs to understand that, unless the parliament agrees that the minister should be able to abrogate his personal duties to the parliament, such a regulation is incompetent. The change represents a dramatic reversal of the accountability of the minister to the parliament, as is currently required by section 195A, and effectively extinguishes by regulation the statutory obligations of the minister when using his personal decision-making power, as set out in section 195A. In fact, I would be keen to hear the minister's explanation. Perhaps Minister Ludwig, if he chooses to address this motion, can provide the explanation to us of why the minister sought to gazette a regulation in an attempt to relieve the minister of various statutory obligations, rather than to come into the parliament and amend the principal act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of this regulation, if it is supported, is to enable visas to be granted, without the need for an application, at the discretion of public servants who will not be accountable to the parliament. This is directly in opposition to what is currently required by the Migration Act. I say 'not accountable to the parliament' because any issue affecting the discretionary exercise of this power by a public servant will be reviewable by the courts; it will not be an issue for the parliament. That is completely at odds with the minister's current responsibilities under section 195A of the Migration Act. This regulation effectively outsources to public servants the statutory obligations of ministerial decision making in the vital area of the discretionary grant of visas to IMAs and, quite frankly, is a gross abrogation of ministerial responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is appalled that the government and the Greens would seek to sell out the parliament for crass political purposes. It is also extremely concerning to the coalition that, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, no consultation outside the Department of Immigration and Citizenship was undertaken in the preparation of the measure in this regulation because it was required urgently. Surely the parliament is entitled to a comprehensive explanation of why there is an urgent need for a regulation that (a) seeks to override the express words of the Migration Act 1958 and purports to divest the minister of his express statutory obligations; (b) abrogates the personal decision-making power of the minister to public servants, who were not elected by the people, merely appointed by the government of the day; and (c) establishes a further avenue of appeal through judicial review of the decisions of public servants for people who arrive here unlawfully by boat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This regulation also raises a number of very important issues that have not been addressed by the government—again, perhaps Minister Ludwig would be kind enough to address these issues if he chooses to address the chamber—but that could have very serious consequences in this important portfolio area. These issues include: what is the effect of this regulation on those persons who are subject to the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012, remembering that that amendment provided the minister with the discretion to determine that a person does not have to be taken to a regional processing country? Others issues it raises include an explanation of what criteria or conditions will prevent the bridging visa being granted by the public servant and an explanation of what criteria or conditions must be considered by the public servant prior to the granting of a bridging visa. Can the public servant actually refuse the grant of a bridging visa and, if so, why is the regulation expressed in terms of 'apply for and be given'? That is the current wording of that regulation: apply for and be given. What is the process undertaken prior to the granting of a bridging visa, or is this process merely an automatic rubber-stamp by a public servant once an application for a bridging visa is made? That therefore confirms exactly what the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> is currently saying in its article online, which is basically that asylum seekers are effectively here for good and allowed to live in the Australian community. Further, is the public servant able to grant a bridging visa to any person who arrived in Australia's excised offshore territory on or after 13 August 2012 and, if so, who?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that, for once, the press in their analysis have actually got it right. Minister Bowen, in making his further announcement today, has conceded that the detention network in Australia is now basically overwhelmed. This regulation shows that the government is desperate to keep as many people as possible out of detention as the cost pressures on the detention network escalate unsustainably. Perhaps this is the sole reason for the government bringing in this measure, because it will allow every IMA who has a BVE from the minister to apply for a bridging visa after that initial visa expires and have it granted by a public servant without reference back to the minister. A further visa will be granted automatically, subject to other provisions in the acts and regulations. However, every refusal of an application will open the door for endless appeals through the tribunals and eventually the courts, and it must be remembered that this will all be paid for by the Australian taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulation effectively allows, and in most cases will likely force, the government and the minister to keep IMAs on bridging visas indefinitely. This is nothing more and nothing less than bad public policy, and it is clearly not in the national interest when it is completely at odds with the express provisions of section 195A of the Migration Act, which make this a personal statutory responsibility of the minister—a responsibility about which, by this regulation, the minister is throwing his hands up and saying to the Australian people, 'I cannot cope anymore, and because I cannot cope I am delegating my decision-making power under section 195A to public servants who are not accountable to the parliament.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, by this regulation the government is saying to the people smugglers and the people of Australia that mandatory detention is effectively over under the Gillard Labor government. By a stroke of the pen and with the introduction of this regulation, the government has removed any incentive at all for an IMA to return home. This is yet another step by the Labor government that will damage the integrity of our migration program. It is not in the interests of good governance and the proper exercise of ministerial responsibility. In the interests of good governance and in the interests of ministerial responsibility, this regulation should be disallowed.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDWIG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  If I can just inject some facts into this debate, I know that Senator Cash has made a range of unsubstantiated statements and claims about the regulation. I did listen intently to it. I was wondering at one point whether we were talking about the same regulation. I came to the conclusion that we were not. Be that as it may, can I say that much of the hyperbole that Senator Cash went to about what the regulation will or will not do is erroneous; I leave it at that. I can try to explain what the regulation does do and let people who listen to this make up their own minds about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the regulation does is to reduce an unnecessary logistical and administrative burden on the Department of Immigration and Citizenship by allowing the department to manage irregular maritime arrivals in line with normal status resolution procedures—nothing more and nothing less. Previously the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship would use his personal non-compellable power under section 195A of the Migration Act to grant a bridging visa to an IMA for a specified time to release them from immigration detention while their claims for protection were being considered. However, as this power is available only if a person is in immigration detention as an unlawful noncitizen, when a person's bridging visa ceases—if you follow me to that point—what happens is that they have to be detained. They have to be gone after, got and put back in detention before they can be granted a new bridging visa. So the minister, under 195A, releases them for a specified time whilst their claims for protection are being considered—so they have already gone through their health, identity and security checks—and they are simply at one point of many on a positive pathway. But in this instance, when the time is finalised, they have to be detained and the minister, in this instance, has to reissue a new bridging visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These regulations enable the department to grant subsequent bridging visas to people for whom the minister has already personally granted a bridging visa prior to the expiry of their original visa, meaning that they do not have to be unnecessarily redetained and reducing the burden on both the department and the individual. This also enables the department to more effectively manage people within normal status resolution procedures, allowing appropriate conditions to be applied to bridging visas to encourage voluntary removal from Australia where a person has been found not to be a refugee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following on from the regulation itself, if it is disallowed then you will not have all of the issues that Senator Cash raised occurring, because they are fanciful. What you will have is that hundreds of people currently on bridging visas will need to be redetained in order to have their bridging visas renewed, at a significant inconvenience for the client. And for what purpose? Many of these people are already on a positive pathway, and there is an administrative burden in redetaining them when they have already had a health check and a security check, their application is currently being assessed and the minister has made the initial decision to put them on a bridging visa for a specified time. So all of that has already been undertaken. In many cases, redetaining can take several hours and require people who have found employment to take the day off work, and any children to take the day off school, simply to have their visa renewed. You wonder why Senator Cash would want to intervene in such a forceful manner, stop people from continuing their employment and continuing to manage their family and their children, and make them go through this hoop again—other than that perhaps she might enjoy having them go through an administrative hoop twice. I do not think that is true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis I think that what has happened here—and it sometimes does happen—is that you read a conspiracy theory into a regulation and after a while it becomes truer the more times you read it. Can I again simply dispel that. Many of the allegations made (1) are completely unfathomable to me, (2) are wrong and (3) are, I think, not straw man reasoning either. I do not think that Senator Cash was actually trying to build a case that was wrong and then cut it down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that where she has gone in this was just a mistake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This regulation relates to the pre 13 August group. It is a change in the administrative arrangements only, and that is all. Let me say that again so that no-one misses this point: this regulation relates to the pre 13 August group. It is a change in the administrative arrangements only, nothing else. It is a very short, very sharp statement. It is a way of ensuring for these groups of people that the administrative burden, which I went through very carefully, is reduced. It actually means that the department, the person who is subject to the bridging visa and the general public will not be inconvenienced by this. It is a very easy regulation to read and understand. Surprisingly, all of what I have just said is said in the explanation issued by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am at a loss, quite frankly, to understand where Senator Cash read all her lines from. I think I have addressed much of what she asked me to address in the short, simple statements that I have had an opportunity to add today to this debate, because without the regulations people must be redetained every time their bridging visa expires. They must be physically redetained for the minister to renew their bridging. Why would you put people through this if you could, through regulation, change it? Fundamentally nothing else changes. Just so that we do not miss the point, 195A, the substantive provision under the act, does not change. There is no change to that. The form does not change; the criteria do not change; the grounds do not change; the process does not change, save for this one piece: the minister after initially issuing the first bridging visa can delegate to the department to do the remainder while the person is in the process. That is quite a simple thing. It is quite an easy thing to grasp. I fail to understand why the opposition have not grasped that, but I do not hold out much hope that they will or even that with my explanation they will acknowledge what 195A and these regulations say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there is no appeal. There are no changes to the appeal mechanism, so all of the things that I listened very carefully to Senator Cash saying are wrong. Nonetheless, I am sure she believes them. With those short words, I commend that we should not have this regulation disallowed. It is a sensible change. I would ask those in the chamber who perhaps are a little more rational on this issue to agree that—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I am glad to hear the minister be very clear about the fact that this change to the bridging visa regulations is not going to impact on those people who have arrived since 13 August, in relation to the announcement that the immigration minister made today saying that this government is about to embark on a whole new regime of temporary protection visas. The idea of allowing individuals to have their claims assessed while living in the community if they are not a risk to the community saves the taxpayer ultimately hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. We know that immigration detention is an expensive operation. Keeping people in detention is costly to the taxpayer and costly to the mental health of individuals and, of course, does nothing to deter people from arriving in Australia seeking our protection. All you need to do is look at the impact over the last few months to see that these types of policies do not stop people running for their lives and seeking protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned, however, that the government is embarking on a new regime to keep those people who have been assessed as genuine refugees on bridging visas. That is what the minister has announced today. We are hearing from Minister Ludwig in the chamber right now that that is not in relation to this regulation and that this regulation is all but administrative. I wonder whether there could be an indication from the government as to whether there is going to be a new regulation for those people who have arrived post 13 August and who will be subject now to the minister's new announcement in relation to not being given a permanent protection visa because of the government's no advantage policy. If I could have an answer on that, then I think I would be able to indicate the Greens' position on this disallowance motion. Without that, it makes it a little bit difficult.</span>

This is a minister who, quite frankly, was part of a government that said that there would be no carbon tax under it, so I personally would put weight on the fact that the coalition is actually right in relation to its summation of the legislation because this government has been proven to have lied to the Australian people time and time again. The minister also says, by way of his explanation for this regulation, that this is a way of allowing the department to now manage the situation. I say this to the minister: perhaps if you had not rolled back the Howard government's strong border protection policies, we would not be in the position that we are in today in having to debate a regulation that is effectively going to get rid of mandatory detention in Australia. Perhaps if you had not rolled back the Howard government's strong border protection policies, the other day we would not have had to appropriate yet a further $1.67 billion of Australian taxpayer money for the infrastructure on Nauru and Manus Island. Perhaps if you had not rolled back the former Howard government's strong border protection policies, there would be an additional amount of over $6 billion for this government to put towards issues like health services, more hospitals and schools, which the Australian taxpayer actually needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But instead, because of the government's gross incompetence when it comes to managing Australia's borders, we have now seen in excess of 30,000 people come to Australia by boat, and this regulation merely gives the people smugglers another product to sell. It allows the people smugglers to say to irregular maritime arrivals who will be here, 'Once you have a bridging visa and you have been let out into the community, guess what: you are not going back into detention'. That is exactly what the minister has just confirmed. He has actually confirmed that the whole reason why the government is bringing in this regulation is: it does not want to have to send people back into detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know why the government does not want to have to send people back into detention. It is because there are no beds at all in detention. Christmas Island is now at capacity. On Christmas Island people are now back in tents, and we all know what happened the last time that people were in tents on Christmas Island as that script has already been written for the Australian people. There were mass riots on Christmas Island. Untold damage was done to Australian taxpayer property on Christmas Island. Because of the sheer quantities of people that were coming here by boat the detention centre could not cope. So when the minister stands up and says that one of the reasons for this regulation is to allow the department to better manage the bridging visa process, I have to say that it is one of the poorest excuses that I have ever come across in my life. In fact, it is an absolute cop-out given the real reason that this regulation has been brought before the Senate. The government has completely, totally and utterly failed when it comes to managing our borders, and that is the reason why the minister, instead of revisiting a decision and then personally making it himself—as section 195A of the Migration Act states the minister should do—he has thrown his hands up in the air and he has said, 'It is all too much for me.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason it is all too much for the minister is the sheer quantity of numbers. There is no other reason at all. If you had only a trickle of boats coming to Australia, the minister, quite frankly, could personally exercise his discretion under section 195A of the act. But when you have the sheer quantity of people coming to Australia and you have no further beds in detention, you only have to look at the minister's announcement today. In Tasmania they opened Pontville, they closed Pontville and—guess what—they have re-opened Pontville today because there are just no beds in the detention network so they have now had to re-open a detention centre that they had closed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you have a detention centre system that is now crumbling under political incompetence, you make the decision that the minister has made. When someone comes here, you get him in and out of Christmas Island as fast as you can because the longer they are there the more likely it is that another boatload of people are going to arrive and you are not going to have anywhere to put them. So you get them into Christmas Island and then you get them on to the Australian mainland as fast as possible. You might select one in 500-odd—I do not know the number—who might go to Nauru or who might now go to Manus Island, but the majority—in fact, almost all—of the people who are arriving on Christmas Island are then coming straight to the Australian mainland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know what happens when they come to the Australian mainland. They get released into the community, they are able to live, they are able to work and they are effectively Australian residents indefinitely. That is because by this regulation the minister is saying, 'I don't need to deal with these people anymore. I've had enough of them. There are too many of them. I can no longer cope because our detention network is at capacity'—and the minister is right about the detention network because goodness knows where they would actually put them. That is a nightmare for the government. Could you imagine if that were to actually occur? He has delegated, he has relegated and he has abrogated—you name it and the minister has done it—his duty to unelected public servants. Section 195A of the Migration Act is very clear. This is a personal power of the minister. The parliament has expressly given the minister this personal statutory authority and regardless of what Minister Ludwig says on his analysis of the regulation you need to remember that Minister Ludwig is part of a government that said there would be no carbon tax at all 'under our government' and, lo and behold, Australians have not only a carbon tax but a carbon tax under which the price on carbon is going to be going up and up and up despite what is going on in Europe and despite the fact that a recent poll has shown that 38 per cent of Australians now believe that they are worse off because of Labor's carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would you believe a minister who has the audacity to be part of a government whose leader said to the people prior to the Australian election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and who then comes in here and tries to fudge his way through the reasons for this regulation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very simple. The Labor government thought they were smarter than the Howard government. They thought: 'The Howard government stopped the boats. They may have stopped them but we can do one better than that.' We all remember what happened in August 2008. Mr Rudd said: 'I'll show that Mr Howard. Not only did he give the people a $22 billion surplus; he stopped the boats. But I can do better than that.' And I have to say that they have, but not in a good way: net debt is $150 billion or $157 billion today, and for gross debt you can add another billion dollars onto that; lift the debt ceiling three times; and wind back the proven border protection policies of the Howard government. Fast forward four years, and guess what? That is the reason we are standing here today: not because the government has suddenly worked out what to do with immigration policy in this country but because the government has shown that it is completely incompetent when it comes to managing Australia's borders. They are desperate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are so desperate that a minister—quite frankly, when you become a minister, you are actually normally quite proud that you have been given by the parliament certain responsibilities, statutory authority, under acts of parliament. Most ministers like to exercise the personal responsibilities that the parliament has given to them as ministers. But not this minister. I have to say that you almost have to feel sorry for Minister Bowen because, if there were any portfolio that you would not want in government, this is it. He cannot give this portfolio away, for very good reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we are here today: because the Labor government have failed yet again to secure our borders and, as a result, over 30,000 people have come to Australia by boat. As I said, the minister has today effectively conceded that the immigration detention network is not just at breaking point but actually broken. Let us be real about this. It is no longer at breaking point. The immigration detention network in Australia has effectively crumbled under the weight of Labor government incompetence. There is no room at Christmas Island. People are in tents. There is literally a simmering pot of tension on Christmas Island. As a result of that, here we are, talking about this regulation. As I said, the minister has thrown up his hands and said, 'It's all too much for me.' He has abrogated the responsibility given to him, regardless of what Minister Ludwig says. Under section 195A of the Migration Act he has delegated his personal statutory responsibility to a public servant. That public servant is not accountable to the parliament, as the minister is. In November 2011, the minister announced that they would be allowing detainees into the community, and Scott Morrison said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Failed asylum seekers who arrive by boat will now be able to stay in Australia for years to pursue their claims through the Refugee Review Tribunal and endlessly in the courts, with broader grounds of appeal, while living and working in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A Government who claims to want to provide a deterrent on boat arrivals would never do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we are not dealing with a government that wants to do this. As such, the coalition does not believe that this regulation is in the national interest. It does not believe that this regulation is in the interests of good ministerial responsibility, and we urge the Senate to disallow this regulation.</span>

                    </a>  Touching, gentlemen! As I was saying, this package of legislation demonstrates so very, very clearly the absolute policy chaos that lies at the heart of this Labor government. What we see here are significant changes to Labor's carbon tax that is just a few months old. It is just a few months since this carbon tax commenced operation, and the government are already having to rewrite the rules. In doing so, they are in many ways backflipping once again on promises they made in relation to the carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the carbon tax is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, backflips in Australian political history. The Prime Minister's famous words were that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led—words put through the shredder immediately after the election when the Prime Minister, in a deal with the Australian Greens, determined that there would be a carbon tax under this government that she leads. Having implemented that carbon tax, having struck deals with the Greens and the crossbenchers to get it through, we now find, months later, that the government is introducing significant changes to the carbon tax. We have heard through the committee process that these changes have been lacking greatly in consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Industry Greenhouse Network submitted to the Senate inquiry that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the ability to comment in detail on the original significant policy changes was limited by the lack of previous consultation and limited explanatory notes, as well as limited time for appropriate and comprehensive analysis of the issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association highlighted that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the consultation process that has given rise to this package of bills has been inadequate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again we see policy on the run from this government, legislation on the run from this government—significant flaws that continue to do damage to confidence in the Australian economy and our standing as an investment destination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do these bills in particular do? The government will say, no doubt, the highlight measure of these bills is the linkage to Europe—that these bills will provide and facilitate initial linkage for Australia's carbon tax with the European ETS. 'Linkage' is one word for it; 'outsourcing' might be another. 'Handing over of complete control' is really in many ways what is occurring—because it has become clear that this is very much a one-way street. Initially, in fact, it is completely a one-way street. The deal that it is being done to date is solely for Australian companies to be able to buy European permits, but there is no opportunity for investment or activity in the other direction. So it is a one-way street in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But more significantly, because of the nature of the European scheme and the nature of the deal being struck, we see a situation where effectively the price of the carbon tax in Australia in future will be determined by decisions in Brussels rather than decisions made in Canberra. The price of the Australian carbon tax will be influenced by what happens to the price of the European ETS—directly influenced by what happens in that regard. We had that clearly stated by none other than the secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency during Senate estimates, who made it very clear. I will quote the question that I asked of Mr Comley:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Senator BIRMINGHAM:  If Europe were to take steps that saw them adopt a more ambitious target than they currently have, that would result in a higher carbon price in Europe and therefore a higher carbon price in Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Comley:  Other things being equal, that is right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is right. If Europe decides to adopt more ambitious targets for emissions reductions it will result in a higher carbon price in Australia. I went on and asked Mr Comley:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Senator BIRMINGHAM:  If Europe were to, as they are discussing doing, potentially restrict the number of permits that are available, that would result in a higher carbon price in Europe and all other things being equal, a higher carbon price in Australia? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Comley's response:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So: from none other than the secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, clear confirmation that the policy decisions taken in Europe, in Brussels, as a result of this linkage will have a direct impact on the rate of the carbon tax, the carbon price, in Australia. That, of course, is well recognised by those who made submissions to the Senate inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Qantas made clear their views, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of concern to Qantas is that the EU will have the ability to artificially control the price of carbon in Australia and the impact on Australian industries through the EU carbon price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Qantas were not the only ones. The Cement Industry Federation also highlighted the fact that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it appears Australia has very little say over any major scheme changes that are contemplated by the European Union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The CIF is concerned that Australia's future scheme design, the setting of caps and the inclusion of allowable offsets, may be unduly influenced by the European Union …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we see very, very clearly that what is highlighted as a hallmark feature of this legislative package—the EU linkage—in fact will leave us in a situation where Australia's control of the destiny of our carbon tax is limited because the European scheme will have a direct impact on the rate of that carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see that it has had an impact on policy at international climate change negotiations. The Climate Institute appeared before the Senate inquiry and, in very prescient evidence, Mr Erwin Jackson from the Climate Institute said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… our [Australia's] posture on the Kyoto protocol over the next few months will be important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did he think it would be important? He thought it would be important because:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have an agreement with the European Commission but that needs to be ratified by member states in terms of a mandate to negotiate a treaty. If Australia is not playing ball in Doha and not playing ball in Kyoto, that will have an impact on how European member states view the negotiation of the links between the two schemes …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Mr Jackson is suggesting is that it would be necessary, in terms of playing ball on Kyoto—namely, a second commitment period for the Kyoto protocol—that European member states would see it as a condition for the negotiation of a treaty, for Australia to indeed take those steps, despite some of the preconditions that the government had previously set out for doing so. Miraculously, what happened in the last couple of weeks? Mr Jackson's predictions came true and the government has given the green light to that second commitment period, just as Mr Jackson predicted we would do, so as to allow and facilitate the approval of those European member states for the negotiation of the treaty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So already we have seen that this deal is impacting on policy decisions in Australia. Already we have seen that this government is changing its policy approach to a second commitment period under Kyoto in response to the deal that it has signed with Europe. That is before we get to the point where, of course, we will see the higher prices or the influence of Europe set the rate in terms of Australia's carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the influence that is of concern; it is also whether that influence comes from a scheme in which one can have confidence—whether there is integrity in that scheme. Extensive evidence was given by the University of Queensland. We heard from representatives of the University—Professor Paul Frijters and other academics—that there are real concerns about the integrity of the EU scheme. He talked about the verification approaches undertaken and, in doing so, highlighted that there was no uniform mechanism for the verification of what people report under the EU ETS. We know that in Australia we have had a greenhouse emissions reporting scheme in place for many years, predating the carbon tax. But in Europe they have a verifier that looks at the documentation provided. According to the witnesses from the University of Queensland, the verifier is supposed to do spot checks—but as yet there is no operational peer-review mechanism for these verifiers and hence there is a strong possibility that people choose the verifiers that go easy on them. That is, of course, an unverifiable statement in itself—precisely because there is no peer-review mechanism as yet. 'It is a murky world of verifiers,' was the evidence that we heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They claimed to have gone through some of the actual documents which verifiers have to send in and there was a lot of room for interpretation, or manoeuvring, in what we saw; there was a lot of room to manoeuvre on what you actually counted as the fuel that went into a company. Then there is the fact that there are different applications in place across European member states as to how their ETS works. Again, the University of Queensland highlighted that the incentives to, as it were, penalise your own companies are very limited within the European Union. These were some of their main concerns about why it is that we cannot have confidence in the nature of that European scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia also highlighted concerns and indicated that in the EU emissions trading scheme there had recently been various instances of integrity issues around registry security and fraud. Then there are the issues not just of integrity but of how Europeans may deal with what is being seen as a problem of overallowance and overallocation. Again, the University of Queensland noted the potential for Australia to find itself in a situation where Australian companies are buying spare permits from the European Union without anything at all happening to overall carbon emissions—highlighting the futility and potential pointlessness of this exercise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are differences that exist as well. The European Union scheme, for all that it is held up as the grand design, does not capture such things as fugitive emissions, unlike the Australian scheme. The Australian Coal Association argued that in the EU the majority of permits have been, and continue to be, allocated without charge to the traded sector during a lengthy transitional period. The linkage with the EU ETS highlights the disadvantage imposed on Australian producers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation does not just link to the EU. It also provides for the abolition of the floor price that was in the carbon tax initially passed by this government. Why did they have a floor price in their legislation? According to Ms Gillard on 13 September 2011, the floor price:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… will limit market volatility and reduce risk for businesses as they gain experience in having the market set the carbon price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As recently as August this year, Mr Combet argued that they were 'committed to the arrangements we have legislated'—commitments that I am sure Senator Milne thought would hold true. Time and time again the government restated its commitment to the floor price. They argued that it would provide confidence. In July this year Mr Combet said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've put in place a floor price and a price cap to provide some confidence over the first few years about the potential variability of the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, Mr Combet on the floor price:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will reduce risks for businesses as they gain experience in having a market set the carbon price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place, Senator Wong said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is the case that our policy does include a price floor which acts as a safety valve for investors in low-emissions technology by establishing a minimum price for the first few years of a flexible price period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So much for safety valves; so much for the reduction in risk; and so much for the need for extra confidence that the government argued required this floor price. Within a few months the government has been all too happy to abolish it. Once again, it is an example of this government advocating and arguing for one thing and doing completely the opposite. That is what we have seen here; that is what we have seen throughout the carbon tax debate. And this is just another example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even advocates for some of these changes such as the Climate Institute have argued against the abolition of the floor price and highlighted again to the Senate inquiry some of what they thought were the beneficial effects of having a floor price. The coalition is not defending the existence of a floor price. Frankly, on this side we do not believe there should be a carbon tax at all. But we highlight that it was the government that put in place a floor price, started a carbon tax in July of this year and has now ditched that floor price it said was so necessary for certainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all of these changes—the abolition of the floor price, the link to the EU and so on—what has been remarkable is that the government has provided absolutely no updated modelling and no evidence of what they expect the forward revenue of the carbon tax to be. It is still based on modelling that is now years old.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we have seen that those who may actually give some serious thought to these matters are not willing to stand by that modelling. Mr Comley, the secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, indicated again during Senate estimates that he had no confidence in what the modelling suggests the carbon tax will be in the years to come. When asked whether he stood by the idea that it would be at $29 when the fixed price period ends, the best we could get from Mr Comley was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I do not think the current market estimate is implausible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When asked whether Senator Milne's prediction of a $50 carbon price could come true, Mr Comley said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is true … that in the recent past the European Union allowances did trade up to $50. … In the sense that European Union units have traded at that price so is it completely conceivable, it is not completely inconceivable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it could be $29 per tonne; it could be $50 per tonne. There are those who argue it could be less. The Climate Institute argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What can be predicted with confidence is that based on the proposed linkage and limits, Australian carbon prices in 2020 will likely be substantially higher than the recent forecasts …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Climate Institute told the Senate inquiry—'substantially higher than the recent forecasts'. So Labor's carbon tax, with its spread of costs across the economy that are already forecast to keep going up, according to the Climate Institute, will, in 2020, as a result of the changes in this legislation, be significantly higher than is forecast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation also makes a lie of government promises that they are interested in achieving lowest cost abatement. Why? Because it imposes a 12½ per cent quota on what is alleged to be the lowest cost abatement—the CDMs, the Kyoto carbon units. So, on those areas where the government have said, 'We're all about getting, through international linkage, the lowest cost abatement result,' they are now suddenly saying, 'But you can only do that for 12½ per cent'—another measure that was roundly condemned by a range of submitters to the Senate inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is in debates about lowest cost abatement, floor prices or the like, we see once again through this legislation a government in chaos, changing this big policy just after a few months, and doing the opposite in so many instances of that which they promised. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  I rise today's to support the Clean Energy Amendment (International Emissions Trading and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and related legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a disgraceful performance! At some point Senator Birmingham ought to have acknowledged that the whole point of the legislation that we have before us, the whole point of the emissions trading scheme which we have—and he persists in calling it a tax; it is an emissions trading scheme—is to try to reduce greenhouse emissions, consistent with the challenge we have with global warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would remind the Senate that a new report for the World Bank that has been out this week, done by leading climate scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, has concluded that the planet is on track to heat by four degrees by 2100 if governments fail to change direction. Four degrees—that is an unliveable planet. This is the challenge that we are now trying to deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition obviously has no interest whatsoever in addressing the fact that global warming is accelerating. We should recognise that all the efforts we are making are not enough. We have to be doing far more. There have to be far higher levels of ambition than the currently agreed five per cent that the coalition thinks is adequate. I can tell you it is not adequate. The President of the World Bank, Dr Jim Yong Kim, notes that the impact of four degrees of warming would be devastating—there would be inundation of coastal cities, unprecedented heatwaves in many regions, extreme weather events and irreversible loss of biodiversity, including coral reef systems. He said that he hopes the World Bank report will shock us into action. Well, the World Bank has got another think coming. Nothing will shock the Abbott-led coalition into action, it would seem—nothing at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report by the World Bank follows on from the report by the International Energy Agency, which says we are currently on track for 3.6 and greater degrees of warming. It says that only by leaving two-thirds of the fossil fuel reserves in the ground can we have a 50 per cent chance of avoiding two degrees of warming. I am going to say that again because the government needs to hear this, with its mad dash for coal seam gas, expanded coalmining around the country and massive increases in coal exports—again supported by the coalition. The International Energy Agency, not renowned for being a rabid green body, has said that two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves have to stay in the ground if we are to have a 50 per cent chance of avoiding two degrees of warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the challenge before us. It was the basis on which the Greens negotiated with the Prime Minister to provide government to the Labor Party; it was in exchange for delivering a carbon price in this period of government. Yes, the Greens drove that as part of the negotiation. It is why Labor is in government. And I am very proud to say that we now have a clean energy package negotiated in this period of government, and it will be the single piece of legislation for which this government is remembered in the longer term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again that the International Energy Agency has said just this week—and I know that Senator Birmingham will not be able to stand to hear this, but I am going to report it to the chamber—that Australia's carbon price scheme is 'an example of the standard of leadership that the International Energy Agency has been calling for so that the energy sector can be protected from sudden and vacillating climate policy that paralyses investors and disrupts energy markets'. That is from the International Energy Agency. It goes on to say that Australia's implementation of carbon pricing marks 'the first major fossil fuel energy resource rich economy to take the most cost-effective mitigation measures'. It goes on to encourage supplementary policies to the carbon price that are required to successfully make a transition to a low carbon economy. It welcomed the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—$10 billion into renewables. Of course the coalition opposes that, but the International Energy Agency recognises that it is a necessary complementary measure. In fact, the IEA calls for a further increase in energy efficiency and fuel efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What it says is that the design of the emissions trading scheme fits well with the International Energy Agency's findings on lessons from international experience, but with the exception of the free permits and cash given to coal fired generators. Once again the IEA and the Greens are totally in line here and completely out of sync with both Labor and the coalition, because the Greens do not want free permits and cash going to the generators. I foreshadow here, Mr Deputy President, that I have an amendment, which has been circulated to the chamber and which will go into the committee stage, to refer to the Productivity Commission the generosity of those gestures, that support and those subsidies to the coal fired generators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come back to the substance of the debate, the linking to the EU. Throughout the negotiations with the government on the carbon price, the Greens were concerned that, if we went with the hybrid model and we had the fixed-price period, we did not want the price to completely collapse at the end of the fixed-price period. You had to give some certainty into the future about a price trajectory for business so that they could start making decisions based on that. Once you lost the fixed-price period the problem always was that the price would collapse to the CER price because 50 per cent of the permits would be able to be bought overseas. That is the cheap price—the CDM price. It is cheap because of the lack of verification for a lot of those particular permits. Anyway, it would have collapsed to that, and the CER price is extremely low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens wanted to make sure that we went through the fixed-price period, and we got a floor price out. We actually wanted a floor price for much longer than three years, but we settled on three years as part of the negotiations. However, our big concern was always that come 2018 we would have a situation where we would fall off the price cliff again, and we would be back to the CER price. So we would have the fixed-price period, the floor price period and then go back to the CER price, which was likely to be very low. That was always a concern for the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when the opportunity came to link with the EU, we embraced it because it meant that the price would be the European price into the future; it would not be the CER price. I make this point specifically here because people often have this throwaway line, saying: 'Oh, if only the Greens had supported Kevin Rudd's CPRS. We would have had emissions trading earlier.' Yes, we would have, and what we would have had is a five per cent reduction target—completely, utterly and absolutely inadequate for the task of global warming—and no mechanism to increase the target. We would have been stuck with it. Because it allowed for unlimited overseas permits, as in up to 100 per cent, do you know what the price would be today, Mr Deputy President, if we had had the scheme agreed by Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull, both members in the lower house? It would be one euro. The price today would be a five per cent target and a carbon price of one euro, which I think at the moment is about $1.25 or $1.30—something like that. That is what the price would be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone out there who deludes themselves into thinking that Mr Turnbull and Mr Rudd had negotiated some marvel need to know that it would have been a five per cent target and $1.25 for the price. What sort of transformation in the Australian economy would there have been at a price of $1.25? Zero, zilch, none, I can tell you, Mr Deputy President! What is more, you would not have had the Clean Energy Finance Corporation put $10 billion into renewables; you would not have had the Carbon Farming Initiative; and you would not have had the $1 billion over six years into the Biodiversity Fund either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when the opportunity came to link with the EU, the attraction for the Greens was that the EU would not link with Australia if there were a 50 per cent capacity to buy those CER cheap permits. They insisted that that come down. Bringing the CER limit down to 12½ per cent so that it is still possible to buy 50 per cent of your permits overseas, but with only 12½ per cent being the cheap CERs, means that the effective price for the Australian scheme at the end of the fixed-price period when it goes to flexible pricing will be the European price. And the European price means that anyone in Australian business now has price certainty in the trajectory, because they know that the price is going to be the European price and they can start planning for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to this argument about a loss of sovereignty, that is an utter nonsense. Under the previous scheme, which Mr Turnbull agreed to, the Australian scheme price would, as I said, be set by the CER price, and that reflects primarily the Chinese price. If you want to go down the argument of overseas sovereignty, if you go with the CER price you are dealing with the Indian and Chinese price; if you go with the European Union your global price is your European price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good thing about the linking is that it is a significant step towards the global carbon price. It means that we are now linked with an emissions trading scheme covering 27 countries. It encourages linkages with other emissions trading schemes. We know that one is being introduced in South Korea and we know, for example, that just this week the first round of permit auctions also took place in California. That will be the world's second-largest emissions trading scheme. It is the ninth-largest economy in the world, and, whilst at the moment California is saying that it is not linking, just this week also I think that Parliamentary Secretary Dreyfus said that the two governments were setting up a forum to share experience and that the scheme designs were similar. What that suggests is that into the future there may be a possibility of linking with subnational schemes such as the Californian scheme. Certainly, China is going down the path where its pilot schemes are larger than the whole Australian scheme—its pilot schemes! So the big opportunities are there for that kind of linking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated, we now have the issue where, yes, we have given away the Australian floor price. But we are doing so on the basis of: what will the European price be by the time we go to flexible pricing in 2015? If the European price is higher than the floor price, then we have set ourselves on exactly the trajectory where we were, if not better. The question is: what will the European price be in 2015? Of course, I do not know that. Forecasts are highly uncertain, and it depends on the state of the European economic recovery. But what I do think that I can definitely say is that the Australian carbon price will be higher from 2018 onwards under the linkage with the EU than for the previous scheme, where the price would have been set by China and India and be the CER price in 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the forward price for European Union permits currently ranges from A$11 to just under A$14, and reforms can be expected to lift the price. Currently, the European Union is engaged in a reform process. The European Commission will present a draft amendment to the EU's Emissions Trading Directive to backload 900 million permits to the Climate Change Committee next month. That would push back 900 million permits from 2013-15 to 2019-20, and I know that the European Union is trying to not only backload them but actually take them out and eliminate them from the scheme, therefore permanently driving up the price by taking out a whole lot of the permits in that auction scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coal-dependent Poland is currently opposed to the measure that the European Commission is trying to take, but Poland would need the support of several other members to block the move. A three-month scrutiny period is required. The ballot could occur in April 2013, but analysts are now generally expecting that it should go through the European Parliament for ratification in the second half of 2013. In fact I understand that the European Commission is also checking on whether it actually needs to get it through the parliament. But, either way, we can expect that next year this process of taking out 900 million units will occur, therefore driving up the European price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the issue that the Greens looked at carefully. We are seeing that their forecasts for the European permit price in 2015, if this backloading can occur, range from 15 to 20 euros. If the European Union gets the backloading through next year, the projected price is 15 to 20 euros, and I remind the Senate that the floor price was going to be $15, $16 or $17 from 2015, 2016 or 2017. So, if indeed this backloading occurs, the Greens had argued that the valid reason for deciding to go with the European linkage would be that the price would be greater than the floor price, but the benefit is to give Australian businesses the price trajectory of Europe on which to base their thinking, and they would know that that is what they will be working on and why they will be doing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The European Commission also identified six options for structural reform to complement the backloading, such as tougher targets or cancelling permits, as I mentioned. That will take longer, but nevertheless it suggests to me that there is considerable thought going on in Europe about structural reform and, if that structural reform goes ahead, then clearly it could be an even better outcome in terms of carbon pricing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I say 'an even better outcome', I am talking about a higher price. We need to drive this transition to a zero-carbon economy as quickly as possible, and the best way of doing that is through the price. That will bring on renewable energy, the 100 per cent renewables we need, especially in conjunction with the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation and ARENA, which also the coalition want to abolish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you have a situation where all the coalition want to have is a five per cent reduction target, which is nowhere in the ballpark of what is necessary, and, after that, where are they going to get the money from to be able to do this? Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, goes out saying that he is going to abolish carbon pricing. That means that there will be $70 million a year, which is currently going to Tasmania for the hydro as a result of carbon pricing, gone. That is the windfall that I have delivered and this parliament has delivered for Hydro Tasmania. Seventy million dollars a year into the Tasmanian economy will be gone. The coalition will be voting against that. Senator Abetz will be taking that out of Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the tax-free threshold. Until now the situation has been that you pay tax once you have earned $6,000. Now you do not pay tax until you have earned $18,200, and the coalition are going to say, 'Sorry, guys, you are going to go back and pay tax when you have reached $6,000.' If they do not, where is the money going to come from to be able to finance that change to the tax system?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you have the billion-dollar Biodiversity Fund. Only yesterday I spoke to rural leaders—some of them youthful, some of them not so youthful—from around the country. They really appreciate the Carbon Farming Initiative and, indeed, the Biodiversity Fund, because they are enabling connectivity in the landscape and paying them for stewardship that they did not formerly have, and they want that to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a situation now where the coalition is refusing to acknowledge the size of the challenge on global warming. We cannot afford a world with four degrees of warming. Five per cent is nowhere near the ballpark. I think it is a disgrace that Australia is signing onto the Kyoto protocol second commitment period and putting in a five per cent target. It is nowhere near enough. I am afraid that in Doha this year the rest of the world will see Australia's five per cent as locking in such a low level of ambition that it could actually undermine the capacity of getting to a global treaty by 2015 rather than driving it. I would have liked to see the government recognising all of the science, particularly the latest science that is coming in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government now has before it the draft IPCC report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. It has got that report. It knows how bad the science is showing the world is becoming under a warming scenario. Any kind of leadership on climate change would have said that it is time for getting ourselves onto a radical shift towards the low-carbon economy and getting on with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of that, there is a decision to stick with five per cent, which is so far away from what is needed, and so drastically bad for our children and future generations. I look at the science and think to myself: how can people sitting in this parliament, thinking about future generations and intergenerational equity, possibly be thinking that it is appropriate to allow to get in place the feedback mechanisms from which there will be no return? That is the tragedy here. We are the first generation of people who will determine what life is like for every generation after us in a way that is irreversible. That is a shocking responsibility. It is a huge load of responsibility for us to carry, and this parliament is not shouldering that load to anywhere near the extent necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are the only people in this parliament saying that the climate challenge is real, is urgent and needs to be dealt with at a level of ambition beyond where we are now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the link with the EU improves the carbon price. That is why I negotiated with Minister Combet to get the outcome that we have. We talked about it for several months. I am pleased with this outcome, and I would hope that the Senate will now support the Greens, when we get to the committee stage of the debate on these bills, refer to the Productivity Commission the absolutely excessive money going to coal fired generators and free permits and have them cut right back, because it is not justified by one iota. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  I support the passage of the Clean Energy Amendment (International Emissions Trading and Other Measures) Bill 2012 and the other clean energy bills. Yesterday, Senator Mason made a rather boisterous contribution to the matter of public importance debate, where he made the point that it would be irresponsible for this generation of political leaders to pass on to the next generation and future generations the cost of policies and inaction. I must say that, when it comes to this particular policy area, I agree with him. But his words were hollow, because that is exactly what the opposition are doing in not supporting these bills and by pledging to wind back the emissions trading scheme should they come to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a point that was made quite well during the hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Scrutiny of New Taxes, which looked thoroughly into Labor's carbon price regime. On 20 August 2011 in those hearings Ms Meghan Quinn, general manager of the Macroeconomic Modelling Division for the Department of Treasury, made the point that delaying will cost future generations much more. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The analysis that we did suggests that a delay in global action by three years adds around 20 per cent to the first year of global mitigation costs and delaying entry by a further three years adds a further 30 per cent to the first year of mitigation costs. This suggests that, as you delay, the costs only get greater through time …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The costs of delaying action on climate change will be passed on to future generations. That is why the approach that the opposition are taking to these bills and to the regime that Labor has set up is irresponsible, and that is why the words from Senator Mason yesterday were quite hollow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week we have been reminded of the importance of taking action on climate change. Another major report—this one titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Turn down the heat</span>—was released by the head of the United Nations climate summit in Qatar. In it, the World Bank suggests that, unless significant action is taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century, the Earth is on track to warm by four degrees Celsius, with potentially disastrous consequences for our environment, particularly in this nation, and our economy. The changes associated with this would have dramatic and devastating effects on all parts of the world including Australia, the bank said, but in particular on developing and poor nations. Those countries will be the most vulnerable, and many of them are our neighbours in the South Pacific. Their economies and environments will be affected by a delay in responding to climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the light of such warnings it is important that we shoulder the responsibility and that we work within the international community to reduce global emissions for the good of our planet and for the benefit of future generations. That is why I am pleased to support these bills, which ensure that Australia is doing its part—importantly, in concert with other nations and the international community—to reduce emissions through a flexible, internationally linked emissions trading scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will facilitate linking of Australia's emissions trading scheme with other countries' emissions trading schemes—this includes the EU emissions trading scheme—by removing the floor price that was to operate in the first three years of the flexible price period and by restricting the quantity of eligible Kyoto units that a liable entity can use to acquit their Australian carbon price liability to 12½ per cent of that liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will establish the flexible registry arrangements that will ensure linking with other emissions trading schemes in circumstances where direct links between registries cannot be put in place. Linking Australia's emissions trading scheme to the international market is in our nation's interests and indeed in the interests of Australian businesses. As Treasury modelling clearly demonstrates, without the ability to access international carbon markets and without the ability for Australian businesses to purchase international permits, the cost of meeting our emissions reduction target will double. Again, this is a point that was made quite eloquently and well during the inquiry by the Committee on Scrutiny of New Taxes into the carbon price, and in particular Loy Yang Power, when they appeared before the committee—</span>

                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-Time"> (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:51):</span>  What does it take to give a child the best start in life? It is a question that is reflected upon daily by parents, teachers, early childhood educators and politicians, and one that we must continue to ask ourselves as we look at implementing historic reforms to early learning and the childhood sector. As everyone in this chamber would agree, high-quality education is a critical element in providing children with the very best start in life. Education is not only the key to overcoming structural inequality and disadvantage; it is a crucial part of securing Australia's long-term economic growth. However, the benefits of education cannot be realised without investment in early years education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been well established that children do their most important learning in their first five years. Indeed, evidence indicates that 90 per cent of brain development occurs in these critical early years. A child's experience in the first five years sets a course for the rest of their life, including for their long-term educational outcomes. With this in mind, I wish to again place on record my support for the United Voice Big Steps campaign. Senator Feeney is in the chamber with me, and of course he would support the Big Steps campaign.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CAROL BROWN:</span>
                  </a>  I also wish to place on record my support for the dedicated ECEC workforce and provide an update on their campaign activities. The United Voice Big Steps campaign is a grassroots, sector-wide campaign to secure professional wages in the early childhood education and care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2007 we have seen sustained growth in the number of children and families using early childhood education and care services. On any given day in Australia, up to one million children attend long day care services across the country. In my home state of Tasmania, 17,000 families use long day care services. Despite the increase in participation rates for children in formal care, the pay and conditions of some 60,000 people employed in the early childhood education and care sector remain unacceptable. Currently, an early childhood educator earns just over $18 per hour. It is a tragic reality that our tireless early childhood educators, who play such an important role in shaping the future of our young people, could earn more by cleaning tables in a fast-food restaurant or stacking shelves in a supermarket than they do as early childhood educators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of this economic hardship, large numbers of people working in the early childhood education and care sector have been forced to leave in search of higher-paying work. Over 180 educators leave the early childhood education and care sector each week due to the low wages and poor conditions. The United Voice campaign is focused on addressing the structural problems within the funding system for the early childhood education and care sector. The campaign is calling on the government to provide $1.4 billion in recurrent funding to the sector, which would secure a professional wage for educators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed to widespread reforms to the early childhood education and care sector. The reform agenda is significant, and the measures include the development of a national curriculum, plus a new national quality framework bringing state and territory based licensing and quality systems into one nationally consistent system. As part of the government's commitment to building a high-quality, accessible and affordable early learning and care system in Australia, the government will invest a record $22.3 billion over the next four years in the early childhood education and care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national quality framework commenced progressive implementation on 1 January this year. This framework will improve the child-to-staff ratios, set new staff qualification requirements, introduce a new quality-rating system and establish a new national oversight body. It incorporates the national quality standard to ensure high-quality and consistent early childhood education and care across Australia. The government has also introduced changes to make child care more affordable and more accessible to families. The government has increased the rebate to 50 per cent and the cap to $7,500 per child per year. We know that these reforms are not only critical because they make high-quality and affordable child care a reality for low- to middle-income families; importantly, they also assist in raising the workforce participation rate of women. Women's workforce participation is sensitive to a range of factors, including affordability and the quality of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding the significant progress made by the government in achieving these historic reforms within the early childhood education and care sector, there is still more work to be done. The package of reforms announced by the Council of Australian Governments sets a bold vision for early childhood education and care in Australia. To achieve the government's goals, it is crucial that the sector is served by a stable, qualified and professional workforce. To achieve this we need to support the sector in retaining, recruiting and training staff. And to do this we must support professional wages. That is why I have given my support as an ECEC Champion, as many of my colleagues have, to the United Voice Big Steps campaign, because investing in the early education sector is so vitally important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 27 September this year I visited the Tiny Tackers ECEC centre in Glenorchy, a suburb in the electorate of Denison in Tasmania, along with my colleague Senator Lisa Singh and Jane Austin, the Labor candidate for Denison. Tiny Tackers is owned and operated by a young woman named Erica and is a thriving and vibrant local centre. As part of our visit to Tiny Tackers, the Big Steps campaign presented us with their 2013 budget submission stating the case for professional wages. The campaign also premiered their newly launched television commercial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the lead-up to the rally on National Big Steps Community Action Day on 17 November, I took up the challenge of living on an educator's wage of $18 an hour. I was partnered with Alicia, an ECEC worker, who presented me with a Big Steps cheque for $622.88, representing my pay for the week. Alicia also went through her own budget practices and the tough decisions she makes, week in and week out, to make ends meet. This exercise enables people to fully understand the difficulties faced, and it very much focused me on the tough budget decisions that need to be made. I thank Alicia for sharing her time and personal story with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Big Steps Community Action Day was a day for families, the sector and the wider community to celebrate and support the fantastic work of early childhood educators and to support the Big Steps budget call to the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and the Treasurer, Mr Swan, for a $1.4 billion budget allocation for professional wages. Rallies were held across Australia in every capital city. At the Hobart rally, around 900 people participated in the Big Steps action day. I had the opportunity to speak at the rally in Hobart, and I was joined by my colleagues Senator Lisa Singh and the Labor candidate for Denison, Jane Austin. In all over 12,000 people, including families, ECEC centre staff, supporters and members of the wider community, turned out to show their support for the campaign for professional wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my contribution draws to a close, I would like to acknowledge the tireless work of United Voice, particularly the Tasmanian state secretary, Helen Gibbons, and the Tasmanian campaign coordinator for the Big Steps campaign, Jannette Armstrong. The Big Steps campaign has enabled me to meet with many early childhood educators and carers—mostly women—who have shared with me both their genuine passion for the work they do and the difficulties they face in making ends meet. So I want to acknowledge all these people and their passion and commitment to the campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of the debate on lifting wages for our early childhood educators and carers, we must never forget that the undervaluing of educators reflects the broader inequality which women continue to experience in the workplace today. The early childhood education and care sector continues to be a largely female dominated sector, and it is a sad reality that early childhood educators remain socially undervalued and underpaid. The Big Steps campaign is so much more than a campaign about better wages. It is a campaign about respect for the profession, it is about maintaining quality and it is about the continuation of education for our children. I would like once again to thank those involved in the national day, particularly Rebecca Hayes, who emceed the event, and of course United Voice for organising the rally. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

No-one welcomes the loss of an innocent child, whether that child be Israeli, Palestinian, Jewish, Muslim or Christian. Nor should the international community accept direct attacks aimed at innocent civilians or the use of human shields in breach of international humanitarian law. Yet Hamas have continued to initiate such attacks on innocent civilians and to use many innocent Palestinians as human shields in their conflict against Israel and Israeli citizens. This should draw widespread criticism from the international community. However, reporting on this issue has remained unbalanced, with a disproportionate share of media condemning Israel's attacks but overlooking the attacks by Hamas on innocent Israeli civilians and the right for Israel to defend itself and its citizens against such attacks, as it is entitled to do under the UN charter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an article by Arsen Ostrovsky entitled 'Where is condemnation of Hamas terror?' he referred to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">… those who continue to call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against the Jewish State … but are silent in the face of Palestinian terror.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This includes some within the Australian Greens party. Ostrovsky further states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm angry that while human rights organisations such as Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam and others do not waste a single opportunity to condemn Israel … the human rights of Israelis are seemingly not important enough for them. Is Jewish blood really that cheap?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If our families were being attacked, would we not defend our clear right to act in self-defence to protect them from harm? Undoubtedly so. The same principle also applies to Israel and its right to protect its citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, many politicians and reporters in the international media have failed to condemn Hamas, with some even actively defending it, when Hamas is not an organisation that is interested in a peaceful outcome to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is no more clearly evidenced than in the Hamas charter itself. The Hamas charter, in its second introductory paragraph, calls for Israel's destruction, stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Article 7 of the Hamas charter goes further, calling not only for the elimination of Israel but also for the elimination of its Jewish population altogether, stating that it '<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">aspires to the realisation of Allah's promise'</span> as set out in a referenced hadith:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal has stated that the charter is 'a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons'. Yet Hamas have refused to oppose this document outright or to amend it. What is more, since Meshaal said this, Mahmoud Zahar, a co-founder of Hamas and a member of the Hamas leadership in Gaza, said in November 2010 about the Jews:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there is no place for you among us … no future among the nations of the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the Prime Minister of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, Ismail Haniyeh, said in May 2012:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We must live up to our motto … which says, we will not recognize Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Palestinian station al-Aqsa also said on 18 November 2012:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">From the Palestinian people to the Zionists: We've missed the suicide attacks. Expect us soon at bus stations and in cafes … Don't go to sleep, because we may get you in your sleep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of these words will ever lead to a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As Harvard Law School's Professor Alan Dershowitz recently noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Hamas's tactic is as simple as it is criminal and brutal. Its leaders know that by repeatedly firing rockets at Israeli civilian areas, they will give Israel no choice but to respond. Israel's response will target the rockets and those sending them. In order to maximize their own civilian casualties, and thereby earn … sympathy … Hamas leaders deliberately fire their rockets from densely populated civilian areas. The Hamas fighters hide in underground bunkers but Hamas refuses to provide any shelter for its own civilians, whom they use as "human shields." This unlawful tactic puts Israel to a tragic choice: simply allow Hamas rockets to continue to target Israeli cities and towns; or respond to the rockets, with inevitable civilian casualties among the Palestinian "human shields."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gerard Henderson concurs, stating in an article on 20 November 2012:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It is known that Hamas … deliberately place their rocket sites within the deeply populated areas of the Gaza Strip. This means that when Israel strikes at military targets, there are likely to be a number of civilian casualties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;" />I, for one, am willing to unreservedly and unequivocally condemn Hamas, their attacks on innocent civilians and their use of human shields, resulting in the deaths of both innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In these circumstances where, as reported, there have been more than 1,150 rocket attacks on Israel since last Wednesday, Israel has a clear right to defend itself. In saying this, I am supportive of the sentiments of Ostrovsky, who states in his article:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm angry that the world notices only when Israel undertakes its most basic sovereign right to defend its citizens. Can you imagine if even one rocket were fired on Washington, London, Moscow or Sydney? No nation on earth can, or should, tolerate such attacks on its people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

Although this is only a brief obituary, I think it is important that her life, research and inspiration are recognised here tonight. Marita tragically died of cancer at the age of 51 on Monday this week and is survived by her four children, Rachael, Jessie, Brigid and David, and her husband, Dr Alex Thompson.</span>

A graduate of the University of Tasmania, she was also president of the Launceston Historical Society and actively contributed research and energy to many important areas of Tasmanian life, such as Tasmanian architecture, bush nursing, immigration, rural youth in Tasmania, early European contact with Tasmanian Aborigines, and rural women's affairs. She both worked for and was actively involved with Tasmanian organisations such as the Heritage Council of Tasmania, the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, the National Trust of Australia and the Cultural Heritage Practitioners of Tasmania.</span>

She later adapted this work to become curator of the exhibition <span style="font-style:italic;">Ordinary women, extraordinary lives</span>.

Ordinary women are almost always absent from the Australian story. Bush nurses are an example, they achieved so much for their community and for women in general.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her project and research addressed the optimal status and position of women by working to remove stereotypes and assumptions about women. It reinforced the critical role of women in the development of the Australian bush and for the maintenance of health. It demonstrated vividly that their achievements were great despite significant hardship. Further, it also demonstrated how powerful these ordinary women were as they created significant social change through quiet personal achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bush nurses were at the forefront of emancipation of women despite their working in isolation. Marita described her travelling exhibition as being significant because 'women's history, particularly rural history, is often invisible'. I certainly hope Marita's important research, and the relevance of its message to our community today, remains visible—as I hope does her legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish by highlighting some words submitted by Marita, on behalf of the Launceston Historical Society, to the Launceston mayor and the Tasmanian Ratepayers Association over calls to shut down and silence the town clock atop the Launceston city post office. They are called 'A Plea to Keep the Chimes Ringing'. She wrote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The sound of the clock has been the source of many recent phone calls to the Launceston Historical Society since it has attracted media attention and now LCC business.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">would like to register our support for the sound and indeed the historical essence of Launceston to remain intact and continue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Members, associates, and indeed travellers at the recent … national conference, all commented what a delight it is to hear such a unique sound continue in such a historic regional centre.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Launceston Post Office is one of the jewels in the crown of Launceston's heritage and indeed it was a sad day when the main Post Office closed after such a long and historical use. For the clock to be silenced or the chimes to be excluded during the night would be to the detriment of a long tradition and indeed landmark sound of Launceston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally, I believe that the Launceston town clock is one of the key features of my home town, ringing all hours of the morning. It is the contributions of individuals such as Marita towards the social capital of a place like Launceston that actually make where we live in our communities unique. We all contribute in our own way and Marita's contributions were quite significant and often went unrewarded, so I would like to take this opportunity to thank Marita for all the work that she did. Marita, I will remember you when the bells chime.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I was fortunate to have been invited to represent Australia at the International Day for Asbestos Victims recently, a conference organised by the French national association of asbestos victims, ANDEVA, and held in Paris at the senate building in October. More than 250 scientists, activists, asbestos victims, researchers, parliamentarians and medical professionals from 20 countries had travelled to attend the conference, which included a day of keynote addresses, a working roundtable and finally a march through the streets of Paris with more than 5,000 workers, unionists, victims, politicians, medical professionals and anti-asbestos advocates participating—marching together 'For a world without asbestos'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ANDEVA organiser Marc Hindry had invited me to share Australia's asbestos story—our long and dark legacy with asbestos, as well as the positive work now being done in tackling this insidious carcinogen under the leadership of the Gillard Labor government. Listening to the range of speakers, it soon became clear that Australia is leading the way on asbestos management. Many of the speakers and participants were interested in the work of our government and especially the work of our Asbestos Management Review, which, under the chairmanship of Geoff Fary, handed its report to Minister for Workplace Relations, Bill Shorten, earlier this year. I believe this document will definitely become a blueprint for other nations as they look to tackle the full brunt of the asbestos legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the roundtable session came two documents, the first an appeal to the Brazilian Supreme Court, calling on it to expedite the judgement regarding the unconstitutionality of the federal law permitting the mining, sale, use and transport and export of asbestos. Brazil's Supreme Court is currently hearing opposing cases brought by those who support the continued use of asbestos and those in favour of banning it. The arguments made by each side are based on constitutional law. Those against the use of asbestos ask—given the Brazilian constitution acknowledges a citizen's right to life and to health, and the dignity of labour—how the use of a known carcinogen could be allowed. Those arguing for the continued use of asbestos say that laws pertaining to trade and interstate commerce reside in the constitution and that laws banning asbestos would revoke Brazil's controlled-use policy which underwrites the commercial exploitation and use of chrysotile asbestos. The international community continues to await its finding, and there is great hope that the Brazilian Supreme Court will find in favour of a ban on asbestos, putting an end to the use of 15 per cent of the world's asbestos usage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second document signed by conference delegates was a letter to newly appointed Quebec Premier Pauline Marois, congratulating her on the courageous position taken by her government in withdrawing the financial assistance promised to the Jeffrey asbestos mine in Canada.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last November, the then Leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown, and I successfully moved a motion in the Senate against the Canadian government, expressing the Australian Senate's disappointment in the Canadian government and its continued stalling around the listing of chrysotile asbestos in the Rotterdam convention on prior informed consent. This motion also called on the Canadian government to recognise the profound global implications of Canada's continuing export of asbestos, most notably to developing parts of the world such as India. I would like to take this opportunity to add my personal congratulations to Premier Marois, as I believe it was her leadership on this issue, along with pressure from unions and NGOs worldwide, which ultimately led to the Canadian government's announcement in September that they would no longer oppose the listing of chrysotile asbestos on the Rotterdam convention when it comes up again next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The march made me realise just how worldwide this carcinogenic substance is and how it has affected so many thousands of people's lives. As people marched, they carried photographs of their loved ones who had died from asbestos related disease and placards in various languages asking for an end to asbestos, for a world without asbestos. I met a man from Belgium, Eric Jonckheere, who grew up very close by to the Eternit asbestos factory in Kapelle-op-den-Bos. Eternit is the fourth largest producer of asbestos in the world. After 11 years of litigation, last year his family finally won a civil case against Eternit. Eternit promptly announced it would appeal the verdict. His mother had died, his father had died and his two brothers had died from asbestos related disease and, yes, he also has an asbestos related disease. Yet there he was with a smile on his face, proud to be marching alongside so many others just like him who had lost their family, marching to end the trade and use of this deadly substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The courage displayed by so many people from across the globe at this rally was inspirational. I learnt that all the efforts that have been made in Australia by trade unions, support groups and governments are shared by so many others just like us in countries right across the world. That is the nature of this issue: asbestos is everywhere. Too many companies like Eternit have lied, deceived and lobbied to continue using asbestos, all for the purpose of making profits off other people's misery, sickness and death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia we had our own version of Eternit in the James Hardie company, which dominated the market from the 1940s until the 1980s, selling asbestos products despite clearly knowing the dangers of asbestos from as early as 1935. I spoke about Hardie's attempt to shift their assets overseas to the Netherlands in a bid to avoid liability. The fight to hold them accountable, by people such as the late Bernie Banton, ABC journalist Matt Peacock, the AMWU, especially Paul Bastian, the ACTU and, notably, Greg Combet, and the Asbestos Disease Foundation of Australia, was courageous and fierce to say the least.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, some of you may have seen the telemovie <span style="font-style:italic;">Devil's Dust</span>, based on Matt Peacock's book <span style="font-style:italic;">Killer Company</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: James Hardie Exposed</span>, which was aired by the ABC over two nights. It received rave reviews while also helping raise vital awareness in the community. Ironically, while <span style="font-style:italic;">Devil's Dust</span> was being aired on our screens the NSW Court of Appeal handed down the final judgement in the long-running court battle with former James Hardie non-executive directors and shamefully reduced their penalties. In May, the High Court had fined them $30,000 each and disqualified each from serving on boards for five years for misleading the Australian Securities Exchange. However, last week, the NSW Court of Appeal reduced these sentences to fines of $25,000 and to a disqualification from serving on boards for just two years. This decision has been condemned by many, as it should be, and I too share their sheer disappointment in the decision of the NSW Court of Appeal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken about asbestos in this place on several occasions. Following my time in the Tasmanian parliament as a minister on this issue I now am proud to be a part of the Gillard Labor government, which is tackling the issues associated with this carcinogen at the national level. The last decade has seen significant inroads in the fight against asbestos, and with Asbestos Awareness Week upon us next week it will be timely to take stock of where we are at as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the second ACTU Asbestos Summit, held in Sydney in August this year, Minister Bill Shorten responded decisively to the Asbestos Management Review and announced for the first time the establishment of a national Office of Asbestos Safety, which is to commence work on a national strategic asbestos management plan, due to be completed by 1 July next year. This is so important for us as a nation. Australia currently has the highest reported per capita incidence of asbestos related disease in the world, and an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Australians will be diagnosed with an asbestos related disease in the next 20 years. So we continue the fight, particularly the call for a global ban on asbestos. Together and with perseverance we will achieve exactly that. Of that, I am confident.</span>

                  </a>  The answer to the senator’s question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The Small Pelagic Fishery season commences on 1 May and concludes on 30 April of the following year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) A concession holder in the Small Pelagic Fishery is able to harvest quota allocated for a season at any time during the season. Given the seasonality of fishing for all target species in the Small Pelagic Fishery, with the exception of Australian sardine, the scenario of catching an entire quota allocation before the end of a fishing season and then immediately after the start of the next season is unlikely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) No.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) has not undertaken an analysis of the taking of twice the total allowable catches of target species over a 12 month period or less in the Small Pelagic Fishery. The ability to combine quotas across two seasons is essentially a one-off event requiring the fisher to not fish at the start of one season, retaining a full quota until later in that season, to then fish for the full quota in the final months of one season and fish the subsequent annual quota early in the next season. This scenario could not be repeated in the lead up to the next season as the fisher would have no quota at all until that following season. The repeat of such a scenario would require a biennial pattern of fishing with no fishing in the intervening year. If this was to become a significant fishing practice then AFMA may need to consider the implications for the management plan of the small pelagic fishery. However, the current conservative quota settings for commercial species in the fishery minimises the implications of this unlikely scenario.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While research on taking twice the total allowable catch in the fishery over a 12 month period or less has not been undertaken the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) has used management strategy evaluations to test the long-term sustainability of stocks fished in the small pelagic fishery (Giannini et al. 2010). Sustainability of these stocks over a projected 30 year period has been tested under the current Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 harvest strategy approaches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Results show that the current Tier 1 and Tier 2 harvest strategy approaches for these stocks are robust to the time of year over which catches are taken, given catches are set at a specified percentage of the most recent best estimate of biomass in each year. The settings for total allowable catches in subsequent seasons are revised to correct for changes in fishing mortality and biomass each season. Under these approaches, stock biomass is maintained near target levels over the long-term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, under a Tier 3 approach, where a fixed catch is taken each year, the catch levels are set so low (500 t) that catches are unlikely to reduce biomass below target levels, even if the total allowable catches for two years (at 500 t each) are caught over a short period spanning two seasons. This is the direct intention of ensuring that catches allowed for under Tier 3 approaches are set at very low levels.</span>
