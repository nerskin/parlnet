                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  I rise to make some re­marks regarding the Higher Education Support Amendment (No. 1) Bill 2011. As people would be aware, FEE-HELP is available to eligible full fee paying higher education students and VET FEE-HELP is available to eligible full fee paying and certain state government subsidised VET students studying in higher level education or training, and provides a loan for all or part of a student's tuition costs. I think we all know in this chamber how important it is that we do continue to support our students in disadvantaged areas where they need that assistance and particularly in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">VET FEE-HELP was introduced under the former Howard government in 2007 recognising there was a need to encourage students to take up higher level skill qualifications by reducing the financial barriers associated with study. I am sure that colleagues would agree that over time the recognition of the VET sector has indeed increased and does play a very significant role in educating our young people today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will introduce a number of streamlining measures to the Higher Education Support Act 2003. This will streamline the process for the providers, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the program. There has been some concern in the sector that the difficulty in being able to access the program has acted as a disincentive. As I understand it there have only been a relatively small number of providers that have been part of this program and this piece of legislation aims to improve that accessibility. The coalition supports the bill, its effect being to improve the process and allow for a significant increase in quality education providers who apply for and are approved as providers under the act to be able to offer that FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note in the legislation the addition of the new requirement that bodies corporate seeking approval as either a higher education provider or a VET provider are 'fit and proper' for that purpose, which provides the appropriate level of scrutiny. I note also that the minister must specify, by legislative instrument, the criteria which must be taken into account in deciding whether a person is a fit and proper person before the body is approved. I think there is, on both sides of this chamber, the recognition that there was some need for streamlining this legislation. The efficiency that we will see as a result of the introduction of this legislation will make the process more workable and will allow more of those providers to be able to access this program which in turn is going to benefit the students. The priority for the coalition is to ensure that students are able to access that help as and when they can, and this legis­lation will certainly improve the efficiency and streamline the process in order for that to happen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This bill is a compilation of amendments across several areas. It seeks to give effect to a number of the government's election commitments. It includes amendments to the Social Security Act 1991, the Social Security (Adminis­tration) Act 1999, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. These amendments cover changes to the work bonus, family tax benefit part A, youth allowance, the baby bonus, the matched savings scheme and payments to Thalidomide Australia Fixed Trust beneficiaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This packet of measures is interesting because it appears that the government does see some election commitments as more equal than others. Another election com­mitment, which is well known to us all, was the Prime Minister saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead.' For some reason the election commitments that we are talking about today are more worthy of honouring than that solemn pledge that the Prime Minister gave during the last election campaign. I think it is a good thing for governments to honour their election com­mitments, so it is good that the government is seeking to implement these, but it does put into stark relief that massive unprecedented election commitment not to introduce a carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that is before us seeks to extend the existing work bonus to enable people of age pension age or qualifying age who take up paid work, including occasional or variable work, to get more of their pension when they are working. The coalition raised in the past the issue of pensioners who worked in seasonal employment as Santas at Christ­mas time or as school exam super­visors and who had their pensions cut due to the receipt of short-term income. One case in Canberra has become quite well known. A man worked for a few weeks as a department store Santa Claus, having his photo taken with children, but, because of the increase in his income over that short time, he was then penalised in his pension. It is now readily conceded on all sides of the chamber that legislation should be encouraging people to work, not the opposite. The coalition have welcomed the changes to the work bonus. They are changes that we called for and changes that we proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains measures affecting family tax benefit part A. These amendments were taken from the recommendations of the Henry review. The Henry review put the case that family payments should be the main form of assistance for children aged up to 18 years or until the completion of secondary school in the year a person turns 18. These changes will raise payment rates for each eligible child aged 16 to 19 years so that they are the same as for those aged 13 to 15 years. This means that when a child turns 16 the family will not experience a drop in assistance. At present most low- and middle-income families experience significant reduc­tions in government assistance once their child turns 16. These amendments will have an effect on rent assistance as the increased rates for older children will make them eligible to be considered for rent assistance. At present rent assistance cannot be claimed for children aged 16 or over. The increased FTB part A payment for 16- to 19-year-olds in school or training will be $781 per year higher than the rate of youth allowance paid for 16- and 17-year-olds. The bill will position FTB part A as the main form of help offered to young people undertaking secondary or vocational education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The matched savings scheme was introduced by Labor in 2009. It matches, dollar for dollar, savings up to $500 for people on compulsory income management. At present the MSS starts automatically for anyone on compulsory income management who starts a money management program. The changes proposed here will shift the onus onto the individual to claim for the MSS. Labor's matched savings scheme does have some early indications that it will not achieve the desired effect. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>reported on 16 March this year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Only one person has received the full $500 available under the Gillard government's $53 million matched savings scheme for welfare recipients launched last July.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The article goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Between July 1 and December 31, 102 people entered the scheme, and of these 53 completed the money management course, 36 were still doing it and 12 had dropped out. To date only one person has successfully completed both requirements and received a full matched savings payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only one at that time. I understand there have been a few more since then. But as the President of the National Welfare Rights Network, Maree O'Halloran, was quoted as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Matched Savings Account appears to be yet another one of the government's income management-linked policies that, it seems, is untried, untested and unpopular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also represents a lost opportunity to do some justice towards rural and regional students with respect to the youth allowance issue. This legislation amends the Social Security Act 1991 to preclude students aged 16 to 17 who are in full-time secondary or vocational education from receiving youth allowance unless they are considered independent, are living away from home or were receiving youth allowance immediately before beginning their course to ensure that youth allowance recipients are not adversely affected if one of their siblings remains in or transfers to the FTB system as a result of the changes to the FAA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this bill was before the House, Labor had the opportunity to admit that their position on Youth Allowance was wrong and support the urgent introduction of legislation to reinstate the former workplace partici­pation criteria for independent youth allowance to apply to students whose family home is located in inner regional areas. Labor changed the criteria for youth allowance last year, requiring inner regional students to work 30 hours a week for 18 months over two years. Not only are jobs offering these hours difficult to find in rural communities but some students are having to defer tertiary studies for up to two years. Trying to balance these hours with study is very difficult. The coalition are fighting to reinstate the former, fairer criteria for inner regional students, but to date our efforts have not been successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will not be opposing this bill. However, I would like to note again that, whenever Labor claim to be honouring election commitments, as they are here today, it will always be overshadowed by that great broken promise not to introduce a carbon tax.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  The coalition will support the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011. This bill makes the following changes to taxation laws: it adds two organisations to the list of deductible gift recipients, namely, the Charles Perkins Trust for Children and Students and also the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It also allows regulations to impose rules on self-managed super funds regarding personal use—collectables, paintings and so on. It will allow the use of tax file numbers as identifiers to locate super accounts and facilitate consolidation of accounts, while making changes to the way Australian taxes, fees and charges are made exempt from the GST. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just make a few comments in relation to some aspects of this bill, specifically in relation to changes to personal-use asset rules for self-managed superannuation funds. This provision allows the government through regulation to impose rules on self-managed super funds invest­ments in personal-use assets such as collectables and artworks. The sole-purpose test of the SI(S) Act requires that assets of a superannuation fund be held for the sole purpose of generating retirement income. The super system review, also known as the Cooper review, recommended that self-managed super funds should be prohibited from investing in personal-use assets and those held should be disposed of within five years. The review found that personal-use assets lent themselves to personal enjoyment and therefore failed the sole-purpose test. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government announced on 3 July 2010 that it did not support the review's position but that it would tighten the requirements around investment in personal-use assets. These amendments allow the government by regulation to impose rules relating to investment of personal-use assets by self-managed super funds. Those rules can cover: artwork, jewellery, antiques, artefacts, coins or medallions, postage stamps or first-day covers, rare folios, manuscripts or books, memorabilia, wine, cars, recreational boats, memberships of sporting or social clubs, or assets of a particular kind if assets of that kind are ordinarily used or kept mainly for personal use or enjoyment, not including land. The coalition are of the view that the approach proposed by the government reflects a sensible balance. We are also aware that it is supported by the self-managed super fund industry body, SPAA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the proposal to use tax file numbers as identifiers to locate super accounts and facilitate consolidation of accounts, this is of course part of the so-called 'super stream' proposals that came out of the Cooper review. The coalition very strongly supports the super stream related recommendations in that they will, through increased efficiencies, deliver real increases in value to superannuants and retirees across Australia. This provision allows superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account holders to use tax file numbers to locate accounts and facilitates consolidation of multiple accounts. There are current restrictions on the way super­annuation funds can use tax file numbers. In particular they are not permitted to use tax file numbers to locate accounts for the purpose of consolidation. It does not replace account or membership numbers but removes the requirement that super funds use other methods of searching for multiple funds before using tax file numbers. An individual can still choose not to give their tax file number and there are no changes to the consequences for failing to do so. It is important in order to maximise individual retirement savings that smaller amounts are consolidated as early as possible. I pause here to say that, while we congratulate the government on having acted on this recommendation, the coalition are very disappointed that Minister Shorten has continued in his persistent failure to act on the Labor Party pre-election commitment to require the Productivity Commission to design a more open, transparent and competitive process for the selection of default superannuation funds under the modern award system. We have had a case study publicised in the media in recent days which clearly demonstrates the inevitable consequences of the type of closed shop anticompetitive process that was instituted by this government. Before the election, the government recognised that and said they would fix it. But the current minister—I would argue because he has a serious conflict of interest—is highly reluctant to act on that. The direct consequence of the minister's failure to act in relation to the selection of default superannuation funds under the modern award process by Fair Work Australia sees hundreds of thousands of Australians channelled into under­performing super funds, which means that the retirement savings of those Australians will be smaller than they otherwise would be. That is a direct result of the minister's failure to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under pressure, the minister said he might start to look at this in 2012. The coalition says that is just not good enough. If a process is manifestly closed shop, anticompetitive, not open, not transparent and not competitive—and we know that it is not because the government recognised that before the election—if there is a process which is so broken that it leads to outcomes like the ones that were publicised in the media last week, it should be fixed immediately. There is no excuse for the minister not to act, other than that he wants to protect the closed shop arrangements for as long as he can get away with it so that more and more Australians are channelled into underperforming funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes on top of the minister's reluctance to act on a whole series of other Cooper review recommendations designed to improve the transparency and corporate governance arrangements in the superann­uation industry. Those recommendations include having independent directors on superannuation boards and requiring directors who want to sit on multiple superannuation boards to make a declaration to APRA, the regulator, that there is no foreseeable conflict of interest. These are the sorts of recommendations that go directly to the confidence that working families and retirees across Australia can have in the superannuation system. Only if we get the corporate governance and transparency arrangements right, only if we continue to ensure that our superannuation industry is as efficient, competitive and transparent as possible, will we have the assurance that the returns for families and retirees across Australia will be maximised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call again on Minister Shorten to reflect on his duty as a minister to act not in the vested interest of the union movement or other sections of the superannuation industry but in the public interest, in the best interest of working families and retirees across Australia. I urge the minister to have another look at the urgency of sorting out some of these issues, which are getting worse under his watch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, I also point to the current developments in Victoria, where merger talks between two superannuation funds are close to collapsing—they might well collapse in the next few days—on the basis that union representatives for one of the super funds have not been able to get a guarantee that there will be a continuation of union nominated positions in the merged entity and also because they are not happy to go along with the proposal for democratic elections of super fund boards in the future. Super fund trustees are required to act in the best interests of members in making judgments on whether or not a merger should go ahead. If, as has been reported, the merger in Victoria is going to collapse on the basis that some current super fund trustees have not been able to obtain a guarantee that there will be union nominated positions in the merged entity, that is not a decision, on the face of it, made in the best interests of members. It looks to me like a decision made on the basis of the self-interest of the current super fund trustees and the bodies they might think they are representing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision in the legislation in relation to tax file numbers being able to be used as identifiers to locate super accounts and facilitate consolidation of accounts is a good step as part of a broader superannuation reform agenda, but there is a lot of unfinished business in this legislation if we are committed to ensuring that our super­annuation industry is as efficient, transparent and competitive as possible. I have touched on a few of the issues. There are quite a few more. I suspect that in the weeks and months ahead there will be serious debate and serious focus on the minister's and the government's failure to act on some of these issues despite clear and emphatic pre-election commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also deals with exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges from the GST. That is a rather straightforward proposition which we support. The bill makes various other amendments to tax laws which do not require any further discussion at this point in time. With those few words, I again confirm that the coalition will be supporting this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MILNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:58</span>):  I rise today on behalf of the Australian Greens to support Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011. I want to make some comments in particular in relation to schedule 2, which allows regulations to be made setting the rules for self-managed super funds investing in personal assets and collectibles, including art. The Australian Greens believe that artworks and other collectibles must continue to be legitimate investments for self-managed superannuation funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were particularly distressed when the Cooper review into the superannuation system made a recommendation that self-managed superannuation funds no longer be allowed to invest in personal assets and collectibles, including art. The art industry in Australia was rightly concerned that such a blanket ban would adversely affect the art market in Australia. The Cooper review's recommendations would have had a considerable negative impact on the art market and would have been particularly detrimental for Indigenous artists. Super­annuation investments are worth almost $100 million per year to the art industry according to the Save Super Art campaign, and the recommendation by the Cooper review to dispose of currently owned art and the cessation of future investments means that the art industry would potentially face considerable instability and the income opportunities for artists would have been put at risk. The Indigenous art market, as I indicated, would have been greatly impacted by the Cooper review recommendations because, as we are all aware, there is a significant global market for Indigenous art, making it attractive to self-managed super­annuation funds and therefore creating an incentive for buyers with around 60 per cent of Indigenous art being bought through the self-managed superannuation funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really critical issue. It is well-known in Australia that we value the arts, but we fail to support them. We support them in fairly small ways, with government grants, but being an artist in Australia is not a lucrative profession for most. We are all aware of how artists are supported in other countries. While I was in Copenhagen for the climate talks, I went to an artist village in the city. It had been built after the Second World War. Basically they built an area for artists to live where they were provided with low-rent accommodation providing they were engaged full-time in creating art. There was recognition that the Danish people value the contribution to the community and to the culture by the artists involved. Now it is quite a fantastic little area of the city because artists, over time, have contributed to it by creating sculptures and by painting various murals around. It really is a beautiful part of the city. I thought what a great contribution, what foresight the government had to build this village to support artists in this way because we know so many artists struggle to make a living from their art.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same thing goes in this country. Most of us would agree that the capacity that Indigenous communities now have to make money from their artwork has been one very significant step forward for Indigenous people to be able to get income into communities where that previously had not occurred. The Greens in particular are cognisant of how important the art community is in Australia in reflecting to ourselves who we really are as a nation. We get told all the time how important the economy is, but it is the health of the society which we as a community ought to be concerned about and it is artists who pose the hard questions. You only have to go down and have a look at the new Indigenous art galleries at the National Gallery—they are quite fantastic; for those of you who have not been, I thoroughly recommend going—to see there are a number of confronting pieces in that exhibition which really challenge all of us to think about the way we have engaged with Indigenous communities and which challenge us to think about how serious we are about reconciliation and so on. It is incredibly important when thinking about something like changing the regulations for these self-managed superannuation funds that, in a desire to enforce the absolute test that the purpose of the investment is for superannuation income, we do not under­mine the income of the arts community around the country. There is a very strong recognition that the ban on investing in art will ultimately have resulted in harm to artists around the country because it would have eliminated the incentive to buy artworks and therefore decrease the market and therefore the returns to our visual artists in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign the Australian Greens joined with the Save Super Art campaign, calling on the government to reject the recommendation of the Cooper review and allow superannuation funds to continue to invest in art. The Save Super Art campaign was supported by numerous organisations, including the Australian Artists Association, the National Association for the Visual Arts and numerous art galleries. To the government's credit, it listened to the concerns of the campaign, it listened to the concerns of artists around the country. You can imagine what would have happened if the Cooper review recommendation had been taken up that the current owners had to dispose of their art straight away and cease any future investment. There would have been a complete collapse in the value of a lot of the works that would have been forced onto the market all in one burst. I am glad the government listened to those concerns and announced, again during the election campaign, that the government would not implement a ban on investing in art and other collectables but would move to clarify the rules surrounding such investments. The Greens do appreciate the need for investments by superannuation funds to comply with the sole purpose test under­pinning the superannuation investment regime. We do understand that the govern­ment is currently consulting on the draft regulations that will be made under the changes that will occur when this bill passes the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not want to presume the outcome of those consultations going on in the community at the moment, but we do know that there remain concerns about the restrictions that are being imposed on collecting art and other personal assets. One of the concerns raised by the Australian Artists Association includes the additional costs associated with storing art off the premises of parties related to the super fund, and the restrictions on leasing art, even when that art is leased at commercial rates to related parties. Again the issue here is to make sure it is a genuine superannuation investment. If you have made that investment and then you cannot have the enjoyment of that for yourself because it is regulated that you need to have it off premises or whatever, or if you lease it to a related party at a commercial rate, I understand that is still going to be a matter of grave concern to people in the arts community. I think that that might well constitute a disincentive on the part of self-managed superannuation funds to invest in art. I think artwork is different from other personal assets. We continue to talk these issues through with the government to make sure that the integrity of the superannuation system is maintained but also to ensure that art can continue to be a practical investment for superannuation funds and that such investments can continue to support our art industry. I want it very clearly on the record that that is the perspective of the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must do everything we can to support artists out there now—artists who are relying on the fact that self-managed superannuation funds can collect art—to maintain the art market and provide an income. As I indicated before, Indigenous communities in particular are reliant on this. We have worked hard on the resale royalty scheme to start generating income for communities. In that context, we have argued strongly that there needs to be government funding to assist community art centres—and Indigen­ous community art centres in par­ticular—to be able to build capacity to handle all of the administrative work that is going to have to be undertaken in terms of the resale royalty regime and so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not have a history or a culture of philanthropy in Australia when it comes to the arts. Unlike other countries, where you have wealthy benefactors who put huge amounts of money into the arts in all sorts of ways, we find symphony orchestras and leading artists struggling. We do not have the culture, which does exist in other places, that takes on, if you like, patronage to emerging artists, supports them and creates opportunities for them. In other countries too, governments take a much more prominent role in supporting the arts than we have in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people argue that perhaps the community sees this as elitist, but I would question that. When I go around Australia I see the numbers of people who go to local exhibitions and local theatre. When an orchestra or the Australian ballet, for example, come to regional communities, they are patronised with great enthusiasm. An example I would put on the record here is the Burnie Gallery, on the north-west coast of Tasmania. They are a fantastic regional gallery. They have a large number of events and exhibitions, which are widely patronised and highly valued in that part of Tasmania. We have a thriving arts community in the state of Tasmania. But we do not have a community that is particularly wealthy, so we do not want to put disincentives in the way of people who want to support local artists through self-managed superannuation funds. We do not want to put a disincentive in the way of Indigenous communities to have ongoing benefit from the artwork which has been a significant contributor to improved income in remote and regional communities throughout Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those remarks, I support the bill. I look forward to engaging with the govern­ment further as the regulations are developed in relation to covering personal assets and collectables under self-managed super­annuation funds. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  The coalition will not oppose the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 3) Bill 2011. This bill makes the following changes to taxation laws. It provides a 12-month GST-free export period for new recreational boats from 1 July 2011. The measure is designed to assist Australian exports of recreational boats and amends the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 to overcome a technical problem with the imposition of general interest charges in certain circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the provision of a 12-month GST-free export period for new recreational boats from 1 July 2011, the intended effect of the new provision is to provide a 12-month period within which new recreational ships can be exported from Australia as a GST-free supply. Under the existing law, a purchaser or the supplier must export the ship from Australia within a specified 60-day period, unless the period is extended by the commissioner, in order for the supply to be treated as a GST-free supply. Introducing this 12-month export period to apply to the supply of a recreational boat enables a purchaser of a boat to gain experience operating the boat in Australian waters before having to remove it from Australia. Sailing or motoring the boat out of Australia is expected to be the most common means of exporting, although there is no requirement for the boat to be exported in this way. In order for the supply of the boat to be treated as a GST-free supply there are two tests that must be satisfied. The ship must be a new recreational ship; it cannot be a substantially reconstructed boat, and it cannot previously have been sold, leased or used since the completion of its construction. And the ship must not have been used for any disquali­fying activities, such as carrying out a business. As I have mentioned, the coalition will not oppose this particular amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, this bill also amends the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 to overcome certain technical issues with the imposition of general interest charges. The tax law imposes a general interest charge for the late payment of income tax and shortfall interest charge liabilities. The Tax Laws Amendment (Trans­fer of Provisions) Act 2010 rewrote and transferred the relevant general interest charge imposition provisions for outstanding amounts of income tax and shortfall interest charges from the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936—the ITAA 1936—to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The purpose of this rewrite was to remove any ambiguity in the provisions and, again, the coalition will not oppose it.</span>

Schedule 1 sets the gross domestic product adjustment for pay-as-you-go instalment taxpayers at four per cent for the 2011-12 income year instead of eight per cent. This will allow taxpayers using this methodology to smooth their tax burden over the 2011-12 and 2012-13 tax years.</span>

Schedule 3 allows a percentage of insurance costs for total and permanent disability policies that can be claimed as deductions by superannuation funds to be specified in regulations. Schedule 4 excludes from the reportable employer superannuation contributions definitions of certain employer contributions to superannuation made pursuant to a requirement that employees cannot influence.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  The coalition supports the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011. This bill increases the Medicare levy and the Medicare levy surcharge low-income thresholds for individuals and families in line with increases in the consumer price index. Similar bills have been introduced by the previous coalition government and the current government in every year since 1996-97. The bill amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and families. The dependent child student component of the family threshold will also be increased. These increases are in line with movements in the consumer price index. The bill also increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below aged pension age so that they do not have a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill further amends the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge–Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to increase the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold in line with movements in the consumer price index. The provisions maintain the thresholds for low-income earners, and not to provide this indexation would, in effect, be a tax increase for low-income earners and pensioners. As such, the coalition supports these changes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  The coalition supports the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. Schedule 1 to the bill amends the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to modify and streamline its structure. The act will be shortened by omitting almost all of the schedules to the act and instead incorporating treaties by reference to other accessible resources, principally, the Australian Treaties Series online database of treaties. This will substantially reduce the size of the act, and is a sensible housekeeping measure. Schedule 2 to this bill amends the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to give the force of law in Australia to new taxation agreements with Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, Malaysia, Samoa and Turkey. The Aruba, Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa agreements cover the allocation of taxing rights and transfer pricing adjustments. The Chile, Malaysia and Turkey agreements cover the avoidance of double taxation and tax evasion. The legislation is representative of Australia's commitment to international agreements to avoid double taxation, codify tax allocations and combat international tax avoidance. As such, the coalition supports this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  My understanding is that the Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill 2011 is a bill to modernise and reorder the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and to make certain amendments to clarify potential ambiguities. The bill seeks to achieve those objectives by co-locating the definitions currently scattered throughout the act, placing the act's pro­visions in a more logical order, providing that an action by a minister other than the minister who is authorised to perform that action is not invalid merely on that basis and inserting a new section to confirm for the avoidance of doubt that the common law de facto officer doctrine applies. This will ensure that, if an officer has been invalidly appointed, acts performed by the officer in that position are not automatically invalidated. This doctrine was affirmed by the High Court in Cassell v The Queen (2000). The bill specifies that everything in an act that is enacted by the parliament should be considered part of an act, allowing meeting participants to be in different locations and to participate using technology such as videoconferencing. Lastly, it adjusts the definition of 'document' to include things like maps, plans, drawings and photographs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My learned colleague Senator Brandis advises me that in 1993 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs published a report on the drafting of Commonwealth legislation titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Clearer Commonwealth law</span>. One of the committee's recomm­en­dations was that the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel should publicly review and rewrite the Acts Interpretation Act. In response the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel jointly issued a discussion paper entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901 </span>in 1998. Following consultation on the discussion paper, a number of recom­mendations were made to improve the usability and readability of the Acts Interpretation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As is clear from the history, the amendments to this legislation have been a bipartisan project over several years and several governments. The act is an important part of the machinery of Commonwealth legislation to which recourse will often be had when seeking to resolve ambiguities or divine the technical meanings of acts and regulations. Accordingly, the coalition supports the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  It is a pleasure to speak on the Product Stewardship Bill 2011. This bill establishes a national framework to support voluntary co-regulatory and regulatory product stewardship and extended producer responsibility schemes to provide for the impacts of a product being responsibly managed both during and at the end of its life cycle. Through these measure it is hoped, including on this side of the chamber, that the environmental, health and safety impacts of products, particularly those impacts associated with the disposal of products, will be more effectively managed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commitment to establish this national framework, underpinned by the legislation before us today, was made by the govern­ment in its November 2009 National Waste Policy: Less Waste, More Resources statement. This National Waste Policy has been endorsed by all Australian governments at state and territory level, through both the Environmental Protection and Heritage Council at the time, in November 2009, and COAG in August 2010.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition fully supports the principle of product stewardship being, as it is outlined in the National Waste Policy:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the shared responsibility for reducing the environmental, health and safety footprint of manufactured goods and materials across the life cycle of a product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself offers a subtly different definition from the National Waste Policy, namely that it is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… an approach to reducing the environmental and other impacts of products by encouraging or requiring manufacturers, importers, distributors and other persons to take responsibility for those products. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this has been a long work in progress and work that has involved certain sectors of industry along the way. I am well aware that some sectors of industry are particularly enthusiastic to see this legislation passed. I especially note the national TV and computer sectors, who have a proposed national TV and computer product steward­ship program that we would expect, from the advice that both industry and government gave us during the negotiation phase, to be one of the first out of the starting blocks. This program already has members representing 70 per cent of total imports of computer brands into Australia and 80 per cent of sales in Australia. The TV and computer scheme obviously is of particular importance as we move through the phases of the switch over from analog to digital signals and because of the increased volume of the already significant supply of electronic waste that those industries will generate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the coalition is particularly supportive of the bill providing for voluntary product stewardship schemes, as set out in part 2 of the bill. These sit alongside the requirements and opportunities for co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes outlined in the bill. Part 2 of the bill establishes a mechanism to encourage and recognise product steward­ship without the need to regulate and also to provide assurance to the community that any voluntary product stewardship scheme is operating to achieve its stated outcomes, and it authorises the use of product stewardship logos in connection with these arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Global Product Stewardship Council, an independent, non-profit organisation dedicated to understanding and advancing the principles of product stewardship, says that in its experience, as reinforced by overseas participants in the International Product Stewardship Summit, Australia has had greater success with voluntary programs than many overseas jurisdictions have. It also says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Stakeholders are more likely to collaborate on and effectively implement voluntary and/or regulatory approaches than where approaches are in unilaterally mandated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Approaches requiring greater levels of regulation should be pursued only after market-based, voluntary and co-regulatory approaches have been clearly shown to be relatively ineffective in achieving desired outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are principles that the coalition would support and would urge and expect the government to keep in mind during its application of the powers that this legislation provides for. We do expect that where industries are able to deliver effective voluntary schemes then that is exactly what all sides of politics in this country would like to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The peak body for Australia's lighting industry, Lighting Council Australia, have several months experience in administering their own voluntary product stewardship scheme. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The industry ownership bestowed by a voluntary or co-regulatory approach should lead to better outcomes among industries prepared to assume such responsibility. To reduce costs on both industry and government, all efforts should be made to encourage voluntary rather than regulatory approaches. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this bill does provide for all three—voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory—schemes. There is a place for all three, particularly in terms of the capacity to bring in recalcitrant parts of industries to ensure that the bill has a universal effect. Under the bill, accreditation of voluntary schemes will be on a cost-recovery basis through a fee for service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will spend a moment addressing some of the concerns that have been highlighted during consideration of this legislation. A Senate inquiry was held, as is customary, and I thank those who participated in that inquiry: the witnesses; the committee staff, as always, for their detailed report; and my colleague Senator Fisher, who engaged particularly effectively in this inquiry to examine some of the issues and concerns that industry and other groups had. We heard a range of concerns, some of them relating to the consultation approach, some of them relating to the expected effectiveness of the scheme and some of them relating to the potential for industry to be roped in or surprised by its inclusion in the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways, we heard extreme views—from those who feared that all industries may suddenly find themselves subject to a mandatory scheme, at one extreme, and those who believed that the legislation was ineffectual and would achieve absolutely nothing at the other extreme. Those two extremes perhaps suggest that there is a middle way, and the legislation maybe has found that middle way. Nonetheless there were specific concerns raised about a range of factors, in particular concerns about the criteria as well as industry concerns about an element of surprise that theoretically could exist for industries to be roped in under the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased that we have been able to work through this legislation and issues such as the criteria. A range of amendments standing in the name of the government, the Greens and the opposition have been circulated in the chamber. These have been worked on in a collaborative manner. I thank Senator Ludlam and Senator Farrell for their work, as well as the officers of the department who have worked with Senator Farrell and all parties to ensure that we can come up with some sensible amendments that we hope go some way to appeasing some of the concerns. Importantly, the amendments that will be moved will provide for a new definition of the product stewardship criteria—a definition that is, I think, less open-ended than the definition provided for in the bill as it stands and that ensures that criteria, though I suspect still relatively easy to meet for industries that genuinely should be included in such a scheme, are at least a bit more of a hurdle to ensure that you could not come up with a scenario where almost any product of any industry could fit or meet the criteria as they were previously drafted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also put in place some provisions that will ensure that there is a degree of forewarning about products that the government is looking at or considering. So the government will, under the amendments proposed, be publishing lists of products being considered for accreditation or regulation under the act. There will be a committee established—a review mech­anism—to ensure that industry and key players in this sector all have some degree of input. These are important changes that we believe will provide at least for a greater level of involvement and consultation and hopefully a stronger outcome of industry confidence and participation in this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the government confirms in the explanatory memorandum for this bill, the product stewardship criteria are only one factor in determining whether regulations, co-regulatory or mandatory, can be made with respect to a class of products. There are two other considerations in addition to the criteria. One is that the bill requires that the minister be satisfied that making the regulations will further the objects of the act, and again that is a factor that has been reinforced time and again during discussions and deliberations of the committee and behind closed doors about how this bill will function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, and I think particularly important, is the requirement—of which the government assures us throughout the explanatory memorandum and in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech—that, as a matter of government policy, the usual regulatory impact assessment requirements would also apply. This is very important. This is not a factor that is detailed in the bill. It is, however, a factor that has been used time and again as reassurance. I would invite the parliamentary secretary, when he makes some remarks in this debate, again to provide that assurance from the government as to what will underpin that regulatory impact assessment process so that this debate has those issues clearly on the record, especially given that the website of the Office of Best Practice Regulation within the Department of Finance and Deregulation simply explains that a regulatory impact statement is required under the Australian government's requirements. That is one of those nice circular statements. We, of course, would just like, for the sake of conclusion in this debate, to ensure that the government's expectations and understanding of how that regulatory impact statement arrangement will work in this legislation are made clear so that all those who may be dealing with it in years to come have a clear record to refer back to in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I just raise another matter that I invite the parliamentary secretary to respond to and that I have foreshadowed with him. Very late in the inquiry into this bill, the Senate committee received a late submission from the Law Council of Australia—the Intellectual Property Committee of its Business Law Section—concerning the creation of product stewardship logos under the voluntary product stewardship provisions. As the committee did not have an opportunity to consider in detail the issues raised but simply drew it to the government's attention, I would invite the parliamentary secretary to provide advice on how the government has considered that issue and what advice he has received from the Attorney-General's Department or others about its relevance.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I once again express my thanks to all parties for their cooperation on this and restate the coalition's commitment to this scheme, to the principle of product stewardship and, importantly, to our belief that wherever possible these should be schemes driven and owned by industry to make sure that they have genuine stewardship of their products throughout the life cycle.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I also rise to make some remarks on the Product Stewardship Bill 2011 on behalf of the Australian Greens. This is framework legislation that arises from COAG agreeing that the federal government and the states and territories should together establish a national framework to support voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product steward­ship and extended producer responsibility schemes to responsibly manage the enor­mous quantities of waste that Australians are generating. This national approach is the kind of policy infrastructure that is necessary to separate contaminating products and valuable products and massively reduce our landfill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Facts and figures about how we currently handle our waste stream make the case as to why this measure is well and truly overdue. As I have said in committee hearings time and again, on this issue and on related issues that I will touch on, this is a policy portfolio for patient people. This really seems to have taken an inordinate amount of time to come to fruition, and I would like to congratulate the parliamentary secretary for steering us through these final phases, because this is genuinely well overdue. It is often very difficult to detect a sense of urgency amongst policymakers where waste is concerned, because of course historically it has been cheaper to simply dump our trash on a pile than to do something about the extraordinary waste of resources and, of course, the contamination at landfill sites, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution and so on that result—the hidden costs of the enormous profligacy of our consumer society. So it is good to at last be able to say that we can detect the faint stirrings of urgency. Australia uses over 12 billion beverage containers a year, for example. Only about half of those are recycled. Most of the remainder wind up as litter or in landfill. More than four billion plastic bags are given out at supermarkets. Barely any of those are recycled. Four million tonnes of packaging is used and discarded every year. Australians accumulate 18 million used tyres every year. Approx­imately four million tyres are landfilled every year, despite each tyre containing recyclable quantities, up to 1½ kilograms, of steel, half a kilogram of textile and seven kilos of rubber. And instead of responsibly dealing with our tyres, roughly 11 million, or about 60 per cent of them, are exported to Vietnam and China, where they are recycled—if you could call it that—under appalling labour conditions with really quite harmful environmental and public health impacts. In a portfolio where the crossbenches and the opposition support the moves that the government is making, I might call Senator Birmingham's attention, before we go too much further down the track of celebrating the importance of the RIS process, to the fact that this is one instance where a regulatory impact statement was undertaken. Through a process of arcane number-crunching, the economists decided that it was not worth bothering setting up any kind of product stewardship framework for tyres, so now we dump them in countries in our region where they are burnt and 'recycled', with enormously harmful conse­quences for host populations. So I think we need to be extremely cautious before we simply hand over the kind of policy-making decisions we are elected to provide to people with spreadsheets who will just plug a formula in and then two years later a result will fall out that says, 'Don't bother.' That is what happened in the instance of tyres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mobile phones, of course, are another nightmare. We have about 24 million in circulation in Australia as at 30 June 2010 in the hands of 70 per cent, or thereabouts, of Australians. They get replaced very often. I am convinced somewhere within each mobile phone there is a piece of software that says, 'Just before the next model is due to hit the market, this one will start getting flaky and then drop dead.' Again, that is a part of our consumer society that we need to draw attention to. We are getting very used to just taking these devices on and then, 20 minutes after they have been released, we feel like we are falling off the back of the curve and we turf them, and they wind up in landfill. Eighteen months to two years is the speed of product turnover in mobile phone markets. There are about 16 million old handsets in cupboards and drawers in Australian homes. Each one of these phones contains substances that we could contemplate as either being extremely hazardous, such as cadmium, lead, nickel, mercury, lithium, arsenic, or being valuable, such as metals like gold, silver and copper and plastics that can be shredded and reused as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The MobileMuster is a voluntary scheme, and here again is one example of why we had better be careful before we simply assume that the best solution across the board is for industry to just take care of these things itself. I appreciate the efforts of the people behind the MobileMuster. They have got 3½ thousand collection points around Australia and people can recycle their mobile phones by post. But the fact is—and the minister might like to contradict this figure, but it is the figure I have—we have about a five per cent recovery rate in that voluntary scheme. That is another way of saying we have a 95 per cent non-recovery rate of phones that find themselves in landfill or just wind up in drawers for all time, not being recycled and that material lost to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From November 1998 to 30 June 2010, 724 tonnes, including five-and-a-bit million handsets and batteries, were junked. Quite a bit of that can be recycled from the old mobile phones. The nickel in the batteries can be recovered, as can the gold and silver in the circuit boards, and the handset housings and casings can be used to make fence posts, pallets and other things that we make with recycled plastics. I was interested to read in the MobileMuster annual report that one tonne of mobile phone circuit boards can yield the same amount of precious metals as 110 tonnes of gold ore or 123 tonnes of silver-bearing ore and 11 tonnes of copper sulphide ore. So these things are valuable and we need somehow to figure out how to recover that material, and this obviously goes further than just what happens at the end of life. We need to look at the design and manufacture of these devices in the first place so that they are designed to be more easily disassembled. As one of the witnesses to the committee said, even if all the mobile phones that are being stored came out for recycling, MobileMuster does not have the infrastructure to take hold of those and recycle them. I will return to this as an interesting example where the industry has taken on itself to try and do the right thing, but it has not been sufficient, you would say, to actually come to grips with the overall scale of the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where there is better news is in the area of televisions, computers and so on, involving Product Stewardship Australia and the Australian Information Industry Association, which Senator Birmingham touched on. There we have industry peak bodies that have taken the lead based, I understand, on moves overseas. We are in a global market here and other countries are moving ahead. This is one quite clear-cut example where you can say industry has led from the front in requesting that the government take on and regulate for the entire industry so that people who want to do the right thing are not being competitively disadvantaged by free-riders. It looks as though we are in the process of getting that one right. There were 16.8 million televisions, computers and peripherals that died in 2008. Eighty per cent of those went to landfill; about 10 per cent were recycled. As the digital switchover occurs, as the NBN rolls out, and we know we are undergoing an enormous face of technological innovation in Australia at the moment, that pile of electronic or e-waste is only going to grow into a mountain. That is why it is good to notice that a focus on TVs and computers is welcome as the first scheme, otherwise we would be debating effectively empty legislation—a container bill with nothing in it. But we know that we do have an example of how this framework legislation will be used, and that is welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we do not get going with that properly, e-waste in Australian landfill will triple by 2020 and be close to 700 million items. That is an extraordinary waste of this material that we all know can be quite transitory as product cycles accelerate. As it is, there are 18 million TVs and 70 million computers and peripherals in landfill or on their way to landfill. These constitute about 38 per cent of current e-waste items in landfill. We know that we need to deal with items like fluorescent tubes, some of which contain mercury, and items like batteries that find their way into landfill and then pose enormous problems with water contam­ination as water percolates through the landfill piles and into local watertables. There is a good news story here about how many jobs, for example, would be created if we dealt responsibly with our waste. The Boomerang Alliance stated that a national recycling scheme for all e-waste would create 5,100 new jobs by 2015. That includes 1,440 direct jobs in the recycling of e-waste and another 3,660 indirect jobs. As Senators will know, I have been pushing for quite some time for a national container deposit scheme to handle the 12 billion beverage containers that are used in this country. If we put monetary value on those containers, we would see many fewer of them end up in our waterways, parks and bushland. So, just as we propose to tax carbon emissions so that the market suddenly sees a price signal on something that we do not want to throw away, we would be placing a tiny premium on the beverage container to give them an economic value. That, in effect, would reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly one million tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> per year. That is the equivalent of switching 135,000 homes to 100 per cent renewable energy. All that is based on is the 50-odd per cent of beverage containers that at the moment find their way into streams, the side of the road and landfill, the stuff that we buy, use and discard when we are away from home where recycling rates are obviously very poor. It is about bringing those into the system and recovering those materials—a million tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would save enough water to perman­ently supply more than 30,000 Australian homes. Because we would no longer be discarding the stuff, we would be getting those materials back. It would deliver air quality improvements equivalent to taking 56,000 cars off the road and create approximately 1,000 direct jobs. Our bev­erage containers made up, we are aware, of about 60 per cent of all glass items, 47 per cent of metal items and about a third of plastic items during the 2010 Clean Up Australia Day. Nine out of the top 10 items collected on that day were packaging materials which made up about 80 per cent of all waste collected. This is a huge volume of material at the moment simply going to waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is broad, consistent and very high support in the community for a container deposit scheme. There is a demonstrated willingness to pay. The study was done twice, and now we are buried in the swamp of a regulatory impact statement process being undertaken by the Commonwealth on container deposits that simply has this proposal buried in quicksand. It is not good enough. At best, we think this could result in a scheme being implemented in four years time. Thanks to this analysis paralysis, we have to get faster and better and develop a sense of urgency when something is so obviously a good idea. For every 12 months that we drag our heels on this, another 12 billion beverage containers are used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 25 January this year, Northern Territory Chief Minister Paul Henderson put out a blazing press statement calling on the beverage industry to stop their misleading campaign against the cash for containers legislation. It is one of the sharpest pieces of language I think I have ever seen come out of a Premier's or Chief Minister's office where he said that the beverage industry should simply stop wasting its money on deceptive advertising to stop it. How different the situation is when we have got the industry peaks in the case of e-waste, computers and TVs backing a scheme and demanding coherent legislation for their sector and so of course things are moving. The case of the beverage industry could not be in starker contrast where they have dug their heels in and progress has been painfully slow because of the deceptive conduct of the beverage and packaging industries. I still do not completely understand why the hostility is so stark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have put these figures on the record to make the point that national approaches to our national waste crisis are very much needed. We have historically had a very weak response to this issue in Australia. We have got litter campaigns which are valuable: they marshal volunteers and get people out to pick material up. We have got industry-led voluntary programs that are limited in extent and need some kind of coherent framework and approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main industry government program is of course the Australian Packaging Covenant, which sounds great but it does not really deliver as much as industry seems to think, despite what we continually hear about in the course of various pieces of committee work that have contributed to this debate. We acknowledge the benefits of the APC, but I do not think they are as great as some in industry believe that they are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have very serious concerns at the extent to which voluntary schemes are emphasised at the expense of mandatory schemes in this bill. I know there is some kind of reflexive opposition on the coalition side to forms of mandatory regulation where a voluntary industry scheme might serve us better. We believe that the amendments that have been jointly negotiated between the Greens, the government and the opposition will sharpen the distinctions between the three kinds of schemes that this bill seeks to bring into force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that if a voluntary program has sufficient resources and organisational capacity then infrastructure can be developed and the outcomes can be very strong. What this bill, I think, will do with a bit of goodwill—and I am happy if the minister wants to confirm this—is put some teeth into the voluntary schemes. Let's hear what the targets are and, if they are not being met, then let's review them and assess whether a scheme should maybe shift from being voluntary to co-regulatory. If a co-regulatory scheme is letting us down, then let's assess if those targets are failing to be met; let's move it up to a mandatory scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Co-regulatory programs work when the industry wants them to, and I am very happy to give credit where it is due to the television and computer industry who obviously want to do something about their waste, as I say, driven by international imperatives to bring our extraordinary waste production under control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have worked with the government to ensure that the bill does not use federal powers to extinguish good state schemes. I would hate to see, for example, a defective container deposit scheme get up that squashed the good work that has been done in South Australia over the last 30 years or the initiative taken by the Northern Territory. We will be asking the government, when we drop into the committee stage, to clarify how that is going to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also worked constructively to address an issue that came up during the committee inquiry into the bill regarding the need for the minister to have some guidance and input from experts to help identify priorities and monitor progress and next steps. I think that is something that every single witness who came before the committee said should happen and I am glad that we have government and, I think, opposition support for those amendments by the Australian Greens to set the priorities. Such an advisory panel existed to guide the New South Wales product stewardship legislation. The independent committee in New South Wales was made up of experts, non-government organisations and industry reps. That was involved in establishing a list of priority products so that industry knew where the system was going and the prioritisation process was transparent for the community. That advice was offered on an ongoing basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also, when we get to the committee stage, make amendments to the objects clause of the bill that we think is very important, and I will discuss that shortly. I would like to thank the committee for its excellent and very useful report that provided a very useful distillation of the waste crisis in our country. We perhaps take our committee staff here for granted from time to time because of how regularly they astound us by their professionalism and efficiency but this report, I think, actually stands out. I would also like to thank the non-government organisations who work very hard in an, I suppose, unglamorous area of waste policy. It is work that is nonetheless extraordinarily important for the larger project of creating a genuinely sustainable Australia, for cleaning up our act, for cleaning up our fouled waterways, our parklands and our wilderness from rubbish and for recovering those valuable materials that go to waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge my colleague in Victoria Colleen Hartland MLC, who I think today is reintroducing in the Victorian parliament her bill on container deposits because she shares the frustration of many people in this place that the Commonwealth has simply decided to bury a national container deposit scheme under endless reviews and analysis. Colleen my colleague in the Victorian parliament and her office have done an enormous amount of work in building support in Victoria for a state scheme. I still think that a national scheme is the right way to go and I suspect that industry would prefer a coherent set of regulations that applied across the country, but I really strongly commend Colleen Hartland MLC for bringing her bill forward to simply get on with the job of getting containers out of waterways and verges and into recycling centres where they belong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great benefits of a container deposit scheme is that it would mandate and fund the creation of a network of neighbourhood recycling centres. Once you get those up and running for beverage containers initially they become the drop-off point for batteries, fluorescent tubes and other objects that we might find intractable that simply end up in landfill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would again like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, for the constructive way in which he has approached this bill. It is always good to get an exposure draft of a bill so that you can see where a particular area is headed. I would like to thank all sides for the constructive spirit in which negotiations were entered into for this bill. It is a rare bit of good news. I would like to see this, very strictly speaking, as the first step of many. This simply sets us up with a framework which will be free to succeed or fail depending on the amount of effort and energy that is put into it. I look forward to discussing some of these matters in greater detail in the committee stage and indicate that the Greens are happy to support the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  Now you would not necessarily know it from the title of the Product Stewardship Bill but, yes, this bill is largely about waste and largely about the management of it. So why have we wasted so much time in getting to this point? Why have we wasted so much time when the Howard government supported the concept of a national scheme to reduce the impact on the environment and on health and safety of products and substances during their life and then at the end of their life? The Howard government supported that principle and that concept yet it is some years upon years later that we finally find ourselves in this place in the noncontroversial section of the legislative consideration hopefully poised to give passage and implement such a scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has it taken so long? Why have we wasted so long in working out what to do nationally with our waste when, for example, the television and computer industry, largely composed of manufacturers and importers wanting to do the right thing, has recognised that we still use TVs with hazardous substances in them and we need to take TVs and computers off the footpath and get them out of landfill? That industry is one that has been working for a long time towards an industry resourced national scheme. The unnecessary distress caused to that industry and its largely well-meaning and hardworking people, when it needs some legislative enablement to get its scheme up and running before the end of this year, because this government has left its run until the 11th hour is indeed regrettable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we are about to be at a happier place in terms of the bill. Thanks to the departmental officers, and Ms Kelly Pearce and Dr Wright in particular, for their constructive engagement with us as members of the opposition, under of course the fine tutelage of the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, Senator Farrell. Thank you for your consideration of our views but also those views of industry. Taking so long in the gestation of what to do with our waste, the government claimed it had extensively consulted with industry last year culminating in the putting out of the discussion paper, which the government tried to say resulted in a whole lot of submissions as the precursor to this bill. The problem is that the government dumped—talk about waste—this bill in the House of Reps in March this year without having the forethought, the preparedness to release an exposure draft of the bill. It dumped the bill on the House of Reps in March and then thankfully, it decided to refer it to a Senate committee for inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But having referred a bill of that sort to a Senate committee inquiry without the benefit of an exposure draft, the man in the street would not know what product stewardship is when it is at home. Most people would not know. The man in the street would not know it if he fell over it. So it was all very nice for us to get excited as members of the Senate committee and say, 'Whoopee, we are having an inquiry into this bill, so it will all be sorted.' The trouble is even some of the stakeholders involved in the process through government last year were caught unawares by the inquiry and indeed the relevance of this bill to them and their industries. Product stewardship has existed as a term, no doubt, in the industry, bureaucratic and probably government vernacular for quite some time but, as I say, the normal man or woman in the street would not know it if they fell over it. The Senate Environment and Communica­tions Legislation Committee inquiry heard from a range of witnesses, who did realise that product stewardship had some consequences for them and their respective industries. They drove home mainly two messages: firstly, that the criteria that a product or substance has to meet before being able to be subject to the voluntary co-regulatory or mandatory regime set up by the bill were so wide you could drive a truck through them—the department did a very brave job giving evidence and suggesting that the criteria were filters, but in my warped interpretation of the English language filters reduce things that come through the other end and the trouble with these criteria is they do none of that—and, secondly, the bill gives industry no practical place to start. It potentially says that every product and every substance under the sun—indeed, every product on the supermarket shelf, so said witnesses—is potentially subject to this bill. Those in industry want to do the right thing, but they know not where to start as the bill gives no suggestion—in the language of some witnesses, 'Pick the low-hanging fruit; please suggest where we might start.' It leaves industry swinging in a stewardship wasteland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, following the Senate inquiry, as I said, the government has taken quite some note of the Senate committee's report and that has resulted in discussions taking place. It also resulted, very importantly, in belated consultations with industry stake­holders including between the government and industry stakeholders. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry became far more involved in consideration of the bill and was able to contribute constructively in where we find ourselves today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In looking forward to supporting the bill and supporting a range of amendments that have been tabled and circulated, I also hope that the government will learn some lessons from this process. This should be and will be not only a bipartisan but a tripartisan or a quadruple-partisan policy. It is a good thing, but just because something sounds good does not mean that it will do good unless you make sure that you implement it the right way. That means—please, government, and please, Senator Farrell—that the message for your colleagues is explain things to the people, to the stakeholders, consult with the stakeholders and do as the Prime Minister says: let the damn sunshine in. We are all deprived of vitamin D these days, did you know? Let the sunlight in; do not leave it to the last minute to consult with those who could help you achieve a constructive outcome.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I thank all the contributors to this debate on the Product Stewardship Bill, particularly Senators Birmingham, Fisher and Ludlam. I noted the complimentary remarks from Senators Fisher and Ludlam, but really the credit should go to my staff and also to the people from the department, Diana Wright and Kelly Pearce, who have worked so hard to ensure that this legislation passes the parliament. It is reassuring that we have had such strong support and such strong cooperation from the opposition and the Greens so that we get a more effective and consistent approach to reducing the impact of products and hazardous substances in products on the environment and on human health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Birmingham raised a couple of issues, which I would like to specifically address. The first related to the regulatory impact statement. The bill sits within a strong governance framework that encourages consultation and evidence based decision making. Before any decision to regulate a product can be made, a regulatory impact analysis is required. As explained in paragraph 19 of the explanatory memoran­dum, this is both government and COAG policy. The regulatory impact analysis is a robust process that articulates the problems to be addressed. It assesses not only the economic but also the social and environ­mental benefits and costs in taking action to address a particular problem. There is no preconception that a particular solution like product stewardship is the best approach; a range of options is considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact analysis process typically involves significant consultation. For example, the television and computers con­sultation regulatory impact statement was released and public meetings were run—also a requirement to publish the results of this process. Once a decision to regulate is made, taking into account the impact analysis in section 17, the Legislative Instruments Act requires consultations on the regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Birmingham raised the letter that the Law Council sent to the committee. The letter raised the issue of use of the logo to support accreditation of voluntary schemes and, in particular, the interaction of the bill with the Trade Marks Act. In essence, the Law Council's concern was that the bill duplicates elements of the Trade Marks Act dealing with what are known as certification trademarks. These provisions in the Trade Marks Act allow, for example, a body like the Heart Foundation to register the Heart Foundation tick and certify that certain goods meet the Heart Foundation's standards. I have sought advice from my department and, through the department, from IP Australia on this matter. I am advised that the bill complements rather than duplicates the Trade Marks Act provisions. In fact, it is anticipated that the product stewardship logo would be required as a certification trademark under the Trade Marks Act, which I hope answers Senator Birmingham's question. Without any further discussion, I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>): The first amendment that the Australian Greens will move on sheet 7078 is a very simple addition to the objects clause in the Products Stewardship Bill 2011 to make explicit that the scope of product stewardship legislation should rightly be:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought that was a reasonably commonsense thing to insert in a bill such as this to make absolutely explicit what this is about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to do a number of things. In respect of the recovery of material and taking this material out of landfill, what we are trying to do here is then plug that material back into product cycles. I think there is a very well understood principle of industrial ecology or cradle-to-cradle product cycles, which says that if you are recovering valuable materials you want to then close those loops and plug that material back into the product cycle so that you are actually reducing the impact of manufacturing in the first place on the raw materials and on the virgin materials that we mine, chop down, refine and so on. So we wish to put a clause into the objects section of the bill because we believe a very important part of the whole enterprise of recycling and encouraging responsible products stewardship is that it reduces the amount of materials being drawn on to create the product in the first place. While the bill will not have a huge impact on the front end of creating the products, and I understand that is not specifically its intention, it is mostly focused on the end of pipe—it is focused on waste and what falls out of the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One overall, quite obvious and uncontro­versial aim I would have thought of doing this work is to impact on the way these products are made in the first place. That is obviously a piece of legislation for another day and, if anything, that is even more complex than what we are contemplating here. But I do not think that there is any harm at all—quite the reverse—in inserting a clause into the objects of the bill that at least tips the hat and acknowledges the fact that as we are in the business today in this parlia­ment of recovering materials in the first place, that those materials then be used at the front end. We are trying to encourage recycling. We believe that it should have an intent of impacting on the way that products are made in the first place, so we can take the first tentative steps in Australia towards a closed-loop economy or closed-loop product cycles.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  This amendment by the Greens to add clause (c) to the objects of the Product Stewardship Bill 2011 is certainly a well-intentioned amendment and the spirit of the amendment is in some ways difficult to disagree with. Certainly it is a statement that we would hope would be an outcome ultimately of product stewardship schemes in the operation of this act and that there would eventually be, as a result of product stewardship schemes, a reduction in the amount of virgin resources used in product through a higher use of recycled materials. That is something we would hope and expect. This bill will provide for product stewardship schemes that will see, we would hope and expect, an increase in the amount of materials recycled at the end of product, and obviously those products or those materials will be recycled into some other products and will be a substitute for virgin resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we do not see that there is a need to add this extra part to the objects of the bill, and we do not see that there is a need for a couple of reasons. The objects as they currently stand certainly do not exclude this as a point of consideration. Subclause (1)(a) of the objects is to reduce the impact that products have on the environment throughout their lives and subclause (1)(b) is to reduce the impact that substances con­tained in products have on the environ­ment and on the health and safety of human beings throughout the lives of those products. Neither of those subclauses exclude, I think, what Senator Ludlam is attempting to achieve by virtue of paragraph (c). Indeed, both are relatively broad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would make the additional point that of course there are some circular aspects of this act in terms of the way products are accredited for their application. To have a scheme accredited, to have a product stewardship scheme applied, there is a criterion where the minister deems that doing so will meet the objects of the act. That means, that in addition to the product stewardship criteria, which we will debate in a second, the objects are one of the two tests. Obviously, if you inserted paragraph (c) to the objects, there would be a new, additional test for consideration. I suspect that this would not be Senator Ludlam's intent, but it would be possible that, in the way the bill is written at present, all objects would have to be met for something to be accredited, and that would mean that paragraph (c) would have to be met along with paragraphs (a) and (b).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That may not be the case for some schemes that people would wish to accredit. In fact, in particular, when we were working through the product stewardship criteria, we found the importance of issues around hazardous substances and the need for this bill to comply with Australia's international obligations in the treatment of hazardous substances. These are not necessarily substances that will be recycled, and certainly not substances that will be recycled in a manner that would displace the use of virgin resources in making other products. This is simply a way of ensuring that a scheme is in place for the safe and sound management of hazardous substances. I think there is a potential risk that by inserting the proposed paragraph (c) as one of the objects we could create a trip-up within this legislation that would impede its effective operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the reasons that we think the intentions are good but they are by no means excluded by the existing objects and we think there could be some inadvertent issues with the operation of the bill were it to be passed with this amendment, the coalition will not be supporting the amendment. But we hope and expect that, as I said, the sentiments in the amendment are an actual outcome of the operation of this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  In addition to the shortcomings identified by Senator Birmingham, I will identify a couple of further ones within this very well-intentioned amendment moved by Senator Ludlam. I am sure that the Greens, and Senator Ludlam in particular, know what is meant in the amendment when it refers to reducing the amount of virgin resources used in products by preferencing recyclate, but neither 'virgin' nor 'recyclate' are terms that are defined in the bill. No doubt the Greens have a concept of 'virgin resources'. Indeed, Senator Hanson-Young once did an advertisement, I think, around that concept, but in a slightly different context. So, whilst the Greens might be clear on what they mean by 'virgin resources' and 'recyclate', those terms are not defined in the bill. That would add additional uncertainty and potential unintended consequences, as Senator Birmingham outlined. The amendment is very well intentioned, but we will oppose it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  You know you are in trouble when you get called 'well intentioned'. That was when my heart sank. I thought perhaps there would be a last-minute change of heart. I would be delighted to work with coalition senators on definitions. Senator Fisher is correct that these are not terms of art—they are not defined in the bill. They are concepts that are very clearly understood in the industry, in the waste management sector in particular. If Senator Fisher feels that some definitions would improve the drafting, I would be more than happy to work up some language to make her happy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw the chamber's attention back to when this issue was addressed by the committee as it was evaluating this bill. A number of organisations, particularly Keep Australia Beautiful New South Wales and the Total Environment Centre, raised significant concerns with explicitly men­tioning this. I suppose I have to disagree with both the comments of Senator Birmingham and the parliamentary secretary that these objectives are implied in the existing objects of the bill, because of course the existing objects of the bill refer principally to what happens at the end of life of the materials that we are discussing. They are silent, as they are on many other issues, on the implied consequences of creating new product streams, new resource streams, of material that we are capturing rather than simply throwing away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, Keep Australia Beautiful New South Wales highlighted that one of the ongoing trends in the production of modern goods is their reducing life span. I addressed this in my speech on the second reading in the context of mobile phones. Quite an important part of the enormously increasing waste volumes that we are subject to and are trying to come to grips with here today is this concept of planned obsolescence, the throwaway or consumer society, where it is seen as a very good marketing strategy to get your customers to throw goods away so that they have to buy the new ones that you have produced. That is directly at odds with all sane objectives for creating a sustainable society. It would not matter so much if they were contemplating goods that were essentially biodegradable, completely harmless and made from recycled materials in the first place, but of course, in the instance of mobile phones and so on, that is absolutely not the case. Mobile phones are packed with toxic materials, valuable metals and so on that we would seek to recover. We would seek not to stockpile them in a warehouse but to reuse them. Keep Australia Beautiful New South Wales made the point very clearly that modern consumers will simply throw a product onto a kerb side for council to clean up and buy a brand-new one because the parts are too expensive or too difficult to find. We know in the field of consumer electronics in particular that things that are made these days are designed not to be repairable; when something goes wrong you are supposed to turf it. That is quite a troubling feature of our consumer society. Keep Australia Beautiful highlighted in their submission that when you produce any type of product, there is a set amount of energy and resources that are used and the longer the product is used, the better return on the embodied energy and input of resources. If you can make something last twice as long, its impact, its footprint if you will, is obviously half as heavy. They recommended that the objects of the act be amended to ensure that the lifespan of a product be considered for its impact on waste streams in the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you will see from the language that we have proposed, we did not quite go there. But we did simply want to insert a paragraph that acknowledges the importance of closing those loops. The Total Environment Centre, who have done an enormous amount of valuable advocacy on this issue over many years, argued more strongly for language that we effectively lifted and proposed—that is, that we should be making a contribution to reducing the amount of 'virgin resources used in products by preferencing recyclate'. It does not go as far as to raise the concerns that Senator Birmingham spoke of—that is, that various products streams will find themselves at odds with this object of the bill if all you were seeking to do, for example, is simply to remove hazardous waste for which you have no further use. It is a contribution to reducing the amount, and I do not think we would face the problem of particular product streams falling foul of the object of the bill when it is worded as generally as that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The TEC argued that in addition to the benefit of limiting the amount of new resources used in creating a product, expanding the objects of the Act would have the effect of encouraging the domestic recycling industry …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that is tremendously important that is continually missed in the processes of doing the regulatory impact statements. TEC told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You create a market for the recyclate and that leads to very significant economic benefits. The fact is that for every tonne of waste that goes to landfill there is one job, but if you take it right through the whole processing and manufacturing system and include that recyclate in a product you create nine jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is modelling that the Total Environment Centre and some of their colleagues in the waste management industry have been promoting for many, many years—that is, it is more labour intensive but less capital intensive to simply close some of these product loops in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee noted those concerns and came to the view, as I think the minister has stated, that the objects of the bill, while silent in this particular aspect, imply that we should reduce the impact of these virgin resources and instead be preferencing recyclate, for both environmental reasons and sound economic reasons. If you can plug these materials back into product cycles, then again you have created an economic value for them that the market will see, will take note of and will overall reduce the footprint of material cycles. I invite the coalition, if they will, to sharpen the definitions of the materials that Senator Fisher observed are not terms addressed or acknowledged specifically in the bill, and I commend this amendment to the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment seeks to replace section 5 of the bill. Section 5 outlines the product stewardship criteria and was a section that was the subject of intense debate and concern during the Senate committee inquiry into this bill. As drafted, section 5 'Product stewardship criteria' states that the criteria are satisfied in relation to a class of products if two or more of a range of paragraphs apply. Those paragraphs are, in some cases, quite broad when compared to the objects of the bill that we have just been discussing. These criteria, as drafted, include a statement that 'the products are in a national market' and a statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… taking action to reduce those impacts will offer business opportunities that would make a contribution to the economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They would have been two criteria in the bill that would be satisfied, and obviously for those who looked at it and thought this was an extremely broad way to apply criteria and a way that did not necessarily ensure that criteria were applied to ensure that the overriding intention and objects of this bill, which of course are to reduce environmental impacts, to better conserve materials and to ensure an increase in recycling, were the core criteria that had to be met with regard to the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I did in my second reading debate speech, I thank the government in particular as well the Greens for working with us on redrafting these criteria and coming up with a tighter, neater form of criteria for the bill, which I believe the amendment does. The amendment provides that products will meet the criteria. Firstly, they must be in a national market and, secondly, they have to meet one of three other criteria. The first, namely that they contain hazardous substances, relates to some of the issues I discussed in regard to Senator Ludlam's amendment. Of course there are chemical substances that we do wish to better regulate and better manage the treatment of, either by Australia's own initiative or as a result of compliance with international obligations, and this legislation could provide a framework to do so. The other two criteria relate very specifically to the objects of reducing environmental impact, achieving better re-use of materials or conservation of materials and minimising the impact or use of those virgin materials that we were just discussing. The other two parts a product category would have to meet have been drawn from the words used in the original section 5 to ensure that we have not thrown the baby out with the bathwater in regard to all of the good consultation that the government did with industry and others with regard to working through the types of words and phrases. But they do ensure that products regulated by this legislation will have to significantly increase the conserva­tion of materials or significantly reduce the impact that the products have on the environment or on health or safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have very clear tests now. There are essentially three ways for a scheme to be accredited under this legislation: the products contain hazardous substances; there is the potential to significantly increase the conservation of materials used in the products, or increase the recovery of resources from waste from the products; or there is the potential to significantly reduce the impact that the products have on the environment, or that substances in the products have on the environment, or on the health or safety of human beings. These are three very distinct criteria. Under the amendment, one of them will have to be met. I know that it does not totally satisfy all of the concerns of industry or of those who wanted a very prescriptive criteria standard to apply, but I think it provides a far more certain criteria framework, a very clear test that has to be met. In applying that test, the parliament can have far greater confidence that this bill and the operation of this bill and the application of regulations under this bill will actually achieve what we all believe to be the objects of introducing a product stewardship bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the amendment to the chamber. I thank in advance the other parties for their cooperation. This amendment works in tandem in a sense with some other amendments that form part of a package that we have all agreed upon to ensure better operation of this bill and of course to ensure the passage of this bill. I will be happy to address any other issues that may be raised by Senator Ludlam or the parliamentary secretary.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  I indicate at the outset that the Australian Greens will be supporting this amendment. When it was first proposed, or perhaps when some of the arguments were being tested during the committee process, I had some strong concerns about where the coalition was heading. Senator Fisher, I think, raised on a number of occasions the idea that ultimately product stewardship frameworks could be applied to nearly anything at all. Senator Fisher and other coalition MPs at the time were stating that with a sense of horror, as though it would be a terrible thing if many products which are familiar and in everyday use were to be discarded and then find their way into this framework legislation at some stage. I fail to see why that would necessarily be a bad thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, however, argued in their additional comments that the product stewardship criteria be reworked. I will acknowledge that every witness, with the exception of the department, who came in front of the committee said it is very difficult to detect where the government is heading with this. No priorities have been set. We have no idea whether this is intended to cover the field. How do we know that you are going to go after what some described as the low-hanging fruit or whether you are going to tie us up in going through regulatory impact statements and so on for products that are not necessarily at the top of the list for a product stewardship scheme? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are convinced that there are grounds for this. We welcome this amend­ment. I acknowledge that we fought for a little while over the term 'significantly'. I think if that ends up being addressed as too harsh a test by the government—and I invite the parliamentary secretary to address this issue specifically—we may end up finding that nothing finds its way into the scheme, if we are not careful. I know that that is not the government's intention. But I also acknowledge the way that some of the witnesses put this; we are in effect taking it on trust that the political will is there to move products into this framework so that we can actually start to reduce waste volumes in a serious way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support criteria that capture all of the potential products that might be appropriate for a scheme like this. I understand the opposition's intention is not to needlessly exclude products that we could usefully pull out of landfill or off the side of the road. They need to have clear meaning. I think it was successfully argued by coalition senators that indeed nearly anything at all could have found its way into this framework. That contributed to the unease expressed by people in industry and by non-government organisations that work on improving waste policy—opposite ends of the spectrum. There was no sense at all about where the government was going to take this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In evidence given to the committee, Mr Jeff Angel from the Total Environment Centre was asked whether ministerial discretion would set appropriate boundaries or whether in fact this framework would end up applying to every substance and every conceivable product. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What in this bill makes it apply to everything? On paper everything; in practice potentially nothing, as I have outlined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could set this framework up and, if it were not for the good work that is being done in the e-waste area, I would be very sceptical as to the value of this bill at all. Mr Angel went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So it will be somewhere in the middle, or somewhere closer to not very many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is: not very many product streams are going to find their way into this framework. He continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Knowing how government processes work, how government regulatory assessments work, how industry negotiates and how we have had to work on the various committees, in reality it does not apply to everything. Frankly, I think it is the sort of fiction that puts the bill in a completely wrong perspective and light. What legislation makes everything happen unless it says that everything is going to come under it? It is a discretionary exercise and discretion in ministerial and government terms is very bounded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from the point of view of groups like the Total Environment Centre, which are obviously concerned to see the maximum value and the maximum benefit gained. In some contexts, that might mean that a very wide variety of products wind up in this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Food and Grocery Council took a slightly different perspective on it during the same hearing, but effectively arrived at the same conclusion. Mr Mahar from the Australian Food and Grocery Council said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… based on the broad interpretation. While we support that, our concern is that it leaves too much scope opportunity for secondary regulations to be made in relation to a range of products that are not necessarily compatible with product stewardship schemes or do not lend themselves to arrangements, mandatory or otherwise, that can be implemented under that bill. In our view the criteria currently in the bill are too broad, too wide and too numerous to allow any certainty for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Somewhere between those two perspectives there is a range of views that I think all witnesses were very consistent on, which said, 'We need a process here for a prioritisation,' and the coalition, I think, took the view that one way of guiding the government's discretion in that area is to narrow the range of criteria to which this kind of scheme can apply. We think that that is entirely appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will support this bill, but I would seek for the minister, in his remarks before we close debate on this amendment, to address his understanding of the term 'significantly' as the government intends it to apply to the way that the criteria will be used.</span>

We then had to have the discussion as to whether to apply it as a test to both or to neither. In the end the coalition felt it is important to apply it to both. We would not want to see a situation where, especially, co-regulatory or mandatory schemes were put in place if there were only a marginal benefit. I guess that is where we would draw the distinction. We do not see that 'significantly' is a gargantuan test to leap over, but we see it as a way of making sure that we are not entering a realm where it is within the scope of this legislation to apply schemes that would only be of negligible or marginal benefit rather than of a reasonable or significant benefit.</span>

But I suspect it will be quite a period of time before that harvest and bounty is picked. These definitions, as applied, and the use of the word 'significantly' will ensure that we have consistency in the definitions and will ensure that where schemes are being applied they do actually make a difference; a tangible difference that people can see and that will therefore will help to improve the support and embrace of those schemes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  Obviously, in speaking in support of the amendment I look forward to it enabling the picking of more than just low-hanging fruit. Indeed, feeding into the low-hanging fruit part of the equation is probably best achieved by amendments which we will discuss shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is tightening the criteria so that they can indeed do as Dr Wright suggested was the government's intent during the inquiry into this bill—that is, to filter. The amendment ensures that the criteria now filter the flotsam and jetsam, if you like, of products and substances which otherwise could have been subject to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not quite the projection of mass hysteria implied by Senator Ludlam that came from some witnesses about the confusion that could result from the fact that the bill, in its current unamended termin­ology, could apply to every product and every substance. But there was significant concern, and for good practical reason. There is no point in having criteria or words in a bit of legislation if they are so wide as to cover everything and to be meaningless. Just as it is a waste to have words in legislation to that end, it is also a waste for any government, as would have been the consequence with the bill in its current terms, to potentially leave industry uncertain about the targets of a particular piece of legislation and the product stewardship regulatory regime which would result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government of the day will need the arms and legs of industry to get this cracking. You have only to look at the television and computer industries to see that. We are not going to get TVs off the footpath and out of landfill without the industry, be it in that case a co-regulatory scheme that is being proposed or be it in other sectors mandatory, co-regulatory and/or voluntary. Whatever the mechanism and whatever the means, the government of the day is going to be best placed to achieve its wishes with the cooperation, support and hard work of industry, and you had best get that, Temporary Chair Hutchins, as you would know from your hardworking days prior to coming to the Senate, from industry by getting them onboard on day 1 and getting them understanding and involved in the point that you are aiming at. So these amendments are good.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I was ultimately persuaded by arguments that coalition senators raised on the use of the word 'significantly', and I will ask the minister in a moment about where he sees this process going from here. I visualise the fact that anything that would lead to insignificant recovery of materials or recycling would not be worth anybody's while, so we were happy that that test remains in there. But I wonder whether, for the benefit of the chamber but also for the industry and the various sectors that will be intimately affected by the operation of this when it becomes an act, we could be told where this is heading next. What are the priorities? What are the low-hanging fruit? Where is this whole process going? At the moment, we have been speaking, apart from the instances of TVs, computers and so on, mostly in the abstract. I am interested in knowing where the parliamentary secretary sees this process going once this legislation clears the parliament.</span>

We have set up a mechanism to deal with that. That was all part of the discussions that we had. There will be a number of products which I think are likely to come on the radar very soon. The first is tyres. I think fluorescent lighting and packaging will be issues that will come up in the very near future. Of course, our priority is to ensure that we get the TV and computer program up and running. That is going to be our immediate priority.</span>

So as not to tie the chamber up, so we can move through the remainder of the amendments that we have, can the minister point me to somewhere on his website or the department's website—or indicate whether such a document exists as part of the COAG process—that has a list of what the various product types are. The parliamentary secretary named a couple at that point. Are they intended to be voluntary, co-regulatory or mandatory schemes? What recovery targets are anticipated for each of those product streams? When would they proposed to be met? I am not suggesting that the minister necessarily detail that unless he has that information at the table right now, but I would be very interested in knowing whether such a document exists in the first place and whether the parliamentary secretary and the officers at the table would undertake to create such a thing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second set of amendments introduces a product stewardship advisory group. This in many ways goes to the same issues that we have been dealing with so far this morning. It is an idea that was raised by quite a number of those making submissions to the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were two broad categories of reasons why the Australian Greens felt that this was a valid suggestion and something that would materially improve the way that the bill operates. The first is the lack of priorities established in the legislation that I think we have already canvassed in some detail. Industry and community groups who follow this process have absolutely no idea where it is due to head apart from some very broad-brush issues that the minister outlined there. The second is that the minister, under the way that this act will operate, has very broad powers without any particular accoun­tability mechanism or opportunity for input. So there is enormous discretion there to take issues on, to take various product streams on or not. Environment ministers obviously all get together within the EPHC and as an entity within the larger COAG process, which we find almost completely opaque because what goes on behind those closed doors can be very difficult to influence or even to know, in many cases, what the propositions are. Our amendments pick up the suggestions made by those in the sector who proposed that an advisory group would best comprise experts from industry groups, consumer advocates, community groups, environment groups and scientific groups who would be valuable in providing expert advice on new products that could potentially come under the framework legislation. That not only gives the government some guidance as to where the industry, in the broadest concept of that term, thinks that this process should go but also provides the minister and the community with that advice, that you have the experts around the table when these decisions are being made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of an expert panel was seen as providing forthright advice from outside the bureaucracy. This would be seen to strengthen the governance arrangements. This is nothing against the bureaucrats who have been managing this process to date, but we feel that diversity of opinion and having the experts in the room when the decisions are being made is a way of providing unfiltered advice to the government that can also generate and transmit a sense of urgency coming from the community for various things. For example, we are aware of media reporting a fortnight or so ago about four shipments of e-waste intercepted by Customs, presumably on their way to South-East Asia. That is not what the industry wants, it is not what people think is happening when their computers and televisions are picked up or they drop them off at a neighbourhood recycling centre, but it is still going on. For the government to be able to respond through this expert advisory group to changing circumstances or new information that arises, like the degree of a black market in e-waste shipping and dumping in some of our neighbouring countries, can guide the direction and help give a sense of urgency. WALGA, the Western Australian Local Government Association, said that a panel:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… would ensure that the most important products and those with the biggest potential to create an environmental impact were selected for product stewardship schemes. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I noted, this is a way of prioritising that has support from industry right through to the community groups and so on. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An example of such an advisory committee being established to manage waste and determine priorities is the statutory Waste Advisory Board in New Zealand.

I know that the department were probably pretty cautious about establishing this, and I am pleased that the committee process that we went through and the evidence that we received convinced all parties that advice to the minister is ultimately very useful. It convenes and facilitates engagement by the industry and it is effectively an opportunity for the government to get it right. I commend these amendments to the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I indicate the coalition's support for this package of amendments which essentially establish the Product Stewardship Advisory Group. This ties in with amendments that are to be moved by the government. We hope these amendments will together provide greater certainty for industry and for all those who are stakeholders within the operation of this act once it is passed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the concerns that Senator Ludlum outlined, that people were not sure that there was sufficient certainty about where things were going under the operation of the product stewardship scheme, the priorities for future schemes and whether they would be considered in the context of voluntary, co-regulatory or mandatory schemes, exactly how these things would work, how priorities would be set and how much forewarning there would be that an industry could be captured by such a scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the government has been at pains throughout to emphasise that processes of the regulatory impact statement and otherwise will take some time, that the prioritisation work done by the Environment Protection and Heritage Council will take some time and that there should be in the normal operation of things a good period of time for anyone to become aware that their industry is under consideration, the expec­tation is that these things will always be done in a consultative and cooperative framework. You will get the best outcomes by involving industry along the way. All of those things aside and despite the assurances given, it was still thought to be beneficial to the trans­parency of the operation of the scheme for other stakeholders to have the opportunity to have input about the priorities and, for the certainty of industry, that within the legislation there was a framework for input and prioritising and that that framework ensured that there was some public awareness of it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments moved by Senator Ludlam to establish the Product Stewardship Advisory Group provide for a structure for that input, for advice to the minister and to the council and for prioritisation. The amendments to be moved by Senator Ludlam shortly require the publishing of products that are being considered for accreditation or regulation under the act. They tie in with this and will ensure that there is public awareness and certainty for all parties. Again, I express my thanks to the other parties for the cooperative approach in addressing the concerns that the Senate committee identified and indicate the coalition's support for these amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  Before we move on, I want to put to the minister a question around an issue that I raised earlier, which is whether he considers the establishment of this advisory group as providing a mechanism for doing a couple of things: firstly, having the expert views in the room and, secondly, publishing lists of particular products or categories of waste that might soon fall under the scheme. As has been made very clear, we have three different ways of regulating different kinds of waste: voluntary schemes, where the industry goes ahead and sets up its own scheme, of which I guess the MobileMuster is an example; the co-regulatory scheme, where we see the industry working with government to establish a scheme that it can then be held to; and mandatory schemes—for example, with very hazardous materials where you do not want things left to chance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the broadest conception of this, if we get it right the first time and there is all the goodwill at the table and industry comes to the party and so on, the right products will be put in the right one of those three categories and all of a sudden, within a couple of years, we will see dramatic reductions in landfill; we will see dramatic increases in resource recovery and efficiency of recycling; we will see a huge reduction, for example, in greenhouse gas emissions from landfill as organic material is removed; and the scheme will be working as intended. My question to the minister is: at what point will assess­ments be made as to whether the targets for the various product streams—let us take the example of mobile phones—have failed to be met or are not strong enough in the first place and we still have huge volumes of material just heading out to landfill or being thrown away? What will the process be for re-evaluation of whether something should go from voluntary to co-reg or from co-reg to mandatory? What will be the levers that will drive take-up of higher recycling? What will be the penalties, for example, for missing a particular target? How does the minister envisage the advisory group driving those improvements in performance if, with a particular product or class of materials, we are still sitting here in five years time with, for example, five per cent recovery rates of mobile phones under a voluntary scheme? What will be the process of assessment whereby it is taken out of the voluntary space and, for example, we initiate a co-regulatory mechanism?</span>

I have the greatest of confidence that with the amount of effort that we have put into this legislation, and the amount of time that you and the opposition have put into it, we have developed a program which will ensure that we move forward in the direction that you certainly want us to head in. I cannot predict the future, but I do have the greatest of confidence that we will progress in the area of recycling and the areas that you are concerned about as a result of this legislation. If it turns out that it does not work in the way in which we hope or expect then obviously we will look at that and relook at it. But I think the effort that all of the parties have put into getting to this point will result in this legislation working in the way that we intend it to work. Obviously if it does not then the issue is going to have to be revisited, but I have the greatest of confidence that this legislation will do exactly what we intend it to do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  The reason that I raise this issue is that it is good that the parliamentary secretary has this high degree of confidence that the system is going to work because there is goodwill—as we have seen, there is tripartisan consensus, in this chamber at least, that this is a scheme that needs to get up and go forward—but, when you say that the bill will act as intended, there are no targets; it is an empty framework. There are no levers, for example. I would seek to have the parliamentary secretary address speci­fically the issue that I asked about: what triggers or thresholds will be set, either legislatively or as part of the work of this advisory group, that would move a product category or product scheme from one tier to the next? At what point do we say a particular voluntary scheme is not working and needs to be tightened up? There is nothing in the bill—maybe you could point it out if I have missed it—that would require that kind of transition to a higher standard of performance if we are failing in one particular area.</span>

The key inputs to the legislation, of course, are the advisory groups, the international agreements and the environment ministers council. If any one of those groups is of the view that the legislation is not working then of course it will raise that and we will deal with it on a case-by-case basis. We have the TV and computer program; that will be the first test. I am very confident that that will, particularly once we have written the regulations, demonstrate to the community that this legislation works. But there are processes by which organisations can raise any concerns about failing to meet the expectations of the legislation, and I am sure that that is what will happen.</span>

These are comple­mentary to a number of the other things that we have done and particularly to the establishment of the advisory group. These amendments will provide for the publication of those materials that are being considered for accreditation or regulation under the act and in doing so will basically give industry and groups 12 months of forewarning that an issue is on the books and under considera­tion. The likelihood is the processes will end up taking much longer than that to get from beginning to end, but at least there is in a sense a minimum time frame in here, aside from special circumstances, that ensures there is some certainty and awareness. The coalition will be supporting the amendments.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I will address some brief remarks to these amendments. I am a bit surprised that the minister did not see fit to at least briefly describe to the chamber what they actually do. There are a number here, and I am happy to address the issue of publication in advance. As Senator Birmingham has indi­cated, you would have to be not paying attention for a very long period of time to be caught out by the government's intention to regulate in one of these product stewardship schemes; these things I think are agreed well in advance. All the same, the Greens cer­tainly will not be opposing the listing in advance. That was one of the things that the committee recommended should happen to provide clarity. We would see that these amendments would work in concert with the creation of the advisory group, whereby, after the whole process has been gone through of setting priorities and hopefully establishing targets and at least implied consequences for failure to meet some of those targets, they would then make their way onto the proposed register to give everybody in the community and the industry clarity about where the process seeks to go. I do not think there is anything controversial about those amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also acknowledge that the amendments the government is seeking to batch up here and move also affect the way that this legislation will interact with state and territory laws. As I said at the outset we know that, in the policy vacuum that effectively has been the Commonwealth response to waste management in recent decades, the states and territories have gone ahead and done their own thing in many areas. So one or two of the amendments that the government is seeking to pass here ensure, for example, that state laws that might be stronger or more effective than processes established at the Commonwealth level are not expunged or wiped out by the bill. The importance of this could be seen in the example of South Australia, where we have a container deposit scheme that is very much worth preserving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian container deposit scheme has been operating since 1977 and it has been an inspiration for the rest of the country. We have seen that initiative now spread to the Northern Territory and, as I said earlier, Colleen Hartland MLC, my colleague in the Victorian parliament, is moving possibly as we speak to introduce a similar scheme in Victoria. In South Australia the service has expanded to include kerbside collection, expanded the range of containers to which deposits and refunds apply and increased the deposit to 10c. But that is a scheme that careless legislation by the Commonwealth could accidentally wipe out, if we were not careful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia now has a drink container recovery rate of over 80 per cent and there is a notable lack of litter on highways, on parks and on beaches. South Australians recycle over 1½ tonnes per person per year. The container deposit system in South Australia also benefits community organisations like scout groups that operate container collection depots. That is one of the areas where, again, we could accidentally do quite a bit of damage in here if we wipe out a scheme that has been operating successfully in South Australia. The collection depots that the Australian Greens seek in our national container deposit bill would be paid for by the operation of the scheme which would establish a network of neighbourhood recyc­ling places. While they would start out as being just for beverages they would end up being used to collect a great deal more. Scout groups in South Australia, for example, earn $9 million a year from that recycling activity, and 92 per cent of South Australians report a high level of support for their container deposit system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in the Victorian parliament, as I said, Colleen Hartland MLC is reintroducing her bill for a 10c refundable deposit on drink bottles, cans and cartons in Victoria. In 2009 her private member's bill passed in Victoria's upper house, the Legislative Council, where it gained support from all opposition parties. The then government quite famously refused to debate the bill in the lower house, where they had an absolute majority. It is worth noting that the Victorian opposition MPs who supported her 10c deposit legislation in 2009 are now in government, so it will be very interesting to see the outcome now. What this means, of course, is that because of Commonwealth inaction in this space we now have developing a patchwork of different pieces of legislation. All of them, I suspect, will work very well, but nonetheless there will be different sets of regulations applying to industries differently in the states and territories when the Commonwealth could have taken a leadership position rather than simply burying the proposal for a national scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Northern Territory, 10c deposit legislation passed unanimously. It did not end up getting party political; it ended up being the Northern Territory assembly versus the beverage industry, which was fascinating to watch. We do not seek to politicise these issues, as we have seen in the way this debate has been conducted today. What I would invite the minister to do, though, is address something that these amendments are silent on, and that is: what will happen when a Commonwealth scheme comes into effect? We know that it will not squash a state or territory scheme that is better, that it will operate at a Commonwealth level, and that is appropriate. But what will be the case where the Commonwealth brings in legislation that is better than a state or territory scheme? What will be the impacts when a product stewardship scheme introduced under this framework legislation conflicts with a state or territory scheme when the Commonwealth scheme might be an improvement? How will that actually work?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  This is a rather different debate. We have just been speaking on what passes as best practice in the Australian context on waste management. Now the debate turns again to worst practice in radioactive waste management. I will just conclude my remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are absolutely not in denial about the 4,000-odd cubic metres of so-called low level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive waste and the approximately 600 cubic metres of long-lived radioactive waste in this country. We believe that it should not have been created in the first place but we are acutely aware of the radioactive reality that has been created for current and many future generations to deal with. The Greens are also perfectly aware that 32 cubic metres of spent research reactor fuel in reprocessed form is returning to Australia from reprocessing in France and the UK in 2015-16. The Greens take this material seriously and we understand that we cannot afford to make mistakes with materials that are deadly for thousands of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the committee stage of the bill, when we come to it, we will describe at some length our alternative proposal for long-term radioactive waste management and I will sketch it now. We will seek to establish a process for identifying suitable sites that are scientific, transparent, accountable and fair and allow access to appeal mechanisms. I will put this on the record one last time in this second reading debate: we are very willing to work with the Gillard government and the opposition on this issue construc­tively and carefully. If the government chooses to return to the path that it was planning and advocating prior to the 2007 election which saw the Rudd government come to power, and if the government abandons its strategy of aggression and dispossession, we will support it in putting something better in place. But, if not, the government needs to know that it has picked a fight with powerful and resilient people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spent a great deal of time on the road in the last couple of years working on this issue. I know for an absolute fact that many of the people that the government has chosen to target have nowhere else to go. They strongly and genuinely believe that if their land is taken away that they will simply have nothing. It is not good enough for the government to draw rectangles on the map, try and split families and communities off from each other and imagine that there will not be significant strong, sustained and ultimately successful resistance. The govern­ment has failed in the past in attempts to coercively dump radioactive waste on communities that are simply not willing to host it and do not understand why, if it is not safe in southern Sydney, suddenly it should be made safe by parking it in a shed or a shallow hole in the ground on their country. People do not understand that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Dianne Stokes and Mark Lane, who have spent time in this building far from home advocating, and Kylie Sambo, who was here with Dianne yesterday, making the case very strongly and proudly speaking out for their country and culture that they do not believe that they owe the rest of Australia an obligation to host this toxic material until the end of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are people who have been following this campaign closely, supporting the various people who found themselves on the front line, including Nat Wasley who has given up an enormous amount of her own time and dedicated herself to this campaign in the most extraordinary way, along with Paddy Gibson and little Jellybean who was in the public gallery, I think, probably for the first time yesterday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Alice Springs, Hilary Tyler has marshalled the views of the Public Health Association and medical opinion to stop the government from hiding behind this argu­ment that somehow cancer treatments require that we produce these toxic cate­gories of waste. Dave Sweeney from the Australian Conser­vation Foundation has been absol­utely extraordinary on this issue and has provided leadership over a sustained period of time as the Australian government has lurched from one emergency and coercive strategy to another, and all the folks at ACE and Friends of the Earth have made it their jobs to remind the minister that he may be a very long way from his office in Batman to the site of the dump but in fact he will be reminded day in, day out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, Felicity Hill in my office has been a profoundly supportive and important part of this campaign and came on the road on many occasions to committee visits and demonstrations in remote parts of the country to pursue this cause. I also at this point urge support for my second reading amendment already moved.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JX4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MINCHIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>): I rise to speak on this bill in my capacity as the minister responsible for radioactive waste from 1998 to 2001 and as the minister responsible for the Land Acquisition Act, and hence the acquisition of a radioactive site, from 2001 to 2007. So I do have a long and intimate association with this vexed issue. I regret to say that the way this issue has been handled over the last 20 years is an indictment of Australia's political culture and, with great respect to my friends and colleagues opposite, the Australian Labor Party in particular. It is now nearly 20 years since the then responsible minister, Simon Crean, announced the then federal Labor government's commitment to a national repository and commenced the formal research for the best sites for that repository—and that process was still underway when we came to government in 1996.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At that point, regrettably, the ALP, then in opposition, took a 180-degree turn on this issue. From that point on, while the coalition continued the process initiated by Simon Crean and the Labor Party, the Labor Party, at state and federal levels, opposed us every step of the way. Labor spent 11½ years doing everything it possibly could to frustrate and oppose the implementation of the policy it devised when in government. The exploitation of community concern about radioactive material during that 11½ years was a real low point in Australian politics. When the then opposition could have, and should have, acted in the national interest to join with the coalition government to implement its own policy, it chose opportunism, cynicism and fearmongering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To some extent, the worst offenders were not the federal opposition but the Rann Labor government in South Australia. Two years prior to the Rann government's election in 2002, the independent process over which I in government presided, but which had been implemented by Simon Crean, con­cluded that the central north region of South Australia was the best place in Australia to build a national radioactive waste repository. So it fell to me as the then Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, and in the interesting position of being a senator for South Australia, to announce the outcome of that scientific research in 2000 and the identification of a prospective sites in the central north of my home state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To its great credit, the then state Liberal government in South Australia looked to the national interest and did not oppose that outcome. The Rann state Labor opposition, of course, saw a political opportunity and immediately started campaigning against having a national repository in South Australia. It did not seem to matter to Rann Labor that a national repository was federal Labor government policy under Hawke and Keating, that the federal Labor government had initiated the nationwide scientific search and that the search had identified the central north of South Australia as the best site. It did not seem to matter to the Rann Labor Party that building this national repository would enable the removal of radioactive waste from the centre of the city of Adelaide, where it was then, and still is, stored in basements on our main boulevard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After their victory in the 2002 election the Rann Labor government used every resource available to a state government to frustrate the federal process, aided and abetted, I regret to say, by the then federal Labor opposition. The South Australian state Labor government used legislation and the courts and the cynical manipulation of South Australian public opinion to make it practically impossible for a federal coalition government to put a repository where the science—which we now hear we must obey—had told us was the best place in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as a South Australian senator and as the responsible minister, I bore the brunt of those rather vicious Labor attacks. I was branded a traitor to my state, I was pilloried at every opportunity and even my children suffered abuse at their local South Australian school. I needed police protection at public functions when I argued the case for this repository. So it was without question the ugliest period of my political career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this cynical campaign was perpetrated by a state party and leader who had done everything they could at that stage to stop the development in South Australia of the Olympic Dam uranium mine—but they are now, of course, its biggest champions. Rann Labor now says: 'We do want the world's biggest uranium mine in South Australia but under no circumstances could we have a national repository for Australia's short-lived and intermediate level radioactive waste. The Howard government did the only thing it could: leave Mr Rann to wallow in his rank hypocrisy and seek to establish a Commonwealth repository in the Northern Territory. We were left with no other option, given the actions of the Rann Labor government. So those opposed to a repository in the Northern Territory have Mr Rann to blame. But for him, we would already have a national repository up and running in outback South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, of course, we are regrettably witnessing the hypocrisy of federal Labor. Federal Labor in opposition aided and abetted the Rann Labor government in its campaign to frustrate the national interest. Federal Labor attacked us relentlessly on this issue. Federal Labor in opposition voted against our 2005 legislation to develop a Commonwealth repository in the Northern Territory and promised at the 2007 election to repeal our legislation. Of course, now that they are back in government they are being mugged by the same reality that the previous Labor government faced nearly 20 years ago and they are now committed to establishing what Australia must have: a national purpose-built repository. So now we have a Labor bill which is essentially the same as our 2005 legislation which, as I say, Labor so cynically opposed at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the then shadow minister for resources and energy in the coalition, in March last year, just before my resignation, I sought and obtained shadow cabinet and coalition party room support for this Labor legislation, and I was gratified that the coalition party room put the national interest first rather than pursuing a cynical, short-sighted and politi­cally motivated opposition. Unlike Labor in opposition, we will not play politics on this issue, and I applaud my own party for the stand they are taking. We must build this repository. As I said at the outset, it is a sad indictment of the political culture of this country that, for nearly 20 years, successive federal governments of both persuasions have tried to do the right thing without success. As a nation we have been incapable of collectively accepting the need for a purpose-built repository for our radioactive waste—nobody else's—and to get it built and get it operational.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The political exploitation of the tendency to nimbyism will cripple this country unless we unite to overcome it. Labor and the coalition must understand the importance of putting politics aside and joining together in the national interest to achieve outcomes like the proper safe disposal of radioactive waste. My experience with this radioactive waste issue, over many years, is why I have repeatedly and consistently said to my own party that without bipartisanship you can completely forget about nuclear power in Australia. If, after 20 years, we still have not been able to establish a low-level radioactive waste repository out in the desert, imagine how long it is going to take to build a nuclear power station. So I welcome the somewhat belated bipartisanship on this waste issue. We have to get this repository built as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the government for bringing in this legislation and I commend my colleagues for agreeing to support it. I conclude by commending my colleague Senator Nigel Scullion for his handling of this issue. As it was difficult for South Australian senators, so it is difficult for Northern Territory senators—both Labor and coalition. I do know how tough it has been for both of them. I want to commend to the Senate the amendment moved by Senator Scullion and I urge the government to accept his very sensible proposal.</span>

                    <a href="QD4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOB BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I join my colleague Senator Ludlam in opposing this legislation. I take up the point at the end of Senator Minchin's very sharp and well-delivered speech where he said, in advocating that this bill pass expeditiously: imagine how long it is going to take to build a nuclear power station after the length of time it has taken to establish a nuclear waste dump. Therein lies an enunciation of the fear that so many people have about a nuclear waste dump being put 'in the desert', as Senator Minchin puts it—that is, in this ecosystem in the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not as innocent as it looks. This is a proposal to put low-level waste from medical facilities or whatever into a place that is out of the range of most city dwellers but on the land of Indigenous people in Central Australia, against the wishes of people in the region that is being targeted by this legislation. But what Senator Minchin has clearly outlined is a proposal that in future this waste dump also be the repository for waste coming from the proliferation of nuclear power stations in Australia. We do not need long memories to go back to the Howard proposal, in the run-up to the 2007 election, that there be up to 25 nuclear power stations around Australia, close to—for grid reasons and because they are cooled by water—existing major population centres. It is very much alive and on the agenda of the alternative government of this country that nuclear power stations will come down the line, despite what we have seen unfold in Japan in recent months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is as if on the benches opposite there is an inability to grasp the threat to humanity of the whole nuclear power cycle. I want to talk about that for a moment, because a former Prime Minister approached me recently proposing that Australia become a nuclear waste dump for the whole world and the money coming from such a nuclear waste dump be put to environmental purposes. I said: 'Well, Bob, how can that be? The environmental threat of a nuclear waste dump feeding a nuclear industry on the planet far outrides any monetary advantage that might be put into the environment itself.' Let us make no mistake: Muckaty Station is targeted not just for a low-level or even medium-level nuclear waste dump, as proposed in this legislation, but to become the Australian repository of waste from a nuclear industry which has huge plans afoot for nuclear power stations in this country. At the highest levels of corporate thinking is the proposal that this waste dump become a global nuclear waste dump. And (a) leads to (b) leads to (c). You cannot see this legislation divorced from that intent. Senator Minchin has just given a clear indicator of how live and prospective these proposals are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ludlam has done an enormous amount of work in evaluating this proposal and has outlined more specific and local reasons for not going ahead with it. Senator Minchin has condemned the South Australian government for opposing north-east South Australia as a site for a nuclear waste dump, and I add this: every reason that the Rann government gave for opposing a nuclear waste dump in north-east South Australia applies to this proposal in the Northern Territory. It is simply a case of the Commonwealth having the power over the Territory that it does not have in overriding a state interest. What is good enough for South Australia is good enough for the Northern Territory.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  Following eighteen months in the planning, on Friday, 13 May a delegation from members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's Defence Subcommittee left Australia for the purpose of visiting Australian Defence Force personnel in areas of Afghanistan. I as chair, deputy chair Dr Dennis Jensen, the member for Tangney, Ms Gai Brodtmann, the member for Canberra, and Mr Stuart Robert, the member for Fadden, along with defence advisor Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Kenny, made up the delegation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset I held no preconceived views of the country, the security situation or our ADF personnel serving in the country. Notwithstanding that, based as it was on my previous involvement with the Defence Subcommittee and the parliamentary defence programs I have been involved in, my long­standing opinion of the professionalism and competence of our ADF personnel was only further enhanced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Saturday took us into Dubai and directly onto the Joint Task Force 633 Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. The base is strategic to the supply and staging of operations into and out of Afghanistan for our ADF personnel. The role and importance of HQ JTF 633, which provides the national command of Australian forces deployed across the Middle East area of operations, is quickly understood once you receive the briefings which are supplied.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the day briefs, opportunities to meet our ADF personnel and basic training were provided to the delegation. This included training in improvised explosive device detection and an explana­tion both of the composition of the devices and of the improvised techniques used by the insurgents in making these insidious devices, which have taken the lives of so many of our young ADF personnel. These devices are made with the most basic of materials, and this left me astonished at how they could ever detonate. Despite that fact, these explosives have taken so many lives, such as that of our last brave digger, Sergeant Brett Wood, who was tragically killed seven days after we had been in Kandahar during a partnered, dismounted patrol by Provincial Response Company Uruzgan and Special Operations Task Group. During our briefing we were informed that one particular digger had stood on IEDs on two occasions without having them detonate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, we were given the oppor­tunity to be provided with trauma first aid treatment using the latest techniques available to our troops in the battlefield. This included use of bandaging for critical upper body circumstances. All of us were provided with opportunities to fire the standard Steyr rifle on the base firing range, and before heading back to the main base for dinner we were measured up for our protective vests and helmets and introduced to commandos serving with the 2nd Commando Regiment personal security detail, who provided complete security for us while we were in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The three- to three-and-a-half hour trip to Tarin Kowt, Oruzgan province, in the south of Afghanistan in the C130 Hercules provided a good opportunity both to see from the cockpit of the aircraft the environment we were entering and to talk to troops being dispatched to the province. The flight into Tarin Kowt provided the opportunity to see what have been determined to be 'green zones', in which the population irrigate their produce with the melting winter snows from the mountains and which provide a stark contrast with the surrounding desert land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Landing on the recently provided sealed airstrip, which was built as a result of a commitment by the ISAF, the initial impression was that we could have been arriving at an airstrip anywhere in the world. The only indications of the reality that we were in a war zone were the many uniformed ADF personnel, being escorted from the flight while dressed in our vests and helmets and, of course, the many defence craft on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The visit to Tarin Kowt provided a unique opportunity to observe the success of our involvement in Afghanistan. In addition to the briefings provided throughout our short stay, the most telling examples of our success in the country were provided when we visited a patrol base in Mirabad valley, which is outside the wire. The flight there and back in two Black Hawk helicopters provided opportunities to see at first hand infrastructure building in the region, such as a new sealed road—which is opening up the region to areas in north-western Afghan­istan—and the new mosque, both of which were built as a result of our commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having arrived at the patrol base we witnessed mortar training and engagement on the ground, which involved both ADF personnel and the Afghan National Army. Having met the senior officers and a number of our troops, we were then summoned to a meeting with several local Afghan elders. In spite of the fact that the two parties required interpreters in order to communicate, the clear message from the elders was of the need for infrastructure rather than anything about safety. Additionally, the elders pro­vided overwhelming endorsement of our ADF officers and personnel, complimenting them on the excellent work that they had been achieving in the valley. No doubt feedback like this clearly demonstrates that our involvement in Afghanistan is winning the hearts and minds of these people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">HQ Combined Team Uruzgan, CT-U, has been achieving in the following areas. It has responsibility for mentoring and developing the Afghan 4th Brigade of 205th Corps. It has made significant progress in security since taking over from the Dutch. It has expanded security coverage from 18 patrol bases to 36 patrol bases. It has a strong relationship with a very effective provincial governor and provincial chief of police, which has lead to improved governance and development and thus improved security. It has had a very effective winter campaign—a mild winter has allowed successful operations during which CT-U has increased the area under ISAF and Afghan control and security. SOTG has been key to the winter gains, as they have taken 19 mid- and low-level Taliban leaders off the field. CT-U's focus for the 2011 fighting season is to hold onto what has been gained over winter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Oruzgan is a difficult area for develop­ment projects due to its remoteness and the harshness of its terrain. It is the poorest province in Afghanistan, and its demo­graphics are really challenging. Across the province the literacy rate is 10 per cent overall and 0.2 per cent for women. School attendance is 20 per cent, whereas nationally it is 50 per cent. Thirty-seven per cent of children do not reach the age of five years, and typically 50 per cent of each village is under 18 years of age. During our stay in Kandahar we were able to visit the Rotary Wing Group, which provided for the operation of two CH-47D Chinook heli­copters supporting ISAF operations. Additionally, we were afforded briefings of the Heron detachment, which provides surveillance and intelligence in the country and the Kandahar Role 3 Hospital. Lieutenant Marcus Case, Australian Army Aviation Corps, who was killed on 30 May while serving on operations in Afghanistan, was from the Sydney based 6th Aviation Regiment and had been deployed to Afghanistan as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. The Chinook he was in was effectively destroyed in the crash; however, the five survivors, I understand, are being rehabilitated and are in a satisfactory condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to Kabul: alongside the opportunities to meet some members of parliament from the government and the Australian Ambassador to Afghanistan, Paul Foley, seeing further work by the joint forces in training the Afghan National Army was a worthy experience. Parliamentarians we were fortunate to meet included Khalid Pashtoon, the Deputy Speaker of the Afghan parliament; Fawzia Koofi, chairwoman of the defence and territorial affairs standing committee; and Hasham Watanwal, representing Oruzgan province and deputy chair of the defence and territorial affairs standing committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later the next day, before we left Kabul, we went up to another base to visit the Artillery Training Team Kabul, or ATT-K. The ATT-K was established by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Vagg in 2010 from scratch, and is now considered a model ANA school. The ATT-K is an Australian artillery-led coalition team, with nine nations providing personnel and equipment. The Australian Army provides 20 personnel to the team. The ATT-K mission is to facilitate the training, advice and mentoring of ANA field artillery soldiers and officers so that they become capable of sustaining a professional ANA field artillery independent of coalition support.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Key to training ANA members to become artillery soldiers and officers has been literacy. ATT-K has embedded literacy training throughout all of its courses, and that model is now being exported by NATO Training Mission Afghanistan to all other ANA schools. Soldiers arrive at basic artillery training without being able to read or write; by the end of their basic course they can do so to a grade 1 level, and each subsequent course will increase their level of literacy. I think the best example we saw whilst at the ATT-K base was an elderly Afghan solider—I would put him at around 53 or 54—who was reading, for the first time, to the rest of the class his writings from the whiteboard. Six weeks earlier he could not read or write at all. So once again, that just demonstrates our commitment and success in this country and this conflict.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Has there been progress in Afghanistan's development over the past nine years? Put simply, yes. There has been a dramatic increase in school enrolments, from around one million in 2001, none of whom were girls, to over six million today, one-third, or two million, of whom are girls. There has also been a significant increase in the availability of basic health services, which were available to less than 10 per cent of the population under the former Taliban regime but are now extended to around 85 per cent of the people. Further, there has been the identification and management of over 39,000 community based infrastructure projects, such as wells, clinics and roads, in over 22,000 communities across Afghan­istan, through the Afghan led National Solidarity Program. Almost 10,000 km of rural roads have been rehabilitated, sup­porting the employment of hundreds of thousands of local workers, through the National Rural Access Program. The telecommunications industry has created about 100,000 jobs since 2001, and 10 million Afghans today have access to telecommunications, compared to only 20,000 in 2001.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ISAF has effectively, over the past Afghan winter, denied the Taliban its spiritual heartland in the south of the country. Notwithstanding that, General Krause has described the situation in Kandahar as not all milk and honey. But we have secured the area. He attributed this outcome to the mild winter, the poppy harvest being slightly later and Ramadan being earlier this year. The Afghan National Army stands at 159,400, with a projected growth to 171,600 by November 2011. Equally, the Afghan National Police has a strength of 125,000, with a target of 134,000 by November 2011. Literacy is a major obstacle, with 86 per cent of new ANA recruits totally illiterate and innumerate. At 31 March 2011, there were 70,000 ANSF<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>personnel in literacy training, while 72,000 had already completed some degree of training. In the words of General Krause, 'Transition is no longer a dream; it is actually going to happen for the first provinces.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The journey to Afghanistan has had a profound effect on me personally, deepening my strong empathy for our Australia Defence Force men and women. Compounding this experience was learning of the news, seven days following our visit to Kandahar, during a Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee estimates hearing, of the death of Sergeant Brett Wood, and then learning of the additional tragic deaths, of Lieutenant Marcus Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones a week following, and then, most recently, of Sapper Rowan Robinson.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To digress slightly, on the subject of our troops and what they are doing over there in the Middle East: it was only two Sundays ago, during a Building the Education Revolution event, not far from my home, that I had the opportunity to speak to one of our ADF personnel from Enoggera base. I think that, by that stage in that particular day, there were some results coming in from some survey where people were saying we should withdraw our troops. But he made the point to me—and it is a compelling argument—that we need to support our troops. We need to give them the confidence in the work they are trained to do in this country and the good work they are performing. I think that is a point that needs to be reflected on every time that argument comes up about withdrawing our troops. We also need to remind ourselves that the Taliban monitors the news that is being delivered around the globe about these matters. We do not need to give them ammunition to detract from and reduce confidence in the good work our troops are doing. In closing, may I sincerely pass on my deepest respect for those heroes who gave their lives. I give my condolences to their families and mates and to those injured in those terrible events, who were serving our country with such dignity and patriotism.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="xt4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RONALDSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  At the heart of this Gillard Labor government lies the truth that it is an illegitimate government. The government is not only illegitimate but also hopelessly divided. Only today we read how Labor backbenchers are at war with each other about policy decisions taken by their own party. It is a tale of zombies and daleks. The members—described by one of their own as 'zombies'—are generally too frightened to speak out. The factional warlords—the 'daleks', according to one past leader—are angry at their loss of power and influence. Today's media reports describe a vicious exchange in yesterday's caucus meeting between a backbencher from the New South Wales Central Coast, the member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, and his New South Wales Labor colleague Senator Doug Cameron.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul Keating famously declared that where New South Wales Labor goes, so too goes the nation. This is indeed a troubling omen for our nation. Today I wish to discuss renewed allegations against the said Mr Thomson—all of which are on the public record. Mr Thomson's actions go to the heart of this government's legitimacy. Mr Thomson is now into his second term as a member of the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, serious concerns remain about Mr Thomson's past as a union heavy in the Health Services Union. There are serious allegations including allegations of fraud and electoral misconduct. It is time to end Labor's deafening silence concerning these very serious allegations. Put simply, it is time for the Prime Minister to show leadership. Mr Thomson is not fit to be a member of parliament and he should be stood down immediately. Of course, the Prime Minister knows this. In normal circumstances the member for Dobell would not be allowed to continue. But, in the so-called 'new paradigm' where the government has only a wafer-thin majority, the Prime Minister lacks the courage and the leadership authority to deal with the member for Dobell appropriately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before he entered parliament, the member for Dobell was National Secretary of the Health Services Union. His union provided him with a credit card which was to be used for union related expenditure. The member for Dobell was entrusted by the union to spend its funds appropriately—something he ultimately would not do. It is alleged that over a five-year period the member for Dobell withdrew $101,533 in cash advances from his union credit card. Further, it is alleged he used his union credit card to fund his election campaign for Dobell. Without any authorisation to do so, Mr Thomson allegedly spent over $104,000 of the HSU's money on his own election campaign. This alleged breach of trust by the member for Dobell resulted in both the HSU and Mr Thomson filing false election expenditure disclosure reports with the Australian Electoral Commission. So cavalier was the member for Dobell with his union credit card that it is alleged by Fairfax media that on at least four occasions he used the card to pay for prostitutes. Fairfax detailed those allegations, and I will not repeat them here today. Is this what the hardworking members of the HSU expect their union dues to be spent on? Is it right that the money that mums and dads gave to their union to represent them in the workplace is siphoned off for such activities? The answer is, of course, an emphatic no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will turn now to the HSU investigation. Ms Kathy Jackson took over as National Secretary of the Health Services Union when Mr Thomson entered parliament in 2007. She was reportedly appalled by the rorting that went on during Mr Thomson's tenure. Ms Jackson advised the union's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, to engage BDO Australia to conduct a forensic audit of the HSU national office. The member for Dobell was owed $191,913 in employee entitlements when he resigned from the HSU. However, due to the cloud that hung over his head concerning misuse of union funds, the HSU instructed its lawyers to write to Mr Thomson informing him that he would not receive his entitlements. Ms Jackson, courageously, reported the member for Dobell to Fair Work Australia for further investigation. Fair Work Australia's investigation into the member for Dobell is ongoing. Amongst other things, the investigation will determine whether his credit card expenditure breached any fiduciary duties which he owed to the union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the back of media allegations against him, Mr Thomson's inappropriate dealings have been raised on a number of occasions in Senate estimates with both the Australian Electoral Commission and Fair Work Australia. It has now become apparent that, despite his serious breach under the Electoral Act, Mr Thomson will avoid being charged with the serious indictable offence of providing a false declaration to the Com­mon­wealth. We have also learned that 12 people have been interviewed during the Fair Work Australia investigation and that several demands have been made for documents to be handed over. While Mr Terry Nassios of Fair Work Australia still has conduct of the day-to-day affairs of the investigation, and he believes that it would not compromise the investigation for it to be made public exactly who was interviewed, he has been overruled by the Gillard government at Senate estimates. The reason for being overruled remains unclear. Or is it? We are not allowed to know the names of the people interviewed or what they said. The investigation, we are told, will be completed in the latter half of this year. Following the investigation, Fair Work Australia will seek advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether to prosecute Mr Thomson. The matters I have raised today are not new. They were revealed exclusively by Mark Davis of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> on 9 April 2009. At the time, the member for Dobell denied the allegations. He began defamation pro­ceedings against Fairfax. He complained to Simon Benson of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span>, 'Unfortunately as a politician you have to go through a legal process to prove your innocence.' Mr Thomson's defence was that he was interstate at the time of some of the escort agency transactions. However, in interlocutory proceedings it was revealed that phone calls were made from Mr Thomson's own telephone to one of those agencies. It was also revealed that his drivers licence number matched the licence number taken down on the credit card slip when he paid for one of the escort agency services. At one point during the interlocutory proceedings, Mr Thomson was ordered to pay Fairfax's costs. On Monday, 6 June 2011, we found out that just days before a three-week jury trial was scheduled to begin Mr Thomson filed a notice of discontinuance with the Supreme Court of New South Wales. What does this mean? It means that, despite every opportunity to prove that he did not rip off his union and spend their money inappropriately on himself and his election campaign, Mr Thomson surren­dered. It shows that, despite the opportunity to prove in court, before a jury of his peers, that the serious allegations against him were false, Mr Thomson folded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 6 June this year, in a <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> article headed, 'Labor MP drops case against Fairfax', Geesche Jacobsen wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Fairfax Media, publisher of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span>, was defending the case on the basis the allegations were true. It alleged that Mr Thomson was unfit to be a federal MP. Fairfax stands by the allegations published in the articles, which appeared from April 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By filing a notice of discontinuance in his defamation proceedings against Fairfax, Mr Thomson has ensured that the allegations have now become the truth. It was reported in vex.news.com on 8 June that Mr Thomson is now alleging that Fairfax breached the terms of a confidential settlement and that he has again referred the matter to his lawyers. It is another action designed to stall the inevitable. It is another action that we know will not be followed up with completed legal proceedings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this issue no longer rides on the back of the Fair Work Australia investigation or Mr Thomson's defamation proceedings, which is the subtle message being pushed by the ALP. The Prime Minister knows the truth. If she does not, then she should read the newspapers and <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> more carefully. She must act now. These very serious allegations require her full attention. Her crumbling credibility and the diminishing authority of her government rest on her satisfactory handling of this matter. It is time for the Prime Minister to say whether or not she supports Fairfax media's statement. If she believes Mr Thomson is fit to be a member of parliament, the Prime Minister must make a clear statement explaining why. In doing so, she must publicly refute the allegations of fraud, inappropriate use of union funds for pros­titutes and syphoning of funds to support an election campaign; if not, she must immed­iately sack Mr Thomson. Mr Thomson refused to defend his credibility at trial and, as a result, the Prime Minister's credibility is now on trial. </span>

                  <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  I rise to express my concern, the concern of my colleagues and the concern of people all over the world for the people of Japan, including our friends and colleagues whose lives changed on 11 March this year, when the triple disaster of an earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear plant accident occurred. I am continually moved by the strength, ingenuity and improvisation of the Japanese people and by their remarkable capacity for efficient and large-scale organisation. They have endured through the crisis and trauma stages and are now continuing into the long-term recovery and clean-up phases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to honour those people who continue to open their homes, care for the displaced and support the grieving and traumatised. It is also life-saving work. It is less glamorous and it occurs in slow motion behind the scenes, but it is no less important for that. I continue to believe, as I said three months ago when the crisis first hit, that our efforts and concern should be focused on supporting the Japanese people through their time of crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I also observe that the nuclear industry is using this national and global catastrophe to wage a pronuclear crusade. Some in the industry have trivialised the incident as a sideshow or a distraction, which is an extraordinary way of referring to three or four full-size nuclear power stations in full-scale meltdown. I said at the time of the disaster that there must at some stage come a reckoning. That time is now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia we have witnessed some of the more vulgar examples of the uranium export industry almost using the suffering and real and long-term damage at Fukushima as a free promotional ad rather than warning against the world's most expensive and dangerous method for boiling water. That is why I want to put some facts on the table today about the significance and the severity of the disaster that is still unfolding. There are those who still have not learned the lessons of 60 years of this industry's sordid history and those who continue to profit from the export of uranium from Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fukushima now is a word that has entered our lexicon in the same way that Chernobyl and Three Mile Island did. It is no longer just the name of a place. It is the name of an event, an event that continues to worsen. Within only a few days of the 25th anniversary of the disaster at Chernobyl, the disaster at Fukushima was upgraded to level 7 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale—that is, it is the worst possible type of nuclear event, where it is acknowledged by industry and government that the impacts are far-reaching and extend well beyond the immediate vicinity of the plant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ARPANSA, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, states that the upgrade to level 7 is based on an assessment of the cumulative radiation releases since the accident began. The radiation has, according to the Compre­hensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisa­tion, the CTBTO, reached Australian shores. The Darwin CTBTO radionuclide-mon­itoring station has detected trace amounts of xenon 133 at the air samples collected in April. The radioactive cloud reached Europe in late March. French institutions detected traces of iodine 131 in milk that were eight to 10 times higher than background. So Fukushima is now the name of a place and the name of an event, and that event is not only happening in Japan but also in Europe, North America and here in Australia. At the epicentre, Australians, Americans and French were warned by their governments to keep at least 80 kilometres away. On 7 June in a report from Japan to the United Nations the Japanese government included in its 750 pages a confession that fuel in three of the reactors at Fukushima had melted right through the containment structure. The day before this report was tabled Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency doubled the figure for the radiation it believed was released into the atmosphere in the first six days from 370,000 terabecquerels to 770,000. On 3 June we learned that the authorities had suppressed the finding of radioactive tellurium six kilometres from Fukushima. The presence of this isotope indicates that the temperature of the fuel rods was over 1,000 degrees and this was known on 12 March—the day after the tsunami hit the plant. It was known that there had been a loss of coolant accident and that a meltdown had commenced before the emergency ventilation of the unit 1 reactor containment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very interested to know whether our government knew this. Was this information transmitted from the government of Japan or not? Did the interdepartmental group know? Did ARPANSA know? Did the CTBTO monitoring system tell us that the meltdown had already occurred within 24 hours of the reactor complex being hit by the tsunami? What else did we know besides the fact that we were lied to and that the Japanese people were lied to? We know that the Japanese National Police Agency has been tasked with issuing internet service providers with requests to delete information deemed to be harmful rumours confirming Fukushima including, perhaps, harmful rumours like the truth about radioactive toxins leaking for three months and for many more months into the future, into the air, into the water and onto the Japanese fields—radiation that has now turned up in Tokyo's sewerage system, radiation that during the early days made people in Tokyo afraid of the water coming out of their taps. For a time they were told not to feed tap water to infants or to pregnant women on account of iodide concentrations in the tap water in Tokyo. That is 260 kilometres from the site of the triple meltdown. The suppression and concealment of information only increases fear, suspicion and a lack of faith that people might hold in their institutions. That information is vital for people to protect themselves. Australian authorities told Australian nationals not to stay within 80 kilometres of the plant, but we know that the exclusion zone is still only 30.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greenpeace has found unsafe radiation levels in marine species 50 kilometres from the site of the meltdown. The US Department of Energy aircraft surveys have shown a belt of contamination with three million to 14.5 million becquerels of caesium-137 per square metre to the north-west of the plant. So there is now a plume of caesium reaching 60 kilometres to the north-west towards Fukushima City. To put those figures in perspective, those living in areas around Chernobyl with more than 555,000 becquerels of caesium-137 were forced to relocate. As the disaster continues and the radiation spreads so too does a new level of awareness that nuclear energy is too expensive, the risks are too high, the government subsidies are too large and this is simply no solution at all to climate change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, the German government has decided to phase out nuclear power by 2022. The Swiss government will phase out nuclear power permanently by 2034. Japan has abandoned plans for nuclear energy to provide half of its capacity and has scrapped 14 planned new reactors  The Chinese State Council has put an embargo on approval of new reactors. There is quite simply no nuclear renaissance. The nuclear industry was in enormous trouble well before the disaster at the Fukushima complex reminded the world and awoke the ghosts of Chernobyl who perhaps had been forgotten by a whole new generation of people who were told that nuclear power is safe and that that was a one-off.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This exercise will also need a serious global debate on broader issues, including assessment of the costs, risks and benefits of nuclear energy and stronger connections between nuclear safety, nuclear security and nuclear non-proliferation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, including at the NPT Review Conference that took place in New York last year, the nuclear industry has been all over these disarmament and non-proliferation conferences like flies seeking to protect their commercial interests in the expansion and proliferation of nuclear technology even as the world grapples with the problem of reducing the proliferation of this exact same technology into more and more hands while working out what on earth to do with the nuclear armed states who adopted this Cold War suicide pact that was never stood down.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the United State's 104 nuclear reactors, 66 have already had their licenses extended 20 years, while another 18 are under Nuclear Regulatory Commission review. This is extraordinarily dangerous. People on the side of nuclear advocacy and the expansion of uranium mines from the troubled radioactive hotspots in the Northern Territory and South Australia need to be aware that, if the industry believes that Fukushima was the last time that this will ever happen, they must be living in some kind of state of delusion. They have been having one-in-a million-year accidents and disasters about once every 30 years and that is simply unacceptable. The idea of course is that the industry now faces this extreme crunch as the cohort of reactors that were built during the binge in the 1960s and 1970s are ageing and these plants must be retired. At the other end of the spectrum the Chinese government has embarked on an aggressive build of new and untested nuclear plants with help from the global nuclear industry. With sales flatlined at home the global nuclear power sector has been very aggressive at pushing their technology not just into China but deeply into our region as well, which is why nuclear advocates are happy to publish maps of a new fleet of plants in Indonesia, for example—a seismically active zone where you would have to imagine that putting nuclear power plants would be utterly reckless.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the disaster in Fukushima, the world's nuclear industry was in decline. As at 1 April 2011 there were 437 nuclear plants operating in the world, seven fewer than in 2002. In 2008 for the first time since the beginning of the nuclear age no new unit was started up. Seven new plants were added in 2009 and 2010 while 11 were shut down over that period. This trend is set to accelerate as the huge number of reactors that were built in the 1960s and 1970s will be forced to close by citizen advocacy, by expert opinion and by engineering testing. When these reactors are stress tested people will realise that some of them are quite simply too dangerous to run any longer. They certainly should not be relicensed to extend their lives from 40 to 60 years such that you would have plants operating that would have been running since before any of the current generation of operators were even born. I say to investors in the nuclear industry and particularly to their strongest advocate in this building, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson: take a very close look at the performance of the industry globally because Australian uranium exporters and investors are uniquely vulnerable to this volatile and unpredictable industry that has never lived up to the promises it has made in the past. We have been given a sharp reminder of the consequences of those exports from the three troubled facilities that we have in Australia for exporting this toxic material to other parts of the world with Australian uranium now burning the air over the Tohoku region on Japan's Pacific coast. I say to these investors: take a really good look at the performance of this industry—not its promises but its performances—and at what it has actually managed to achieve in the 60 years of colossal government largess, loan guarantees, direct subsidies, immunity from insurance liability and the enormous amount of money that has been shovelled into research and development so that the industry can continually say, 'No, you have got us wrong; we are just about to invent the safe lead of nuclear reactors or imaginary commercial thorium reactors or fourth-generation reactors or invoking a plutonium fuel cycle', which does not exist and must not ever be brought into being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry not only poses a real and present threat to the surrounding host communities, who are exposed to the trace radiation, the low level radiation, from radon gas emissions from the mines and so on, but indeed poses a threat to investors themselves, the people who believe this industry has a bright future. It absolutely does not. The future of the nuclear industry is in long-term intergenerational waste management and stewardship of the extraordinary categories of toxic and poisonous waste it produces and in looking after the people it has already damaged in three generations of the reckless pursuit of electricity too cheap to meter that must finally be set aside as the pipedream that it always was.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I rise on a matter of public interest and that is the destruction of workers rights in New South Wales by the Liberal-National coalition state government. The O'Farrell government has followed the Howard government Work Choices play book, the play book invented by Peter Reith, Senator Abetz, Senator Minchin and defended staunchly at every chance by Senator Bushby. Senator Bushby is always defending Work Choices but never defending Tasmania. There was no warning, no debate and no policy proposal to strip away the rights of 400,000 New South Wales workers. This is an ideological attack on firefighters, nurses, bus drivers, train drivers, public servants—ordinary Australians who have dedicated their lives to serving the New South Wales community, ordinary Australians who simply want a fair go and the capacity to maintain and improve their standard of living. These workers are public servants; they are not public enemies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing the New South Wales Police Force from the coverage of this legislation is an admission that the legislation is unfair, inequitable and unsustainable. New South Wales public servants have had access to an independent umpire since 1901. The Indust­rial Relations Amendment (Public Sector Conditions of Employment) Bill is designed to impose government wages policy on government employees. Premier O'Farrell has introduced a new concept in wages policy when he argues there is no point in having government wages policy if it can be ignored. If this is the coalition approach, then logically they would be seeking to have it extended to all workers so the boss can determine the wages policy and his or her policy cannot be ignored. This is a major challenge to fairness and equity in the Australian workplace and a major challenge to the Australian ethos of a fair go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stagnating wages in the New South Wales public sector will mean that public sector workers will face real hardship. Where are the voices of indignation and concern for Australian workers that we hear so hypocritically espoused by the New South Wales coalition senators and MPs? Where are Senator Fierravanti-Wells and the Liberal member for the Blue Mountains, Roza Sage, who expressed their concern about the living standards of public servants? We have not heard a word from them. Has the member for Macquarie, Louise Markus, raised the issue of public servants' living standards with her mates in Macquarie Street? I will bet she has not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would Senator Fierravanti-Wells or Mrs Markus express concern? It is because they feign concern for workers' living standards at the same time as they yearn for a return to Work Choices. They are Work Choices warriors and they voted consistently to rip workers rights away. The hypocrisy of the coalition knows no bounds. Mrs Markus used her printing and communications entitlement to distribute a glossy brochure claiming that the coalition's policies and vision for Australia was to ease the pressure on families. Tell that to the public servants in the Blue Mountains and in the Hawkesbury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mrs Markus has the hide to talk about reducing the cost-of-living pressures when she stays silent on a historic and unprecedented attack on the rights and living standards of public servants in the seat of Macquarie. Mrs Markus would like to photoshop her voting record on Work Choices out of the history books. She voted to rip away workers rights on 23 occasions. Her hypocrisy knows no bounds as she has photoshopped the disgusting sexist placard that she was content to stand in front of at the 'No Carbon Tax' rally in Canberra out of her leaflet. She printed a leaflet and then she photoshopped the sexist placard right out of the leaflet, which made it untrue. That is not what happened. You have to ask yourself what Mrs Markus is about if she is prepared to do this in her leaflet to the electorate of Macquarie. She is not fair dinkum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Mrs Markus is prepared to stoop to doctoring a photograph in an attempt to mislead her electorate, then there is very little chance that she will stand up for public servants in the seat of Macquarie. With no voice of support from their state or federal member, New South Wales public servants in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury have every right to feel betrayed and abandoned by their elected representatives. Premier O'Farrell has had a very inaus­picious start to his premiership. He has had to backflip on the solar bonus scheme. He has betrayed public sector workers when during the election he argued that public sector jobs were likely to increase under the coalition and then, only days after the election, he stated that he is not ruling out job cuts. He claimed that the New South Wales government had a $4.5 billion black hole and that the former government had cooked the books. He was proved to have misled the community when the acting Treasury secretary, Michael Lambert, reported that the former government's figures 'accurately reflected the available information at the time'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The message is simple: the coalition cannot be trusted. The coalition are addicted to Work Choices and addicted to attacking working families. No matter what the coalition say prior to an election on industrial relations or job security, it will be changed if they win government. As New South Wales workers rally to defend their wages and conditions, I challenge New South Wales coalition senators and MPs to publicly reject this attack or stop the hypocrisy of purporting to be concerned about cost-of-living pressures in New South Wales.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trade union movement engaged Arthur Moses SC to advise on the constit­utionality of the proposed laws. Mr Moses advised the coalition on industrial relations while they were in opposition in New South Wales. His advice indicates that it is arguable that the changes are unconstit­utional. The proposals would render the 'commission as, in effect, an alter ego of the executive' by making it abide by government policy. Mr Moses said: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In our opinion, although not free from doubt, there are reasonable grounds upon which to conclude that [the legislation] will impair the institutional integrity of the commission so as to render its exercise of judicial power incompatible with chapter three of the Australian constitution. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decisions by the IRC would be 'challengeable', because the laws remove rights for unions to argue in front of the com­mission against government wage policy, which 'would be a denial of procedural fairness', and Mr Moses concluded that he considered 'challenges have a reasonable foundation'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The truth is that the commission, by various means, implemented the wages policy. That there was a failure to fully achieve cost offsets, if that was in fact so, is not a failure that can be sheeted home to the commission.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said that between 1995 and 2007 only the nurses and teachers had arbitrated wage claims in the commission while all other public sector wages were agreed between the government and the relevant union. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Parliament would directly fix wages and salaries for government employees rather than an independent tribunal is a novel proposition in Australia. No other state or territory does so, neither does the Commonwealth ...</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice Boland also said he was puzzled why the government kept its plans for the workplace laws a secret. I could tell Justice Boland why it was kept a secret. It was kept a secret because they would not dare tell the New South Wales community that they were going to rip the wages and conditions away from nurses, firefighters, the police, public sector workers, bus drivers and train drivers. They would not have dared do that before the election. That is why it was kept secret.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite clear that what is happening here is a rerun in New South Wales of where the federal coalition and the state coalition find their ideological base, and that is in the far right of the Republican movement in America. That is where this starts to say that public servants should not have rights to any bargaining position, that public servants should be under the complete control and at the will of the government. That is what the Republicans are doing in the United States. We know that the coalition, the Nationals and the Liberals would certainly like to replicate what the Republicans do in the United States. They are enamoured with the Tea Party extremists on climate change, enamoured with the Tea Party extremists on industrial relations, and enamoured with the Tea Party extremists on social policy. We know that the extremists in the coalition are in control. They want to rip away workers' rights. We know that if they had half a chance, they would get back to that genetic disposition of the coalition: as soon as you get any power, hoe into workers' wages and conditions, get rid of workers' rights, get rid of the penalty rates and get rid of their shift allowances. That is what the coalition are about. We know that they are simply waiting there, hoping that they can con the Australian public into thinking that they actually care about something, and as soon as they ever get to power Work Choices will be back on the agenda. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Senator Bushby loves Work Choices—he has told me time and time again. He will not defend Tasmania against the attacks from his coalition colleagues in Western Australia but he will defend Work Choices. Senator Bushby, you should put some effort into looking after Tasmania and not buckling under to the extremists in Western Australia. The same goes for the National Party. It is no good standing up and saying that you think cost of living is a problem when you want to rip and tear at workers' wages and conditions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know Work Choices is just bubbling away under the surface, ready to explode any minute, because over there the Work Choices warriors are in control. The extremists—the climate change deniers and the Work Choices warriors—in the coalition are in control. Anyone who had even a moderate approach on these issues has buckled under. They have done backflips on climate change; they have done backflips on Work Choices. The coalition in this chamber are the backflip champions. They have no backbone, no courage. They do what the leader says has to be done regardless of whether it is lies and misinformation. 'We will just run the agenda'—that is the position. They have absolutely no credibility in standing up for workers in this country and they would instigate Work Choices the first chance they got.</span>

I find it incredible that at the forefront of the policy agenda of my good friend and colleague Senator Doug Cameron at the moment is bringing about a carbon tax, which is going to destroy the fundamental standard of living of every working family. They are going to make them poorer, because apparently they can change the temperature of the globe. It is amazing—it is like living with gods, omnipotent beings! They cannot actually get fluffy stuff into the roof for the rats and mice to urinate on but they can change the temperature of the globe—incredible.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator JOYCE:</span>
                  </a>  Today I want to talk about something different. It was great to hear your valedictory speech the other day, Senator Forshaw. I think from this point forward you should shut up! The other day I was fortunate enough to go to India, and to Malaysia on the way back. What struck me whilst I was there was how important it is to make sure that in this nation we can feed ourselves. That was at the forefront of my mind. What an incredible gift it is to provide good quality food.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To provide that gift, of course, you have to have the capacity to produce the food. What produces the food in our nation is the Murray-Darling Basin. One of the other strokes of genius of the current government was to bring about a guide to a draft plan which was going to close down the Murray-Darling Basin, close down our capacity to feed ourselves. What is even more unusual is that that is something the Labor Party said they would not do—in fact, they promised they would not. They promised they would bring a triple bottom line, an equivalence of social, economic and environmental factors. But what we got was something that looked after the environment and counted the bodies later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to acknowledge that the Murray-Darling Basin produces about 40 per cent of our nation's food. It is responsible for housing about 2.1 million people. The result of the initial draft, where they talked about taking up to 7,600 gigs from the basin, was that there were almost riots, like we have never seen in this nation before, in agricultural towns throughout the basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the Labor Party's promise and the promise of my own side that we would bring about an outcome that would bring about equivalence. At times, there are anomalies within an act that mean that to fulfil a promise you have to strive for changes, amendments, if required, to an act. Therefore, I am mindful of the report that was drawn down recently by the Legal and Constitutional References Committee, <span style="font-style:italic;">A balancing act: provisions of the Water Act 2007</span>. The inquiry drew as witnesses some senior people from the legal profession, not only from Australia but elsewhere throughout the world: Professor John Briscoe from Harvard University, Professor Judith Sloan, Professor George Williams and Josephine Kelly, a barrister at law who is extremely knowledgeable about the Water Act. Their overwhelming evidence, and I will read out one of the committee's recommendations, suggested:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;" />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">The committee considers that the Water Act, as currently drafted, is uncertain and ambiguous, requiring amendment as a matter of priority to provide clarity for all concerned.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is vitally important that we start from that premise. If we are going to truly fix the problem, we must have the capacity, in a bipartisan way, to look at the act. This was also brought up by people from Mildura and from peak industry bodies and by a wide range of people involved with the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My belief at the start was that the Water Act was predominantly an environmental act for which you take into consideration social and economic outcomes. It disturbs me but also confirms my view that that is also the view of the Australian Greens, who state in their dissenting report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;" />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">The legal evidence to the inquiry is clear that, given the reliance on the external affairs power as well as the stated objects of the Water Act, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) and the Minister are required to give environmental considerations precedence in developing the Basin Plan.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the view of the Australian Greens, and I agree with them, unfortunately. For the coalition and the Australian Labor Party to deal with this issue and make sure we deliver on our promise we have to bring about amendments that give weight to our promise. The only reason the Greens issued a dissenting report is not that we disagree with the interpretation of the act but with its desirability. The difference between the Greens and us is that we believe in a triple bottom line approach; they want to deliver an extreme outcome which takes up to 7,600 gigalitres from economic use and devastates Australia's ability to feed itself. Because the government disagrees with the views of so many legal experts, it is important to outline why the act does not deliver the triple bottom line. In simple terms, the act does not do so because, while economic and social considerations are mentioned in the act, they are always 'subject to' or fettered by environmental concerns. This approach cuts across every part of the act—its objects, its purpose, its guidelines—for what the Basin Plan should include in its definition of environmentally sustainable take. In effect, this means that economic and social considerations are given substantially more weight than social and economic consider­ations under the act. Where there is a trade-off between economic, social and environ­mental issues, environmental factors are paramount; economic and social con­siderations are considered, but only after the environmentally sustainable level of take is determined. There would appear to be no scope for the MDBA to reduce cuts to water use below an environmentally sustainable level of take based on social, economic and other considerations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all consistent with the legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that we have seen thus far and the approach the MDBA took in the guide to the proposed draft Basin Plan. Indeed, after the release of the guide, the MDBA stated that, regardless of the economic and social impacts, the Water Act did not let them choose to cut water use below the minimum required for the environment—that is, below 3,000 gigalitres recommended in the guide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean in practice? It means that there is a wetland that needs 10 gigalitres of water—we heard this as evidence—and just above it is a town that needs 10 gigalitres of water. If in that wetland there is a precious frog or a sala­mander or something that requires 10 gigalitres of water and in the town there are jobs and the people that Senator Cameron talked about—working families—that also need that 10 gigalitres, and it is a choice between the working families and the frogs, guess who wins: the frogs; they get the water first. That is not a desirable outcome if you believe in a triple bottom line. That evidence was given by Josephine Kelly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To get to the bottom of this, the government needs to release all the legal advice that they currently have. If the government have nothing to hide, they should release it all. But it is clear that the government are not confident of their position. If they were they would not say things like this—this is from the Australian Labor Party—in the government's dissenting report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That advice shows that decision-making in the development of the Basin Plan involves the application of broad concepts and that there is considerable scope to consider how economic, social and environmental outcomes should be optimised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean? The Senate asked the inquiry to answer whether economic, social and environmental outcomes can be considered on a equally weighted basis. The government's report fundamentally fails to deal with this issue, preferring once more to put their spin on it and try to use these amorphous terms where 'consideration' is supposed to equal 'equality'. Of course, it does not. If you wanted me to treat you equally, you would want me to go much further than just considering what your requirements may be; you would want me to act on them. And to act on them means we must change it in the act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all about getting the balance of this plan right. We now have a report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. I would like to thank those people for the work they put into that report. I would like to thank Senator Xenophon for allowing, in his support, that inquiry to go forward. It is extremely important that we get it. None of those witnesses were unduly influenced by the government; I certainly was not involved in trying to convince Professor John Briscoe, Professor George Williams or Professor Judith Sloan what to say—they are all independent and they have basically overwhelmingly stated that, if we want to deliver on our promise, then we must be open to the amendment of the act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My suggestion to the Labor Party is this: the Australian people are looking for Labor to be independent of the Greens on some issues and have the capacity and stand up, if required, and go in to bat for the Australian working families, the 2.1 million people who live along the basin. It means that they might have to have a fight with the Greens on some of these issues to deliver what they promised, but if they do not have the ticker to stand up to the Greens then they will continue to leech votes from Labor. They will take them from the left and Labor will start to disappear, which they already are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that needs a bipartisan view: we look for people who want to work constructively together. If we can get together to try to fix this problem, it will bring a better outcome for all of those who are there. We know what will happen. We have reports going on at the moment. People are saying the words, the beautiful words, that things are going to better, but if they are not better then we will end up with the outcome challenged in the High Court. The High Court will look at the act and the act will say, 'You have to look after the environment,' and it will not matter how beautiful the words are; they will throw the outcome out until the government goes back to looking after the environment first. And then all of those riots we saw, all of those problems we saw, will re-emerge and we will be back where we started. What we want, what I want and what I am sure the Labor Party wants is an effective outcome so that we can not only continue to feed our nation but also continue to hold up our responsibility in the world in which we live, in the south-east of Asia in which we live, and assist them to be fed as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  Yesterday the Prime Minister released several glossy documents on climate change. What she was trying to expand on was the rest of the world acting in unison to come up with an overall world view that everyone was going to march to the beat of her drum. But we owe it to the people who are going to suffer from this carbon tax to have a look at what the rest of the world is going to do. The government have not been able to explain or sell their carbon tax, and consequently the polls are indicating that there is going to be a wipe out. As Senator Joyce just said: if Labor does not start listening to its constituents and it continually bows to the pressures of the Greens, it is going to get wiped out. You can see it. Those opposite have enough ability to read a poll; surely they can see that they are on the way out. Forty-five to 55: I do not know how many seats that would leave them but it would not leave them very many. I do not think they would even muster a decent opposition if they continue to go down that road. Let us look at the fact sheets. Page 1 tells us that:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear about one thing: a promise, a pledge and saying, 'In the fullness of time we may do something' is not legislation. It is a promise; it is not a commitment. Let us look at some of the countries that do have an ETS. There are only two. There is really one bunch of countries, and that is the EU. Let us look at their ETS. Ninety-eight per cent of purchased permits are free. That is since they have started. There is no tax on mining. The EU have collected $2 billion over five years. The Australian scheme will rip out of the economy—and emasculate it—$11 billion in the first year. That is the difference between an EU ETS and an Australian one. This ETS is much more vicious than anything the EU has put up. New Zealand is another case in point. They have an ETS, but they get the majority of their power from hydro, so it does not really worry them particularly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at some of these countries that are selectively looked at. The USA did not sign the Kyoto agreement. In fact, they put it up four times and it has failed every time. There is no federal cap-and-trade scheme. The clean energy standard looks likely to go to the backburner, with limited support from the congress. You can understand that. With over nine per cent unemployment, they are not going to burden the unemployed further.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact sheet also mentioned the fact that Ms Gillard claimed that there were a number of states that were going to implement some form of carbon tax. She is right, to a degree, but she failed to say that Governor Christie of New Jersey has just pulled out in the last couple of days, saying that the cap-and-trade pact does:</span>

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">... nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens, tax our businesses with no discernible all measurable impact on our environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good on him. He is speaking the truth. Canada has no ETS and is going nowhere without the USA. It has pulled out of the second-round Kyoto agreement. Korea has postponed a cap-and-trade scheme until 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at Japan, our second-biggest trading partner. The country has a voluntary scheme and has also pulled out of a second round of the Kyoto agreement, along with Russia. If you want to introduce a voluntary scheme, I will commit the National Party to it. If that is what will move to help our environment and it is a voluntary scheme, I will guarantee National Party support. Japan has a voluntary scheme. It is an absolute nonsense to compare our industry-emasculating with a voluntary scheme. The UK is part of the EU and has proposed cutting its emissions by 50 per cent by 2025 on 1990 levels. That is a proposal subject to review in 2014. It is a built-in get-out clause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">India and China proposed non-binding targets and have plans to gradually introduce a carbon tax. When? In the never-never. The fact sheet, I noticed, did not dwell on the fact that India's emissions will rise by 350 per cent by 2020 and China's levels will go up by 496 per cent by 2020. And here we are struggling to cut 1.4 per cent and just about going to emasculate our economy to get there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact sheets admit that our major competitor nations—Indonesia, Russia, Brazil, South Africa—are doing exactly nothing. It looks like these fact sheets are missing quite a few facts. On page 4 of the sheet, in a case of total desperation, we are informed—and this is a beauty; this is Brazil's contribution; this is what Brazil is going to front up with—that Brazil is going to change its public lighting and it aims to replace one million inefficient refrigerators annually. Well, good on it, but it is not an ETS. The truth is that Australia is more than pulling its weight and spending more with greater CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> abatement than any country in Europe other than the UK and Germany.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of cost as a share of GDP, Australia spends more than China, Japan, the US and South Korea. The truth is that what have around the rest of the world, other than in the EU countries which have got an ETS, is a very mild form of ETS compared with our draconian ETS. What we have is 'promises', 'in the fullness of time' and 'one day countries may do something'. But promises do not count. Right here and now the only countries that actually have an ETS are the EU and New Zealand. That is the full story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you keep going down this track—and you all can read the polls; you do not have to be geniuses; you have all been around the political scheme long enough to understand that 45 versus 55—you are going to be wiped out. You will be completely wiped out if you keep following this ETS. It is exactly like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Charge of the Light Brigade</span>: cannon to the left, cannon to the right, and here is Senator Penny Wong and Ms Gillard charging into the canon full steam ahead! 'We don't care if we get wiped out of the saddle. We are going to go through with this.' Meanwhile the polls are saying: 'Don't do it—74 per cent of the people don't want it.' But who cares about democracy? Who worries about that? 'We are determined to crash or crash through.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And you are going to crash. It is going to be the greatest train wreck ever seen in the history of political Australia. You are going to get wiped out and you have all brought it on yourselves because you have never had the guts, never had the courage and never had the gumption to stand up to the Greens. You never listen to the working class man; you never listen to the blue-collar workers. You have just ratted on them, deserted them and walked away from them, and you are getting your riding instructions from the Greens. You are going to pay the penalty. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

One, of course, is that the opposition fail to appreciate—or are ignorant of it—that abattoirs which meet OIE standards in themselves are not sufficient. It is about ensuring that we do have in place a supply chain so that we can track, and also monitor and verify, from the point of leaving the port to the point of a feedlot in Indonesia, and to the point of the slaughterhouse in Indonesia so that there is not any leakage.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />What those on the other side want to accept is that animal welfare would not be taken into account in their proposal of simply looking at an abattoir alone, because there would be leakage in the system. What those opposite are now saying, of course, is, 'Restart the trade without taking animal welfare considerations into account'. That is what the opposition are putting to the parliament today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is such a good question, you will probably get more before you leave. The federal government returned fairness and balance to the industrial relations landscape in Australia when we introduced the Fair Work Act. We introduced that act after lengthy consultations with all industrial parties because we understand that the industrial relations system must provide a fair framework for both employers and employees. The Fair Work Act provided a balanced framework for delivering fair and productive workplaces, and at the heart of the system is enterprise bargaining based on the principle of good-faith negotiation. I am pleased that thousands of employers and their employees are getting on with the business of bargaining under the Fair Work Act.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If a party fails to bargain in good faith, both the union and the employer can ask Fair Work Australia, the independent umpire, for assistance in dealing with a bargaining dispute. In stark contrast, the legislation being introduced by the New South Wales government seeks to undermine the checks and balances this government put in place and to deny public-sector workers the rights enjoyed by all other Australian workers. Their bill seeks to treat those government workers in New South Wales as second-class citizens.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. The New South Wales Liberal Party bill requires New South Wales Industrial Relations to enforce government policy declared by regulation relating to wages and conditions of employment not just for New South Wales public-sector workers but for a broader definition including teachers, nurses and firefighters. While the current focus of the bill is on capping pay rises, it allows the government to unilaterally set the wages and conditions of all its public-sector employees. It reduces the independent umpire to a rubber stamp for the government wages policy, regardless of what the policy dictates. New South Wales workers will be second-class citizens with no rights to an independent umpire.</span>

This is the first time we have heard from the coalition on this legislation. If the coalition were genuine, they would be expressing their concern about what Premier O'Farrell is doing. They would be standing up for hardworking Australians, defending their rights to be part of a bargaining process and defending their rights to have access to an industrial tribunal.</span>

The New South Wales Liberal Party is implementing the sort of policy that the Liberals in this chamber support: denying workers' rights, taking their advice from the HR Nicholls Society—who, by the way, have brought back Ian Hanke—and bringing back Peter Reith to be president.

In addition to that, I met with Animals Australia on 30 November 2010, where evidence was presented. Those areas are across the live animal export area in the Middle East. I wrote to industry in January—I think you will recall this—requesting Meat and Livestock Australia look at the footage to work through some of these animal welfare issues. It is an area where I have been very strong with industry, talking to industry about animal welfare issues and ensuring that they provide a path forward to assist the industry.</span>

Since then there has been no—to my knowledge or to my office's knowledge; I can check on that if you like—additional footage that has been brought forward or evidence that I can act on. As I indicated, I clearly acted on the footage from ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>. I implemented a ban on 12 of those facilities in Indonesia and subsequently, as we now know, I suspended the trade in live animal exports. In addition to that, the government shares the community's concerns about animal welfare and is taking the necessary action to provide a secure future for the live export trade. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Can the minister tell the chamber if a Tasmanian forest agreement is in the offing and, indeed, may be finalised in the next fortnight? Can the minister reassure the public, who have just seen cuts right across the board, that there will not be any money going to a private enterprise pulp mill in Tasmania from the public purse, either directly or indirectly, or to the Malaysian logging company Ta Ann?</span>

I think that is an important point to make in this area. It is not an agreement between governments. The Gillard Labor government has welcomed this landmark statement and believes it is important that we play a constructive role in supporting this significant community led initiative. As you are aware, this government together with the Tasmanian government appointed Mr Bill Kelty as an independent facilitator to work with the signatories to this community led statement to help build on the imple­mentation. The Gillard government remains committed to working with the Tasmanian community. The community agreement has not yet been finalised, but the government continues to work with the stakeholders in the statement of principles for that purpose.</span>

                  </a>  The government understands there is community concern about the proposed pulp mill at Bell Bay but recognises that the mill at Bell Bay will provide sustainable jobs and opportunities for the community of Northern Tasmania. The mill has undergone a rigorous federal environmental approval process under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The government is not considering any funding support for the Gunns mill at this time. Similarly I am advised that the government has not received any request from Gunns for funding support in relation to the mill or its business structure. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Is the process under pressure from Ta Ann, the Malaysian owned logging company, to reduce that area so that it can continue to log in areas of high conservation value forest which are determined for protection? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Some of those matters fall within other areas, and I am not trying to avoid answering the question. That part of the question that this portfolio can respond to I will take on notice. Some of it will definitely fall within the relevant Tasmanian state government's responsibility, and some parts of it will fall within the department of environment.

This was passed into law earlier this year and will apply from 1 July, just a couple of weeks from now. We understand that exit fees are one of the biggest barriers to competition in the banking system. If the opposition do not believe us, perhaps they might listen to consumers and perhaps they might listen to Choice, who said that banning exit fees 'is about giving power back to the most important people in Australia's banking sector—consumers'. Unfortunately, for those opposite the most important people in the banking sector are clearly not Australian consumers.

Unfortun­ately, there have been some who have suggested that the ban on exit fees should only apply to the big banks and that all other lenders should be exempted. However, the fact is that unfortunately it is some of the smaller wholesale lenders who are actually those who charge mortgage exit fees as high as $7,000 to lock their customers in. Exempting those lenders, as the opposition is calling for, would mean Australian con­sumers who take out loans with those lenders could be locked in. They would not be able to move even if it were otherwise financially sensible for them to do so. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

One of the streams of the government's banking reform package was dedicated to supporting smaller lenders. This included investment in the residential mortgage backed securities market of some $20 billion, and we know that smaller lenders rely heavily on the RMBS market to fund their lending. But the fact is those opposite cannot hide behind the argument about smaller lenders when they have a government that has stepped in to assist that sector. They cannot hide behind the argu­ment around smaller lenders because the reality is that what they are actually arguing for is barriers to competition. That is exactly what the opposition are arguing for—they want Australian consumers to pay higher exit fees. The question is this: why are the opposition so intent on demanding that Australian consumers pay more fees? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This is inaccurate. The government recognises that the coal industry is a vital part of our economy. It is a particularly vital part of our economy. The vast majority of Australia's coalmining industry is not emissions intensive and will face materially increased costs under a carbon price. As to the DLP, I cannot go to that issue, clearly.</span>

The story was followed on the national program last night. The reports detailed allegations of fraud and the dangerous installation of rooftop solar power systems that were sold by True Value Solar and installed by a separate company called Solar Installation Australia. The systems installed attracted federal government rebates under the government's renewable energy certificates scheme. Specifically, the report contained allegations from former staff of these businesses that paperwork sent to the government contained forged sig­natures and fraudulent information. <span style="font-style:italic;">Today Tonight </span>obtained copies of the fraudulent documents. My question to the minister is: how can there be public confidence in the validity and accuracy of documentation forwarded to the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator by solar companies claiming solar credits? Has the government inquired further into these serious allegations concerning the rorting of a federal government scheme?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and Deregulation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  I thank Senator Xenophon for the question. There are two aspects, the first in relation to broader compliance and probity systems and the second in relation to the particular firm True Value Solar. On the second issue what I can indicate, and I understand this is on the ORER website, is that the business True Value Solar has agreed to an enforceable undertaking. This correlates with the regulator's compliance and enforcement policy. It is an undertaking which I understand has been made public and the details of it are on the website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the broader issue of compliance and probity regimes under the renewable energy target it is the case over the last 12 months that the government has significantly strengthened requirements for government assistance for solar installations under the federal scheme—that is, the renewable energy target—to further protect consumers and also to assist states and territories in the enforcement of laws and to support industry accreditation through the Clean Energy Council. There is a requirement for CEC accredited installers and in addition there is a range of standards and requirements which need to be signed off for certificates to be created. An additional inspection regime, I am advised, has been established to identify breaches of standards and to properly pass this information to state and territory enforce­ment agencies responsible for electrical safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes have significantly strength­ened requirements originally put in place by the Howard government and address limitations in enforcement powers to give the regulator a wide range of measures to take action where systems do not comply. There are a number of matters that the regulator engages in to minimise the creation of non-compliant renewable energy scheme certificates.

In that period the South Australian Office of the Technical Regulator has carried out its inspections on just 50 of those systems. Given the allegations of shoddy workmanship and dangerous wiring of households and the fact that Commonwealth money is supporting the scheme, does the minister believe this level of inspection is adequate?</span>

                  </a>  I am trying, Mr President. But there are a great many interjections from that side and I can understand why because on this issue it is somewhat embarrassing the extent of the division on that side, including by Senator Humphries. I am surprised that Senator Humphries is even asking this question. I thought he was one of the few on that side who actually thought climate change was real. The government has been very clear in its approach to action on climate change: that a carbon price is the cheapest, fairest way to ensure we reduce the carbon pollution that is causing climate change or contributing to climate change and also to drive investment in a clean energy future. It is the case that we have said the carbon price will be paid by less than a thousand of the largest polluters for every tonne of pollution they emit and that we will take every cent taken from the big polluters to provide generous household assistance, to help with family budgets, to protect jobs as businesses make the transition to a clean energy economy, and to tackle climate change including by investing in new and clean technology.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, a point of order on the question of relevance: the minister has only 20 seconds to go. She has been going for one minute and 40 seconds and she has not anywhere near approached the topic of the question—that is, what proposals the government has for the compensation of fixed income earners, in particular self-funded retirees. Abuse of the opposition and a recitation of the general principles behind the government's policy are not directly relevant. It was a narrow and specific question and it ought to be answered.</span>

How is that fair? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The guarantee that those opposite fail to see is the guarantee that they cannot provide when it comes to the $30 billion they will take out of taxpayers' pockets to give to the biggest polluters in Australia. That is the cost of your policy. As Mr Turnbull said, it is a policy that is inefficient, that is a recipe for fiscal recklessness and that takes from taxpayers and gives to polluters without any guarantee that Australia's pollution will actually drop.

                  </a>  We have been clear about why we need to take action on climate change, and that is that all of us lose, including future generations, if we do not. Those opposite might want to play politics with this issue and dismiss the science. Senator Bernardi might want to talk about the conspiracy of scientists. But, funda­mentally, in five, 10 or 20 years time people will look back at some of the arguments by those opposite, who are so irresponsible about the importance of this issue, so irresponsible about the burden we are imposing. If we do not act, our children and grandchildren will judge us very harshly. We will do this responsibly and we will ensure that the money paid by big polluters is returned for the purposes I have outlined. That is the responsible path. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This announcement represents almost 40 per cent of national construction activity planned over the next two years with pricing in line with the NBN Co.'s corporate plan. Importantly, this contract means that more and more Australian households will begin to reap the benefits of being connected to the NBN. This government recognises that investing in the NBN is about future-proofing Australia's future economic prosperity, its international competitiveness and its social wellbeing. I am confident that this deal represents good value for taxpayers and that the NBN Co. will continue to deliver the NBN on budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am happy to advise the chamber that on 1 June NBN Co. announced that it entered into a 10-year contract with Ericsson to design, build and operate a 4G fixed-wireless network worth up to $1.1 million. Construction of the fixed-wireless network will commence in December this year and is expected to be completed by 2015. It will deliver peak speeds of at least 12 megabits per second from the middle of next year, ensuring an end-user experience far in excess of what people in rural Australia have been forced to put up with, or would have been forced to put up with, with that dog of an Opel product that those opposite championed for so long.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Small Business (Senator Sherry) and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senators McGauran and Humphries today relating to the coal industry and a proposed carbon tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate about the government's proposed carbon tax is not about the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. All major parties in this place agree, at least on the basis of risk management and minimisation, that action should be taken to reduce global emissions. The principle that is often termed the 'precautionary principle' is applied.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No, this debate is about whether the method proposed by the government, its carbon tax, which it went to the election promising it would not introduce, will actually achieve this reduction and at what cost to Australians. The fact is that even on the little that we currently know about what the Labor-Green government proposes for this carbon tax, it is not likely to reduce global emissions; in fact it may even increase global emissions. And it will come at great cost to Australians and Australians' jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is often said that Australia has the highest per capita emissions, and maybe that is the case. I think there is conflicting evidence out there as to who actually does have the highest emissions, but certainly we are amongst the highest emitters in the world on a per capita basis. That is primarily because we do not use nuclear power and because we have access to a huge, cheap and efficient coal resource, which we make good use of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what of this? How does this work into the global task of reducing emissions? If we start on the basis that we and others in the world should be able to maintain and even grow our standard of living, then we need to assume that we will on a global basis still need to produce and manufacture an equivalent amount of goods and services to that we manufacture now. So surely in doing that, in manufacturing that equivalent amount of goods and services, we should be doing it in the most efficient manner at a global level and in a way that will reduce global emissions, not increase them. As such, if we can produce a tonne of aluminium or concrete or steel in Australia with the lowest or near-lowest emissions in the world, then surely this is a good place to produce that even if it increases the emissions per Australian as it will decrease the emissions per person on the planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we are arguing for a global solution to a global problem and not one where Australia solely takes the lead in a way that costs Australians and delivers nothing for the environment. Notions of leading may sound nice. They may even make some people sleep better at night and feel a little bit warm and fuzzy. But what must be the key in addressing the issue of global warming is that we impose a global solution. Imposing additional costs that make it uneconomic to produce goods and services in Australia, leading to carbon leakage, just makes no sense whatsoever. It does not fix the problem yet it will cost jobs in Australia and increase the cost of living. Even Senator Wong agrees with this. In a speech at an AiG luncheon on 6 February 2008, the then Australian climate change minister stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The introduction of a carbon price ahead of effective international action can lead to perverse incentives for such industries to relocate or source production offshore. There is no point in imposing a carbon price domestically which results in emissions and production transferring internationally for no environmental gain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past few years, we have seen a lot of independent modelling on the impacts of an ETS, and now a carbon tax, on specific industries. Almost all of these have highlighted that there would be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of jobs lost in those industries. Just in the last couple of days we have seen independent modelling released by the Australian Coal Association, to which Senator Sherry referred, looking at the impacts on their industry. It was conducted, I would note, independently by the ACIL Tasman modelling group. They found that carbon pricing could greatly reduce the expected boost to the economy from the resources boom as potential mines do not go ahead. That in itself is interesting because we have heard a lot about how this government will return the budget to surplus in 2013-14 based on conservatively high terms of trade. If the ACIL Tasman modelling is correct, the carbon tax will have a serious impact on any future boost to the economy from the resources boom from coal mines alone, which will upset the assumptions on terms of trade and will upset the likelihood of a surplus in a few years time. If that is correct just for the coal industry, imagine the impact it will have on industries economy wide.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report estimates that between 22,700 and 31,020 man years of jobs will be forgone as a result of new projects not proceeding and that between $23 billion and $45 billion in export earnings will be forgone in the decade to 2021-22. They say:</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CROSSIN:</span>
                  </a>  We continue to have the battles with the deniers and the sceptics, Senator Bernardi, sitting opposite us, who pretend that they do not need to do anything and that nothing has happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions as part of global action. There have been comments made about that over a number of weeks and months. Yesterday, the Prime Minister released some fact sheets to show that Australia is not alone here, that plenty of countries have policies and initiatives to take action on climate change. We have determined that the best way to achieve this is through putting a price on carbon, a price that will allow businesses to make decisions on how to best manage their emissions, including through investments in low-emission technologies, while meeting Australia's energy security needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The equation is very simple. A price on carbon will encourage large polluters and business to change the way they operate and to reduce their high-emission technologies. I note that the business sector more broadly remains supportive of a carbon price to reduce long-term investment uncertainty. So we do have businesses that are starting to get on board and want to be part of this debate, this discussion, this negotiation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that the coal industry is a vital part of our economy. The vast majority of Australia's coal-mining industry is not emissions intensive and will not face materially increased costs under a carbon price. However, there are a small number of gassy underground mines that have high fugitive methane emissions, and they will face increased costs. They know that and we know that. That is why we are consulting closely with the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee on assistance measures for these coal-mining operations, including nego­tiating with them to come up with a way to deal with this. We remain committed to assuring the competitiveness of our mining sector through all of these negotiations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to the issues that Senator Bushby raised in terms of the ACIL Tasman report on coal-mining jobs. Certainly under a carbon price we expect to see strong growth in the economy, in jobs and in average incomes. We expect that that growth will be particularly strong in the resources sector. The latest capex numbers show that busin­esses are confidently investing in growing their operations. Based on ABARE's estimates, the total investment pipeline for coal alone was over $72 billion as at April 2011. The pipeline of investment for the broader resources sector reached a remarkable $430 billion in April. So many of our largest resources companies have made it clear that they support a price on carbon. Companies like Santos, Shell, BP, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton support a price on carbon. They are on board. It is a shame the people opposite are not. Those companies know that we need to reduce contribute pollution and want to be part of that solution and part of that dialogue. Putting a price on carbon is the cheapest and most effective way to do this, so many of these big investors have already built a carbon price into their investment plans. So what do we have before us? A bright future for sectors like coal and LNG. It is true that the carbon price will affect some operators, but we are working with industry on an assistance package that will manage that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  In hearing Senator Crossin's speech, and Senator Wong's statements earlier during question time, I am reminded of the great showman PT Barnum who said something like, 'You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time.' Senator Crossin and Senator Wong are clearly part of that group that can be fooled all of the time. They are defending what this government cannot defend with any strength or temerity. The reason is this government was elected with a promise not to introduce a price on carbon and, more specifically, not to introduce a price on carbon dioxide—that odourless gas which we all expire when we talk and exhale. Senator Crossin will repeat the myths and the suggestions that carbon is pollution when actually we are talking about carbon dioxide. She will repeat the assurance that business wants certainty. Well, they had certainty at the last election when her Prime Minister promised not to introduce a price on carbon dioxide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is conveniently forgotten in their self-perpetuating infliction of misery on the Australian people. Make no mistake, Mr Deputy President, the Australian people are struggling with cost-of-living pressures right now. They are worried about hanging onto their jobs and they are worried about how they are going to pay their electricity bills and their gas bills. They are worried about the cost of fruit and vegetables. They are worried about the cost of transport. And this government is only worried about taking more money out of Australian families' pockets. That is an absolute disgrace. The reason they are doing it is because they are sending this country broke, unfortunately quite rapidly with $50,000 million worth of additional debt to be incurred in the next 12 months alone. Many people will say that is the government living for today by mortgaging the future. This government does not care about that. I glance around this chamber now, look up in the gallery and see the future of Australia having a look at what is happening. The children up there do not realise that the myths being pedalled by this government are going to result in all of them paying much more tax for the next several decades. This is an appalling indictment on the management of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also dressed up in that cloak of environmentalism in which it says, 'We're going to save the planet from climate change or global warming.' And yet when pushed, when this government is asked how much this massive new tax, which is going to start at around $12 billion next year and grow every year after that in perpetuity, is going to change the temperature, it will not answer. It cannot answer. Even its self-appointed climate change spokesman, the man who has a reputation for creating more myths than anyone else in the country, is getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to peddle nonsense—even though it has been proved incorrect time and time again. So when it cannot answer the questions, when it will not provide the detail, when it is putting enor­mous pressure on Australian families simply through a self-indulgent reluctance to reduce its expenditure and to live within its means and to cut its cloth, like every family in this country does, we should be appalled. The Australian people should be appalled. Indeed they are, because most Australians today do not buy what this government is peddling. They do not buy it because there is no credibility attached to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister, Senator Wong, today in answering the questions is on the record as saying a carbon tax is less efficient, that it is not a silver bullet. She tried to put forward all of the same sort of rhetoric and nonsense once before in getting up her emissions trading scheme, which would have destroyed the economy and the country. Then she went off to Copenhagen, proclaimed it a great success, came back and ditched her policy. Why should we believe her now? It is the same Penny Wong who is lecturing us on fiscal conservatism and being responsible economic managers as she spends $50,000 million more of taxpayers' money than they are going to take. That is what this is all about: a government that cannot control its spending; it cannot control its tortured distortion of the truth in order to peddle its ideological and obsessive regime to indoctrinate and get itself involved in everyone's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They want both of their hands in our pockets, and the Australian people cannot afford it. They cannot afford it and they cannot afford to put up with more of the myths and lies masquerading as policy that this government continues to generate. They should stand condemned, and the Australian people will render their verdict at the next election.</span>

                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-Time"> (Western Australia) (15:19):</span>  Sometimes in a debate you really do have to have someone who tries to avoid the hyperbole and the exaggeration and the political pointscoring and the Chicken Little statements that we have had from the two opposition speakers to date—someone who is prepared to address the issue at hand, the facts in a debate. Fortunately for the chamber, I am the person who is more than comfortable to address just the facts concerning the climate change issue and the carbon tax debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go right back to the beginning, to basics. Some six or nine months ago, the Prime Minister made it quite clear that we were going to introduce a carbon tax. She made it quite clear at the time as to why we were seeking to introduce a carbon tax: to cut pollution and to drive investment in clean energy. She also made the point at the time, and has repeated it regularly since, as has the relevant minister, that there would be some modest cost impact through the imposition of the carbon tax. Of course, that modest cost impact will be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the companies that are the largest emitters in industry around the Commonwealth of Australia. So, yes, there was going to be a carbon tax. It was there to cut pollution and to drive investment in clean energy. It would have modest cost impacts, and those modest cost impacts would be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the largest emitters, the largest polluters, in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledged at the outset that some industries would pass on all or part of that cost to consumers, and we also said at the outset that it would be terribly unfair that those who are least fortunate in our community, those who are least able to bear the cost, should wear that cost from that modest cost impact. That is why we said up-front that the cost impact would be modest and that there would be fair and generous assistance to households. The government made its position quite clear at the outset and time and time again the relevant minister has repeated that. We said that we would help pensioners and we would help low-income earners. But, more than that, it is not a revenue grab, a revenue take, a revenue steal, as Senator Bernardi constantly recited; 100 per cent of the revenue raised from this carbon tax will be returned to industry, to consumers or to those low-income house­holds around Australia—pensioners and low-income persons generally—who are least able to bear that price. Almost 3½ million maximum-rate and part-rate pensioners will receive assistance—assistance in addition to the normal indexation of their pension and their welfare entitlements—to compensate them for the burden that they will wear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We say that the approach of the government will have the outcome that the carbon price, which is a price on emissions and pollution, will make dirty energy more expensive and clean energy, like the alternatives we have been talking about for some time—solar, wind and gas—cheaper. In that context, as I said, the tax is only going to fall on the largest 1,000 emitters in this country. Some of those emitters will have the ability to pass on the price increase—some in whole, some in part. But we are very concerned about where it is passed on. We have been concerned from the outset that it does not fall unfairly on those parts of the community least able to bear it. That is why we said up-front that there is going to be significant compensation to low-income families, there is going to be significant compensation to low-income households and there is going to be significant compensation to those who are on the pension—whether on a part pension or on a full pension. That is going to be done in addition, as I said before, to the normal indexation requirements that pensioners enjoy when their pension goes up on a regular basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are about having a sustainable economy, efficient industries, growth in the economy, additional jobs, less pollution and less pollutants, and we are about having altered energy supplies and alternate energy firms— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It would be remiss of me not to note Senator Crossin's remarks in relation to the advertisements that carbon tax supporters are placing in papers around the country. She suggested that this was indica­tive of the tremendous support that the carbon tax has. To Senator Crossin, who I wish was in this chamber to hear this directly and had not left, I can only say: those who are advertising in those media outlets today must be some of the one-third left of Gillard supporters. We have seen Prime Minister Gillard's personal support plummet; it has crashed. They must be the last remaining few who still believe her and support her. There aren't many of them left.</span>

What sort of hypocrisy is that? What gobsmacking hypocrisy! It is those in government, those on the government benches, who have been playing politics with this issue, because we did not have a carbon tax on the table until Prime Minister Gillard did a deal with the Leader of the Greens, Bob Brown, to form government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So said Julia Gillard, the then minister. I say to her: what happened to her election promise that there would be no carbon tax under any government that she led? That promise went up in smoke when she formed an alliance with the Greens. That is what happened to that promise. So the suggestion that the opposition are playing politics with this is total hypocrisy. It is the government that have been playing politics with it. We would not be considering a carbon tax today if they had not formed an alliance with the Greens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that goes to the very heart of the problems that the government are facing and that they are facing in the Labor Party as a party. We have had the senior elder statesman, Senator John Faulkner, as recently as today discussing the fact that the government are poll driven—their whole direction is based on pollster results. They have lost sight of what their membership want. They have lost sight of what their caucus want. We have the Socialist Left leader, Senator Doug Cameron, breaking out and wanting to exercise a public voice because he feels he has no voice in the caucus. It is those problems which are driving the fact that we have a government that is not only not listening to its own members, backbenchers or caucus: this government is not listening to the Australian public. The government only has to pick up a newspaper to see that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The very next day I, as the Australian Greens spokesperson for animal welfare, announced a two-pronged approach to ending live export, calling for the immediate suspension of export licences, followed by a legislated ban on live exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It took the minister days to announce a ban on exports to 11 identified abattoirs and days again still to announce a suspension of all cattle exports to Indonesia. The Australian Greens support the ban of exports to Indonesia. Indonesia has no domestic animal protection laws to enforce mandatory stunning or OIE guidelines, and enforcement of standards in over 4000 slaughter locations across Indonesia will be near impossible and very costly. Indonesia is already a signatory to the OIE and Australia has no power to make Indonesia comply with these guidelines. OIE guidelines are minimal standards for developing countries that allow practices that are illegal in Australia to take place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a Senator for Western Australia I have a particular interest in this industry. On average, 180,000 cattle are exported from WA to Indonesia from the WA ports of Broome, Fremantle, Geraldton and Wyndham. In 2010 a total of 170,555 cattle were exported to Indonesia from Western Australia. Already this year, 7,010 cattle have been exported to Indonesia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why I have introduced this bill. The Live Animal Export (Slaughter) Prohibition Bill 2011 amends the Export Control Act 1982 to prohibit the export of live animals for slaughter. The bill provides definitions of livestock and livestock for slaughter to limit the application of the bill to livestock, as defined in section 3 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 as cattle, calves, sheep, lambs, goats or other prescribed animals, that is intended to be exported and slaughtered overseas. The ban will be in place immediately, with no delay and no continued cruelty. My colleague, Adam Bandt MP, will be introducing the same bill in the House of Representatives in order to maintain pressure on the government to take swift action to end the trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The footage shown on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> was provided by Animals Australia investigators who visited 10 abattoirs in four Indonesian cities in March 2011. The RSPCA then conducted a full scientific assessment of the evidence from this investigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6.4 million Australian cattle have been sent to these conditions in Indonesia over the last 20 years. The cattle travel from northern Australia to Indonesia in ships with 2,000-3,000 head capacity and the trip can take between 5-10 days, with between one and five animals dying during each shipment from injury, heat stress or pneumonia. Cattle are then feed-lotted in Indonesia for 90 days before being trucked to slaughter. Cattle in Australia are stunned prior to slaughter, including those cattle for the halal-certified export market, but in Indonesia less than 10% of cattle are stunned before having their throats cut, meaning the vast majority of cattle are fully conscious when their throat is cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence collected by these two peak animal welfare organisations, Animals Australia and RSPCA, shows that the Mark I cattle restraint devices, which were commissioned under the Meat and Livestock Australia &amp; Livecorp program, facilitate Australian cattle being subjected to cruel practices. The industry program installed 109 of these devices in Indonesia abattoirs since 2001 and was subsidised to the tune of $1.2 million in taxpayer funds. The restraints enable a method of slaughter that trips the animals onto their sides, allowing their throat to be cut. As Animals Australia and the RSPCA state "footage shows terrified animals falling violently onto a sloping concrete slab and during the process of trying to get up crashing their heads and faces against the sharp edge of a concrete blood drain. The force of these blows has chipped away at the cement and has been known to break jaws".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Serious questions need to be asked about the roles of organisations as Meat and Livestock Australia and LiveCorp. MLA has received $5 per head of cattle exported to address animal welfare issues–clearly that has not happened appropriately. The Australian Greens will be moving to have this issue examined by the Rural Affairs and Transport Committee to determine how it was allowed to eventuate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With around 100 abattoirs in operation in Indonesia taking Australian cattle, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program was not highlighting a one-off or an isolated incident. This is widespread, systemic and appalling mistreatment. Previous investigations by Animals Australia have shown equally cruel treatment of Australian animals, for example cattle in Egypt in 2006, sheep in Kuwait in 2010 and 2003, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Jordan in 2007. The evidence is mounting that no matter what animal or what country we export to we cannot guarantee that those Australian animals will be treated humanely at standards which Australians expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The sheer numbers of animals involved in this industry are astounding. Between 2008 – 2010 approximately 2,697,569 cattle were exported from Australia, in the same three years 10,751,169 sheep were exported and 254,798 goats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The range of countries to which animals are exported is also vast. Sheep are exported from Fremantle, Portland and Port Adelaide to Kuwait, Jordan, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Breeder cattle are exported from Darwin, Fremantle and Broome to Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Jordan, Japan, Israel and Brunei. Goats are exported from Adelaide, Fremantle and Sydney to Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius and Brunei.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Exporting Australian animals to the type of conditions we consistently witness is not acceptable. The Australian Greens propose that we need to be looking at how to improve and increase processing in Australia to support local producers and jobs. The community benefits of processing meat in Australia have been underestimated for too long and are being talked down by the live export industry. An ACIL Tasman report in 2009 found that the phasing out of live sheep exports would have a minimal impact of farmers. A 2010 report, commissioned by Australia's leading meat processors, found that live cattle exports compete with and undermine Australia's domestic beef industry leading to lost processing opportunities in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Processing animals in Australia protects them from inhumane treatment and ensures our laws and standards regarding animal welfare can be upheld.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By growing our meat export trade we can create more local jobs, support communities and maintain economic viability for producers. We should be investing in these economic opportunities rather than maintaining the live export trade which sees animals being treated so badly once they leave our shores.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens will continue to call for an immediate ban on all live exports until the cows, sheep and goats come home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death and disease in Australia, accounting for approximately 15,500 deaths per annum. Tobacco also has a massive social cost for Australia, calculated at over $30 billion per year even when the tobacco excise is taken into account. The revenue from tobacco tax does not come close to covering the social costs of tobacco use to our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia’s tobacco control achievements over the past decades have been substantial. Tobacco control measures have prevented a significant number of premature deaths, and saved far more in health and other costs than the amount spent on the measures themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such measures include restricting the advertising of tobacco products, increasing the excise on tobacco products and now the government’s plans to mandate plain packaging for all cigarettes sold in Australia by 1 July 2012, which the Greens support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And yet we still allow tobacco companies to donate to political parties in Australia. In fact tobacco companies have a history of donating to major political parties. This practice is untenable and the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Tobacco Industry Donations) Bill 2011 seeks to remedy this situation by banning political donations from the tobacco industry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently the only legislation in Australia prohibiting political donations from tobacco companies is in New South Wales due to major reforms to the state’s political funding and disclosure legislation passed last year. The changes commenced on 1 January 2011 and reflect amendments proposed by the NSW Greens to include prohibitions on donations from a range of players, including tobacco industry business entities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2004 the Australian Labor Party com­mendably stopped accepting donations from the tobacco industry. However, the Liberal and National parties continue to accept money from big tobacco. Between 2005 and 2010, the Liberals and Nationals received a combined total of over $1.4 million from the two major tobacco companies—British American and Philip Morris. By its own admission, British American Tobacco states that on the issue of political donations, 'such payments can only be made for the purpose of influencing the debate on issues.'</span>

Furthermore, individual federal Liberal MPs have stated their opposition to their party accepting donations from big tobacco, and are now publicly calling on their leader Mr Abbott to end this appalling practice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is Greens' policy that there should be public funding of elections to eliminate corporate funding, with the exception of small donations by individuals.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee has raised three issues under Standing Order 24 in relation to the Migration (Character Test) Bill. These all give rise to concerns that provisions in the bill may trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first concern is that the proposed increase in penalty from 3 years to 5 years for the use of a 'weapon' may be disproportionate because the definition of 'weapon' is so broad that a person could be found to threaten to use a thing to inflict bodily injury without there being any real or significant risk that injury may in fact result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second concern is that the current 'character test' provisions already allow past and present criminal conduct to be taken into account and the new provisions could lead to circum­stances in which relatively minor criminal behaviour is used to justify the exercise of these powers without the need for any assessment of the circumstances and details of the offence. Again, the Scrutiny Committee is concerned about whether this is a proportionate response. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The third concern relates to the com­mencement of the 'character test'  provisions. The bill provides that they will operate from 26 April, which is the date on which the Minister announ­ced his intention to make these changes. This means that the 'character test' provisions will operate retrospectively, even though the laws could have serious consequences for individuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee consistently draws attention to reliance on Ministerial announcements which contain an implicit requirement that persons arrange their affairs in accordance with such announcements rather than in accordance with the law. This approach undermines the principle that the law is made by Parliament, not by the Executive. The practice is of particular concern in the context of the application of laws which have the capacity to affect significant individual interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee will seek further information from the Minister about the need for these provisions. In addition, if the 'character test' provisions are considered indispensible, the Committee will request advice about whether it is appropriate to at least limit the types of offences or to specify a minimum term of imprisonment applying to the relevant offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee would also like to draw the Senate's attention to its comments in Alert Digest No. 5 on Appropriation Bill No. 2. This Bill is usually for Budget appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund that are not the ordinary annual services of government, but this year it also includes amendments to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee is concerned to ensure that the CIS Act amendments receive sufficient parlia­mentary scrutiny and therefore brings these provisions to the attention of Senators. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to its Fifth Report, the Committee has continuing concerns regarding the Child Support Amendment Bill. A key provision of the bill provides capacity for the Child Support Registrar to delegate all powers and functions to perform his or her duties, including to persons outside the Australian Public Service. The justification for the provision is that it seeks to enable more efficient service delivery, including allowing for the outsourcing of debt collection services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee previously raised concerns about the breadth of the delegation and that it may have the effect of limiting the application of administrative and judicial review and complaint mechanisms in respect of delegations to persons outside the public service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In her reply the Minister responded to the issues raised, including expressing the view that the delegation would not change availability of administrative review, that review mechanisms provided by the Act would remain subject to judicial review, and the Registrar would retain a power to review and alter decisions of a delegate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee thanks the Minister for her response, but remains concerned about the extent and scope of the delegation. The Committee is also not certain that outsourcing to persons outside the public service would, in all circumstances, remain subject to judicial review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee will seek further advice from the Minister about the proposed delegation power, including whether consideration can be given to the provision of more specific powers of delegation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to scrutiny concerns raised in previous Digests, the Committee has received replies to the issues it raised in relation to the  Customs Amendment (Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Bill and the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Bill. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, this report considers three significant bilateral agreements, and two instruments amending treaties to which Australia is already party. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of particular interest to Australia’s Slovak community will be the new social security agreement to provide pension portability between our two nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The agreement with the Slovak Republic follows a model successfully implemented with some 24 other countries. Such agreements aim to increase retirement incomes for migrants who have spent part of their working lives in either country, and deliver greater choice of residency for all benefit recipients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this agreement, over half of the Slovak Republic aged pensioners in Australia will qualify for entitlements accrued in their homeland for the first time. Australia in turn will have a net social security benefit, as pensions paid here will be offset against Slovak provided funds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Agreement also provides that superannuation and pension requirements are due in only one nation at a time. This cuts costs for employers and opens employment and business opportunities in both nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, another treaty in this report represents, in my opinion, a landmark negotiation for law enforcement and co-operation in our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The prisoner transfer treaty between Australia and the People’s Republic of China provides a framework of rights and protections for Australian and Chinese nationals seeking to transfer from correctional institutions in the other nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given past human rights concerns, it is important to note that no prisoner will be compelled to transfer. The treaty requires that all parties involved consent to the transfer, and that prisoner are fully informed in writing of all the legal implications.A mandatory requirement under transfer agreements is that the Receiving Party enforces the full term of the original sentence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Department representatives advised, however, that there is flexibility. The served term may be adjusted through the use of non parole periods, for example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This provides an important opportunity to reduce sentences of excessive length by Australian standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, the Committee understands that this treaty with PRC has been a long term priority for Government; yet it is two years since China formally advised it had domestic arrangements in place for its ratification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee urges ratification and implementation of this treaty, to avoid any further hardship for Australians held in China and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The other bilateral agreement dealt with in this report introduces new co production opportunities for film, television and digital media in Australia and South Africa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Agreements like these should excite Australians, as they do the Committee, given the potential for rich cultural exchange and boosted production activity between two vital media industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, I draw attention to the proposed amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South East Asia</span>, and to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Singapore</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australia Free Trade Agreement</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Treaty of Amity is an important vehicle for Australia’s engagement with ASEAN. The Third Protocol amending the Treaty opens accession to regional organisations like the European Union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee welcomes this forward-looking gesture, which demonstrates ASEAN’s willingness to engage beyond the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the Singapore Free Trade Agreement were minor in nature, but the Committee notes in consideration that even minor changes can have major implications. Amend­ments to annotations, for example, dealt with telecommunication regulation in an increasingly competitive international market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, to conclude: the treaty actions in Report 117 are not controversial, but neither are they inconsequential to Australia’s national interests. They all have the Committee’s unqualified support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, today I present on behalf of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee the first report of its inquiry into the Australian privacy amend­ment legislation. This report examines the exposure draft of the Australian Privacy Principles, which are the first stage of the government's planned reforms to enhance the protection of personal privacy in Australia. The government has recognised that the current Privacy Act may not be adequate to protect personal information that is gathered, stored and shared in today's world. Vast quantities of personal information are now transmitted electronically, and many Australians are concerned about the security of that information. As a first step in the reform process, the government requested the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the Privacy Act. The ALRC took 28 months to complete its review and addressed a multitude of issues in its three-volume report. The government accepted the maj­ority of the ALRC's recommendations in relation to the Privacy Principles. The Privacy Principles exposure draft provides for a single set of 13 principles applying to all entities to replace the Information Privacy Principles which currently apply to agencies and the National Privacy Principles which currently apply to organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While most submitters support the reforms, the committee received a range of views on whether or not the APPs meet the objectives underpinning the need for reform and provide greater privacy protection. The committee acknowledges that drafting a single set of principles was a particularly complex task. However, the committee was concerned that many submitters argued that the new principles are complex, dense and difficult to understand. The committee considers that this is a significant issue. Without clarity, agencies and organisations may find it difficult to comply with their privacy obligations and individuals may not understand how their privacy is protected. As a consequence, the committee has made recommendations to simplify the structure of the APPs and to improve their clarity. Some submitters were also concerned that the reforms may lead to a diminution of privacy protection in some instances. While the committee has made recommendations to reconsider some aspects of the principles, on balance the committee considers that privacy protections have not been weakened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee welcomes the enhance­ment of the privacy regime through the new principles for open and transparent manage­ment of personal information and cross-border disclosure, specific regulation of the use of personal information for direct marketing activities, and restrictions on the use of government-issued identifiers. Evidence provided to the committee addressed the compliance burden on entities arising from the new principles, particularly in relation to complaint handling and obligations arising when personal informa­tion is transferred to overseas recipients. The committee acknowledges that the reforms may result in an increased compliance burden for some entities. However, the committee is of the view that the benefits of the additional requirements outweigh the compliance costs. In addition, the committee notes that many principles include a reasonableness test for the matters or steps to be undertaken, and in some principles the test also provides that no steps need to be taken if it is reasonable in the circumstances. The committee considers that these pro­visions provide entities with sufficient flexibility in complying with the privacy regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the committee considers that the Privacy Principles contained in the exposure draft reflect the intent of the ALRC's recommendations. They also will ensure that the standards are in place to address the risk of harm from the inappropriate collection, use and disclosure of personal information and to meet the expectations of individuals that personal information will be handled appropriately. The committee is currently examining the credit reporting exposure draft. The committee will then examine the final two parts of this stage of privacy reform, the health privacy and the powers and functions of the Australian Information Commissioner, when these exposure drafts are available. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="GX5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator TROETH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Thirty-four years ago, in 1977, I decided to join the Liberal Party. I did so because of the party's strong commitment to free enterprise, the family, individual liberty and community responsibility. As a mother of five children, at the time aged between 10 and one, living and working on a rural property outside Heywood in western Victoria, these were important values. I knew also that the Liberal Party, with its proud traditions of repre­senting rural electorates throughout Australia and providing equal representation for women at every level of the party organisa­tion, would be a welcoming place for a person with my background and interests. I was also a great admirer of my local member in the electorate of Wannon the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, who was at the time Australia's Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not have imagined that the Liberal Party would provide me with the opportunity to rise rapidly through its organisational ranks, reaching the posts of state vice-president and chairman of the State Strategy Committee, and then represent Victoria as a Liberal senator for 18 years, along with my distinguished colleague Senator Minchin and also with Senator Ferguson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I consider myself to be a liberal in all senses of that word: a so-called capital-L Liberal, who has been a proud and committed member of the party for more than three decades, and also what is often described as a small-l liberal—a person who believes strongly in individual freedom and the importance of tolerance, decency and integrity as cornerstone values of our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the Liberal parliamentary party, unlike those in some other parties, have always had the right to differ from other members of the party on matters of principle and conscience. This important individual freedom has been enshrined in the Liberal Party and its non-Labor predecessors since the days of Alfred Deakin, Robert Menzies and other great prime ministers. I am delighted to recognise today Mr Russell Broadbent and Mrs Judi Moylan, who I know also believe strongly in that tradition, and I am delighted to see the Hon. Warren Truss, my former senior minister in the portfolio of Agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made full use of the opportunity provided to me as a federal parliamentarian and senator to take a stand on certain human rights issues and to help ensure that Aust­ralia's treatment of refugees has been respon­sible, compassionate and in accord­ance with the rule of law and our international obligations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an earlier era it was a Liberal-National coalition government which was responsible for Australia's generous and compassionate accommodation of Vietnamese refugees arriving in Australia, just as the Menzies government had done for refugees escaping the devastation of Europe in the 1950s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, unfortunately, it seems that every possible barrier is put in the way of asylum seekers and refugees who come to Australia seeking protection from persecution. They also seek the fulfilment of their fundamental human rights and ultimately a better quality of life in a free and democratic society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Liberal senator I have on occasions exercised my right to vote on matters of con­science and principle about which I feel strongly. The right of Liberal MPs must never be taken lightly or abused, but it is a right which must remain firmly entrenched and protected within the party. Australians expect discipline from their parliamentar­ians—disunity is death—but they also want their elected representatives to stand up and be counted when they believe it is right to do so. I consider that I have fulfilled that expectation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty-four years after becoming a member of the Liberal Party, I know that my decision to join was right. Everything I have experienced during my long and rewarding political career has reinforced my belief that it is only the Liberal Party, with its com­mitment to the values I have mentioned, that pursues policies which meet the needs of every Australian from every background and with every aspiration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, my 18 years here have convinced me that Australia is very fortunate to have the hard-working and dedicated members of this parliament who, regardless of their political party or persuasion, are committed to represent their constituencies in the most effective way possible. It is of deep concern that it remains fashionable to deride politics and to deride politicians and for the coverage of political trivia to frequently interest the media more than matters of substance and real importance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly fortunate that my time in the Senate has provided me with the opportunity to pursue and further develop my interest in regional and rural affairs, the status of women, and education and training. In 1997 Prime Minister John Howard appointed me as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industry and Resources, and then in 1998 and again in 2001 as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I was the first woman appointed to executive office in this portfolio and, apart from a brief stint by Sir William McMahon in the 1950s, the first Liberal appointed to this role, which has traditionally been a National Party appointment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working with ministers John Anderson, Mark Vaile and particularly Warren Truss during my seven years as parliamentary secretary was a particularly rewarding and enjoyable part of my parliamentary career as we sought to position Australia at the front of global agricultural development. Australia may no longer ride on the sheep's back, but our wool, grain and horticulture are highly priced and valuable—highly prized, I should say; I wish it was always going to be high prices! They are highly prized and valuable exports and among the best in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After living on a farm in south-west Victoria for many years before becoming a senator, I needed no introduction to agri­culture. And during my many trips to rural Australia I came to appreciate even more our farmers' traditional qualities of resilience and true grit and, more importantly, their willingness to adapt to new technologies and to perform to world's best practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, I was privileged to work with outstanding secretaries of the department in Mr Ken Matthews and Mr Mike Taylor, both of whom have now retired from the Com­monwealth Public Service, and in the deputy secretary's position with Mr Don Banfield and Mr Cliff Samson and with many senior officers of the department, who were out­standing in their application and dedication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My particular portfolio responsibilities included rural women, horticulture and especially research and development. Up until the late 1990s the governance of the research and development corporations in the horticultural sector was strictly regulated by act of parliament, with the sector divided into two arms: research and development, and marketing. Our aim was to bring these two complementary but separate arms together to form one corporation which was better able to meet the needs of the sector. There are a diverse group of small and large industries in horticulture and there are many and varied products. Each industry naturally wanted to make sure that their interests would always be part of the new plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The merger took more than two years to achieve, with daily painstaking attention to detail, but the results have been very worth while. Horticulture Australia Ltd, the new body, is now an industry owned corporation with an annual budget of $101.4 million. Research and development accounts for $71.9 million, with the Australian govern­ment matching funds, and marketing absorbs $14.8 million. I sincerely hope that there will be no cutback in Australian government re­search and development contributions as this part of the industry continually requires new research and development projects to ensure continued excellence in Australian horticulture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One aspect of the Senate I have most enjoyed is the work of committees. My first experience of this was a complete baptism of fire. I have to say after Senator Forshaw's remarks yesterday about the Scrutiny of Bills Committee that my experience was a total contrast to his. Given I was not a lawyer and I was a new senator, my learning curve was very steep. But, through hard work and helpful coaching by the then secretary of the committee, I did not commit any glaring errors and learnt a lot along the way. I commend the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to any senator who wants to know more about some of the ways in which legislation can be scrutinised. I was reappointed to that committee after the 2007 election and I have thoroughly enjoyed my work on it. I have also been Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee and Chair of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senate committee work is extremely important for the functioning of the parliament as it enables this chamber to scrutinise legislation in detail. Nowhere was this more important than in the run-up to the 2007 election as the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legis­lation Committee scrutinised the govern­ment's Work Choices legislation, a journey I am sure Senator Marshall will never forget. Those laws were groundbreaking in the formation of industrial relations as we now know it and very necessary for productivity gains in the workplace. They were also extremely controversial. As a former teacher, the education and research elements of the committee's work were also of particular interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also been a member and more recently deputy chair of the oldest committee in the parliament: the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, which scrutinises all government expenditure on public works over $15 million. This is a joint committee. We have undertaken committee tours of inspection in almost every state. We have achieved some notable successes, including the redevelopment of the Maribyrnong detention centre in Victoria in 2005-06, and the insistence by successive chairs of the committee that departments brief us thoroughly so we can fulfil our brief of scrutiny of public works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Committee work has also provided a valuable opportunity to get to know other senators and members outside the confines of the chamber, where our behaviour and words can sometimes lead to a less than flattering assessment of our character. I thank all senators for their work on these committees. I particularly thank all Senate committee secretaries and staff for their heroic efforts in maintaining functional and effective committees at all times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in the best country in the world and, difficult though our personal circumstances may be at times, nothing in Australia, except for some Indigenous living conditions, can compare with the low education rates, the high incidence of maternal and child mortality and exclusion from economic gains suffered by many of our near neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. For this reason I became a member of the cross-party Parliamentary Group on Population and Development and worked with senators and members from other parties to persuade ministers to affect such changes as the AusAID extension of family planning guidelines in the Pacific countries to our north-east and also to provide additional support to hardworking aid agencies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also very pleased to join the cross-party group of Senator Nash, Senator Moore and former Democrat senator Lyn Allison who together brought about change in 2006 with the transfer of approval for the abortion drug RU486 from the minister for health to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. I have also worked with Senator Ludlam on bringing in a private member's bill about the independent reviewer of terrorism laws, which I sincerely hope helped prod the government to take some action on this. I see they have appointed such an officer recently. The opportunity for cross-party initiatives will always be limited, but the fact that the RU486 legislation took place as a private member's bill sponsored by four senators from different parties will I hope inspire other senators to undertake similar initiatives in the future. Political philosophies may divide us but surely the opportunity to bring about real change in important policy areas will unite us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural women are the backbone of our rural and regional communities. Thirty-two per cent of women working on farms describe themselves as farm managers and yet some 10 to 12 years ago these women rarely featured in public identifications, such as agriculture advertisements, and very few were members of national or regional boards or involved in commodity boards. During the 1990s the ABC started the Rural Woman of the Year program, which brought state winners to Canberra and the National Woman of the Year was chosen and awarded a prize. Given that rural women were part of our agricultural portfolio I did think that this good program could be made much better. I decided that if rural women were to make their way in the world, and I include in those numbers women living in regional and rural communities, in large and small towns, we needed to revamp this competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was successful in gaining sponsorship from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Women's Weekly</span>, and I will never forget the support provided by Deborah Thomas, the then editor. I was quaking as I walked into her office in Sydney to ask for program support and she could not have been nicer or more forthcoming and has stood by it ever since. That sponsorship has continued to this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the program that I set up not only did we have the state winners but I persuaded each of the research and development corporations to choose a woman that they felt represented their industry very well, and these women together with the state winners came to Canberra. All of those women from both programs undertook an Australian Institute of Company Directors course and had to pass an exam. Each of them had received a bursary for use in their industry. They would have the cash prize from the bursary and a qualification from the AICD and then would be mentored through their industry for the next 12 months. That has been running for 10 years now and a number of these talented women have served on research and development boards, and some are running their own businesses. I would like to think that that training has assisted them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would particularly like to thank the former heads of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation: Dr Simon Hearn, Dr Peter O'Brien, the present director, Mr Craig Burns, and particularly Edwina Clowes from RIRDC. They have all been instrumental in seeing that the program continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There should also of course be much stronger representation of women in parliament. Numerically, we are half the population and yet we still struggle to have women comprise more than 30 per cent of our federal members of parliament. Women may be put off politics as a career by the daily hostilities in question time, but I do ask those who are considering it to have a go. I did, and I regard the last 18 years as some of the most exhilarating, rewarding and exciting times of my life. We need more identification and mentoring of interested women. I have spoken in the past about a quota system, and I still believe the Liberal Party needs some sort of jump-start to achieve a critical mass of women parlia­mentarians. Women need not be in parliament to represent women's views, but the composition of the parliament should reflect the numbers in society, and at present it does not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to have been a senator for Victoria. In my view, Victoria leads the rest of Australia in its liveability, its diversity of manufacturing and industry and its culture. I am delighted with the election of the Baillieu government in Victoria. I am heartened that the government has begun in earnest to deliver on and implement all of its policy commitments given at the election, and I am confident of a prosperous and progressive future for Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been very fortunate with the staff members who have worked for me. From the early days in Broadmeadows at the railway station to the melting pot of St Kilda and then on to the CBD, everyone has contributed to make our office a happy and efficient workplace. To my staff who are with me here today—both past and present—I extend thanks and good wishes. They are Sue, Meri, Mary and Paolo, and I would also like to note the presence of Jennifer, who is Russell Broadbent's staff member and who has always been a particular help to me. Thank you, Jennifer. To my great friend Mr Ian Robertson I owe a great deal for his constant wise counsel and sensible advice. To the staff of the Senate—and I think I can see some of the members of the Public Works Committee sitting up there, thank you very much—other parliamentary staff, and all the Comcar drivers, many thanks for having made my task easier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to my family, none of whom could be here today because of family commitments, but I assure them we will have gala celebrations in Melbourne as I finish my Senate term. Thank you to you all: my children, their partners and my grandchildren for tolerating a sometimes obsessed mother, mother-in-law, and grandmother, but the opportunity to be in government for 11½ years and to be in a national parliament has been one of the most satisfying achievements of my life. And so my work in the Senate comes to an end, but not, I hope, my dedication to the causes about which I have spoken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00auf" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARNETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  It has been a privilege serving as a senator for Tasmania since February 2002. Despite the ups and downs of political life I have loved serving and advocating for Tasmania, the Liberal cause and the values that I believe in. I have particularly enjoyed speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves, always striving to make a difference with a can-do attitude—not always successful but always striving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a dream as a child to serve in federal parliament and that dream came true. I have lived the dream and I am thankful. I joined the Liberal Party in 1980, 31 years ago. I was underage and in my first year at the University of Tasmania law school. I am a long-term Liberal. I believe in the merits of smaller government, lower taxes and greater individual freedoms. I believe in the centrality of family, the inherent qualities of each individual, the ladder of opportunity and choice. I believe in the basic freedoms of our parliamentary democracy, freedom of thought, worship, speech and association. I believe in a fair go and a safety net for those who need it. I have appreciated providing a voice for small business—the backbone of our economy—and promoting the spirit of enterprise that is so important to our prosperity as a nation. For more than half of my time in this place I was part of a coalition government under the stewardship of John Howard and Peter Costello that delivered economic sunshine, paid off Labor's debt and left this country on a sound financial footing. I am proud to have served as part of that government and to have later contributed to the task of holding the Labor government to account in opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I reflect upon the last 9½ years, there have been some highlights, special memories, sad moments and lessons learned. I will now share some of those. Most colleagues in this place and in my community know of my passion for a healthier, more active Australia. I have held 10 healthy lifestyle forums to help combat childhood obesity and to address other important health issues. I played a key role in the establishment of the Active After-Schools Communities program, imple­menting two hours of PE in schools per week, in fast food and tuckshop reforms and in making obesity a national health priority. I produced and edited the book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Millennium Disease</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Responses To Australia's Obesity Epidemic</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I established, very importantly, the Tasmanian Pollie Pedal, modelled on the national Pollie Pedal, which was initiated by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, some 14 years ago. Cyclists in Tony's nine to 10 day Pollie Pedal go further and faster than those in the Tasmanian three-day version. In Tasmania we spend more time taking in beautiful scenery, the wineries, cheese and chocolate factories, and each year we raise funds for people who have diabetes in Tasmania. Some say we end up heavier at the end of it than at the beginning. I do acknowledge the Leader of the Opposition in the chamber today and thank him for his presence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obesity already costs this nation an estimated $58 billion per annum and chronic disease, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer, makes up 80 per cent of all health costs in Australia. But you ain't seen nothing yet. The obesity tsunami and its consequences are coming and we must prepare for it now with more healthy active lifestyles, particularly for our children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been privileged to be a founding and executive member of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. I particularly want to recognise the chair of that group in the chamber today, the Hon. Judi Moylan, for her outstanding leadership and also all the executive and other members of this bipartisan group which does such important work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group held a dinner in my honour with over 70 people and at which my good friend and obesity diabetes guru Professor Paul Zimmet was guest speaker. At that dinner, Lewis Kaplan, CEO of Diabetes Australia, who is in the chamber today, announced my appointment as the inaugural Diabetes Australia ambassador. This is indeed a great honour. My thanks to Diabetes Australia for the opportunity to be an advocate while following a passion that I love. The CEO of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Mike Wilson, also gave me 'the boot'. The boot is an award bestowed on only 10 Australians in the last 20 years for services to Australians living with type 1 or juvenile diabetes. I cherish this honour and here it is. It is not always enjoyable to get 'the boot', but last night it was!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, I was recently appointed as a delegate for the western Pacific to the International Diabetes Federation. Indeed, that is a great honour. I note the United Nations Summit on Non-Communicable Diseases in New York in September this year—an important conference where we need high-level representation. I look forward to working with others to make a difference in the diabetes community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the only member in the parliament with type 1 diabetes, I am particularly pleased to take up these appointments. Thank you to the senators in this place for your patience when I have needed to do a blood sugar check or to grab a few jellybeans for a sugar hit. I have over 2,000 finger pricks per year and have had more than 30,000 finger pricks since I was diagnosed on my wife's birthday on 15 January 1997. These daily finger pricks are an important feature in the lives of the 140,000 Australians with type 1 diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a reminder of healthy, active lifestyles, I will be giving every federal member of parliament in the next few days a pedometer. Parliament has 22 kilometres of corridor, so I hope they are well used. Beyond the walls of parliament, I also believe there is great merit in all MPs and senators being actively involved in some form of sport or recreation both for their own sake and as an example to our community. MPs know I am enthusiastic particularly about tennis, swimming, cycling and squash, but I commend all MPs to have a go, no matter at what level, and I acknow­ledge the great work and encouragement of Andy Turnbull of the Australian Parliamentary Sports Association in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time in the Senate I have also sought to be a voice for volunteers, who remain undervalued and underrecognised in our community. They are Australia's unsung heroes. My first major submission as a senator in 2002 was to the then Prime Minister John Howard on how we can help our volunteers. Working with emergency services and other volunteers during the Beaconsfield mine disaster in 2006 and the Tasmanian east coast bushfires are memories that I will never forget. The annual Thank You to our Volunteers event that I have hosted since 2008 with Volunteering Tasmania and with the support of sponsors like Tasmanian Independent Retailers has been well appreciated. Volunteers deserve support and we can all do more to provide support and encouragement to our volun­teers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fighting for and defending family values has always been important to me, as I know it is for many in this place. Helping secure funding for the National Schools Chaplaincy program was a highlight, as was gaining Mr Howard's support for defining marriage as between a man and a woman in legislation in 2004 with bipartisan support. They stand out as highlights, as do receiving the William Wilberforce Award in 2007 and the Australian Christian Values Institute Award just this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marriage is a bedrock institution. It provides an umbrella under which children can grow and be nurtured and loved. In my view, homosexual marriage will deny children any opportunity to know and be loved by both a mother and a father. The debate to date has been too adult centred and, in my view, that is disappointing. If the community hold these same values they need to express them publicly and passionately to their local political representatives as a priority before it is too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an honour to work with veterans. It is vital we pay honour and respect to those in our Defence Force both past and present who serve so that we can all enjoy the freedoms that we have today. I also briefly comment on the ongoing challenge of terrorism, of which we must be vigilant. That fateful day on September 11, 2001 changed the world. Australia has a vital role to play in international efforts to fight terrorism both in its traditional forms and in the ever more relevant area of cybercrime and cyber­terrorism. I walked the Kokoda Track in 2008 with Bruce Scott, the Scottsdale RSL President who is in the gallery today, together with Marco Fragiacomo and 15 others. We raised over $150,000 for the juvenile diabetes research—a great effort. Our other objective was to honour the veterans. We did that. On my return I reignited the effort, with others and with the support of the RSL, to officially recognise the service of the PNG nationals, affec­tionately known as 'fuzzy wuzzy angels'. The Rudd government did this and I thank them for it. I acknowledge the PNG High Commissioner in the gallery today, who I know is delighted with this outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I visited Hell Fire Pass and the Thai-Burma railway with four former POWs and Senator John Williams—a special event. My great uncle served as a POW for 3½ years under the Japanese. I have been privileged to visit Gallipoli, the Western Front battlefields in France, the Changi war cemetery in Singapore and the war cemeteries in Jerusalem and Beersheba, Israel. In 2010 the planned national tour of a display regarding Australia's Gallipoli VC winners did not include Tasmania—yes, Tasmania was left off the map! I was pleased to then lead what was a classic grassroots campaign with a petition launch, support from the RSL and a successful Senate motion. In the end, more than 20,000 Tasmanians visited the exhibition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the support of the Tasmanian RSL I authored the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Our Heroes: Tasmania's Victoria Cross Recipients</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> The third edition was recently launched at Australia's oldest RSL in Launceston. Among those recognised in that book is Lieutenant Colonel Harry Murray VC, Australia's most highly decorated soldier whose medals and personal effects are on display in Tasmania right now for the first time ever available to the public. It was my privilege to play a key role in bringing this display to Harry Murray's home state and to see that he was honoured with a life-sized statue in his home town of Evandale in 2006. Harry Murray VC should receive further recognition, including the posthumous awarding of the Distinguished Service Medal from the United States and a memorial in Guedecourt, France, where he earned his VC in February 1917. I have written letters requesting this recognition with the support of the Tasmanian RSL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current government is now inquiring into the possible awarding of Victoria Crosses to those who may have been, for one reason or another, overlooked in earlier years. Prior to this, there were efforts for Tasmanian Ordinary Seaman Teddy Sheean to be posthumously recognised with a VC, and it has been a pleasure for me to have worked with Garry Ivory, nephew of Teddy Sheean, and other members of the Sheean family, on this campaign since last year. There are also emerging efforts to recognise Leading Cook Francis Bassett, or 'Dick' Emms, of Launceston, whose name has been put forward in the course of this inquiry. The courage, endurance, mateship and sacrifice of our armed service men and women should never be forgotten. As the good book says, 'Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.' Lest we forget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early in my Senate career I recall the perfect political day. The day began with a visit to the Fusion community centre at Poatina in Tasmania, a place where much tremendous work is done. Fusion is an international youth and community organisation which helps socially at-risk young people and which, in particular, has over 250 staff and thousands of volunteers in this country and overseas. Then together with former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, via a CDMA phone, I officially opened the CDMA telecommunications network into the Central Highlands of Tasmania. I can see Senator Colbeck smiling. I think he knows where I am going. After a pleasant chat with locals and a small snack at the Miena hotel, I drove 20 minutes to Arthurs Lake, took off my jacket, took off my tie, pulled on my waders and pulled out the fly rod. I caught a beautiful brown trout and happily drove home to the family in Launceston with the trout for dinner. The perfect political day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However a memorable and embarrassing moment on a lighter note occurred when, as a trout fishing enthusiast, as you have all gathered, and a fly fisherman, I was invited to award a prize at a trout fishing com­petition. During the speech on a warm summer's day, I swallowed a fly. I swallowed a fly in full view of the audience and, yes, it was the revenge of the fly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 2008 until 2010 I also served as the coalition's scrutiny of government waste spokesman, first under our former leader Malcolm Turnbull and then under Tony Abbott. My role was to highlight government waste and mismanagement in the parliament and to the public, and it is fair to say the current Labor government gave me plenty to do! I helped to establish inquiries into the GroceryChoice website, the pink batts fiasco and the Building the Education Revolution. I see Senator Mason in front of me nodding desperately. Well done on all your good work, Senator Mason. I issued monthly flyers and produced annual reports cataloguing Labor's waste, inefficiency and mismanagement, and continued my longstanding practice of hosting a budget breakfast in partnership with KPMG in my home town of Launceston the morning after the federal budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This work culminated, however, in the work that I did to help establish a Parliamentary Budget Office in this country. On 24 June last year, the 'night of the long knives', as the nation was informed that it had a new Prime Minister, I introduced legislation on behalf of the coalition to establish a Parliamentary Budget Office. My initiative was initially criticised profusely by a Labor government cabinet minister. However, the government has now confirmed, in the latest budget, funding of $24.9 million over four years to implement this important initiative. At this point I would also like to acknowledge and thank Philip Clayton, my principal adviser, for his excellent work in assisting on these matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments of all persuasions focus on the short term, but this government has attempted to master the 'quick political fix'. It has not worked and today's polls attest to that. We should focus more on the long term with 10-, 20- and 50-year plans—a lesson former US President Bill Clinton shared at the World Diabetes Summit in 2008 when he said, 'I wished I had spent more time focusing on the trendlines than the headlines.' We should do more visioneering—focusing on what should be rather than what could be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The media, the fourth estate, has an important role to play as it facilitates debate and discussion within our nation. Its influence is massive. This is indeed a great responsibility. It is easy to criticise, denigrate and belittle those who have chosen the path of public service, but this is not always in the national interest. If we as a nation are to regain the capacity for real reform and to shape our destiny, the media must play their part in recognising effort worthy of praise and the merit of long-term planning, while at the same time holding public office holders to account. My wife, Kate, and I have supported the National Student Leadership Forum every year since 2002 and, in recent years, together with Senator Claire Moore, I have sponsored the forum. It opens the eyes of young people to our democracy and the role of faith and values in leadership. A key theme at those events has been that of servant leadership . But on this score there is no better role model than Jesus Christ, whose life and sacrifice were the ultimate example of servant leadership. I submit that he is indeed a model of leadership relevant to all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time I would also acknowledge my good friend Jock Cameron for his work in convening and driving the National Student Leadership Forum since its inception. Jock and his wonderful team have also played a key role in relation to the National Prayer Breakfast. I have very much enjoyed his fellowship on Monday nights, with other MPs—including Scott Morrison, who is in the chamber today; I acknowledge Scott's presence—in this parliament for the duration of my time in the Senate. Jock, thanks very much for your support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My involvement with the National Student Leadership Forum also provided me with one of the most confronting and saddest moments in my Senate career, when, together with a delegation of students, I visited Docker River, an isolated Indigenous community two to three hours south-west of Uluru. The near Third World conditions were both obvious and a shock, and brought home to me the need for us to do more as a nation to address the challenges facing Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate plays a vital role in our democracy. The checks and balances work. The scrutiny of legislation, executive government and the financial affairs of our country remain important functions. The committee system is effective, and the estimates process both illuminating and at times exhausting. In regard to these specific functions of the Senate, I have recently written to the President and others making suggestions for reform, particularly regarding sitting hours and healthy food options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years I have particularly enjoyed my role as both Chair and Deputy Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, along with Labor Senator Trish Crossin. I acknowledge some of our key reports, on donor conception, judging the judges, censorship, terrorism, marriage, euthanasia and other matters. My particular thanks go to the committee secretaries and staff for their professional and wonderful work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Senate is not doing all that it was established to do. The Senate was formed as a states' house but the party political system has largely nullified this role. We perform best when we are able to promote and defend our states and our local communities. The political straitjacket imposed by the party system impedes this approach. The rigidity imposed by the party machine is another reason for the significant growth in the parliamentary friendship groups. Many of the two-thirds of our parliament on the backbench can and do flourish in these forums, and understandably so. I have particularly enjoyed my role as co-convenor of the Parliamentary Friends of the Millennium Development Goals and as former chair and current vice-chair of the Australia-Denmark Friendship Group. The city of Kingborough is close to securing a sister city relationship with Fredensborg, Denmark, partly because of the good work of this group and my relationship with Mayor Graham Bury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise it has been an honour to participate in this place on conscience issues. More often than not I have been on the losing side, but the discussion and debate around these issues, and the process of negotiating compromise and amendments, has caused all members of parliament to dig deep and to think hard on a personal level, whether it be on stem cell research, cloning, euthanasia or abortion. In regard to the latter, I remain saddened that second trimester and late-term abortions still occur in this country, in­cluding with taxpayer or Medicare funding. All these issues reflect the values we hold as a community and they have im­portant moral and society-wide implications.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remaining close to the community is the secret to success for any democracy. A key objective for me has been to work with the community, for the community, on the right issues and for the right reasons. Helping individuals, families, business and com­munity groups be the best they can be was part of the motivation for my writing the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Make </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Difference: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Practical Guide </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">o Lobbying</span>—all royalties of which go to juvenile diabetes research.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loss of my Senate seat at the last election reflected the dismal results for the Liberals in Tasmania, despite the successful campaign for Tony Abbott and the Liberals nationally. Senators in this place may be interested to know that my replacement has views that differ greatly from my own on most issues, but she is far better looking. A 61-39 two-party preferred outcome in Tasmania is not good and has been a catalyst for Liberal Party reform. I particularly note the work done by Julian Leeser last year to review the party in Tasmania, and with others I share the hope that these reforms will be implemented. Our selection processes should certainly be more democratic, and I know Peter Reith's report and recom­mendations support this. At this point I would also like to acknowledge the members of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team, past and present, for their work to advance Tasmania's interests. I have been very proud to have served as a member of this team. Can I also commend our Tasmanian Liberal State President, Richard Chugg, for his ongoing efforts to reform the party in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has lived in the US, I think it is time to consider the merit of including a primary-style involvement of Liberal voters committed to the party as part of the selection process. In making this suggestion, the key issue is to encourage community engagement in our democracy, which, after all, means government by the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy bungles and broken promises are seemingly never ending. The civil union between Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Greens leader Senator Bob Brown will be more transparent from 1 July with the Greens holding the balance of power in the Senate. The Greens support the introduction of death duties, oppose private health insurance and support a free-range drug policy. There is opposition in their ranks to Israel. Australia has been a long and loyal friend of Israel and I hope this Senate chamber makes it clear that this relationship should grow rather than be diminished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a Tony Abbott coalition government now more than ever. I am convinced Tony Abbott will be Australia's next Prime Minister. My home state of Tasmania is in a parlous state under the Labor-Green government, which appears to be in a rolling crisis. Confidence levels are at an all-time low. Tasmanians are doing it tough with cost-of-living pressures. They deserve better. At the state level, there is hope for the future. I believe that Will Hodgman and his Liberal team can deliver more responsible management of public finances, stable government and a strong economy for the people of Tasmania.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time such as this, there are of course many people to thank. The effectiveness and professionalism of senators is dependent on many people. The Australian Senate is like a beacon that shines brightly among the parliamentary democracies of the globe. May I place on record my personal thanks to the clerks and other staff of the Senate; the staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services; the Comcar staff and drivers, who have been thoughtful and courteous at all times; the travel and security staff; and the many others who help us in our role. I make special mention of the chaplain of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship, Reverend Peter Rose, who is in the chamber today. A special thankyou goes to the staff of the Parliamentary Library for their compre­hensive and timely research service. May I acknowledge and thank those many supporters in the gallery, some of whom were here for my first speech in March 2002, as well as those in Tasmania and elsewhere around the country, for their support and encouragement. It is appreciated. I am particularly thankful for the dedicated, professional and tireless work of my office team, past and present. I would like to acknowledge all of them, including my original team. It is most appreciated. We had a special celebration last Friday night in Launceston, which was well appreciated by all. They have done a fantastic job, and together we have kicked some goals for Tasmania and our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay a special tribute to my wife, Kate, and children, Nina, Alice and Ben, who are here in the gallery today, supported by my mother Sallie, Lady Ferrall. I love you. I thank you for your patience and perseverance, your loyalty and seemingly unconditional love over the past 9½ years. By far my greatest achievement of my time in the Senate is maintaining a close and loving relationship with my wife and my family, by God's grace. This was an objective I set out in my first speech and I am immensely thankful.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, as we face the future early in the 21st century I recount the words of King George V at the beginning of the Second World War when he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year, 'Give me a light that I might tread safely into the unknown,' and he replied, 'Go into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way'.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal level, I am excited about the challenges and opportunities ahead, mixed with just a little trepidation as the plans roll out. Whatever the future holds, I know who holds the future. In July I look forward to cycling in the Tour de France. I will be participating in the final week of the three-week tour, pretending very hard to be a champion. After this adventure, apart from my role as ambassador for Diabetes Australia, I will continue to pursue my passions while remaining within striking distance of federal and state politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to the senators in this place for the tremendous amount of goodwill and camaraderie despite their many disparate views. It is a testament to the character of this chamber. May I take this opportunity to wish all retiring senators every good wish, whatever lies ahead. Thank you for your service to the Senate and the nation. Also, best wishes to continuing and new senators in this place for the challenges ahead. Since Federation there have been 534 senators who have served our nation, with 76 of them representing Tasmania. I am indeed grateful to have been one of them for the past 9½ years. I thank the people of Australia, and particularly the people of Tasmania.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e6a" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator TROOD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  Mr President, you will be aware that the members of the Senate of Canada are appointed to their positions. There are no doubt good reasons for this, but as much as I admire a great deal that is Canadian, its appointed Senate has never been something of which I entirely approve—that is, until now! Being now in a position where I am required to exit this place as a result of having lost my seat at the most recent federal election, I can suddenly see the many virtues of the Canadian way. The idea that one cannot be removed from a legislature by the electorate, and from which one is allowed to retire in a leisurely manner on reaching the estimable age of 70, is one that, with some persuasion, I believe I could embrace. But whether I like it or not, we are here in Australia and we are a democracy, and a very robust one at that. The contrarian second President of the United States, John Adams, a man whose dogged determination and vision for his new country I greatly admire, may have been somewhat over­stating the point when he remarked that with the end of elections there can be only slavery, but the sentiment is surely correct. Elections are the lifeblood of any and every stable democracy, and I of course accept the judgment of the Queensland people as they rendered that judgment last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The six years I have been here have passed extraordinary quickly and, at times, tumultuously. When I arrived, the Howard government had just been elected for a fourth term. As the sixth senator elected, and the fourth from the coalition in Queensland, I am very conscious it was the winning of my seat that gave the coalition the numbers it needed to gain a majority in the Senate—the first of any party since 1977. Contrary to common wisdom, the Howard government did not, as a matter of general practice, abuse that majority. Some landmark reforms of national significance were made in the areas of Indigenous affairs, aged care, superan­nuation, taxation and telecommunications, among much else, and Australia and Australians were all the better for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then of course there was Work Choices. We did not lose the 2007 election because of Work Choices, but it did not help. I well remember the day in 2006 when the Senate resolved to pass the enabling bill. Senators who were here may recall that it was late in the afternoon and a storm was brewing outside the building as a third reading debate was getting underway. With the public galleries of the chamber replete with protesting members of the trade union movement, Senator Brandis gave a stentorian third reading speech in which he told the bill's opponents that they were, among other things, on the wrong side of history. I think it is fair to say that this was a prescient observation in more ways than one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as the final vote was about to be taken, there was an intense flash of lightning and a very heavy, resonating clap of thunder. To this day I still believe that momentarily the lights of the chamber went off, to return perceptively duller than before. At that point, I recall turning to Senator Fifield on the bench to my left—a rather unusual position for Senator Fifield since on most other occasions he is almost always to my right—and I remarked: 'This could be a sign. Perhaps we should rethink this bill?' We did not, of course. The bill was passed and the rest, as they say, is history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, the coalition overreached parts of Work Choices, but only parts of it. In doing so, it fell into one of the great age-old traps of success: the tendency towards hubris. Perhaps not surprisingly, it suffered the unravelling of reputation that ineluctably followed from it. To the extent that Work Choices struck down some of the long established fundamental industrial rights of Australians, it went too far. But many of its reforms were innovatory and entirely appropriate for a modern 21st-century economy. The Rudd-Gillard government has now reversed many of these changes and in doing so taken Australia's system of industrial relations back to the era of pre Hawke-Keating government reforms. Not only has much of this been bad for the Australian economy but it has disempowered Australian workers, killed competition and undercut the foundations of small business. A policy correction is required so that a constituency in need of a voice can be heard. So at some point I anticipate the coalition will have to revisit its reluctance to engage with this area of public policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Work Choices aside, I am very proud that, as a very active member of several Senate committees, I was able to make useful contributions to improving some of the legislation that came before us. In my view, the committee system is unquestionably one of the great strengths of the Senate. Indeed, one of my first letters to an editor of any kind was penned as a rather callow youth and in praise of Senate committees. The committees are not places where politics is left aside and nor should they be. They are often, however, places where reason, judgment and compromise can triumph over prejudice in the search for solutions to national problems. I trust this will continue to be their role and, when accommodation is not possible, I hope that we will all at least be left with civility of difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee I was a party to strengthening the civil liberties protections in some of the anti-terror legislation, which was, I believe, a valuable role. On some issues, such as immigration, I was grateful to have been fortified by the courage of some of my Liberal colleagues. They provided me with the strength of purpose to assist in seeking humane and sensible reforms to our government's sometimes austere refugee policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To have served as the chair and deputy chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee is for me an enormous honour. I am convinced the work the committee did on military justice under the leadership of Senator Payne will be recognised as being of profound importance in helping the Australian Defence Force to address a deeply troubling aspect of its culture, one that serves neither its members nor the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am especially proud of the committee's inquiries into peacekeeping, public diplomacy and the Torres Strait region—the last two of which I was fortunate to lead. As the continuing public debate over these matters testifies, they focus on issues of long-term significance to the nation and serve as a welcome reminder that the work we do on committees in this place is amongst the most valuable we undertake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in relation to committee work, I take the opportunity to highlight my time as the chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Reform of the Australian Federation. I anticipate that the committee's report will be tabled by the end of this month. It will, I hope, draw renewed attention to an aspect of Australian public policy that has been woefully neglected—namely, federal-state relations. Australia's system of government was conceived as a federation. That, indeed, was the form of governance that my own great-grandfather helped to create during the federation movement at the end of the 19th century. But over 100 years the federal compact between the states and the federal government has been severely eroded. Centralising governments in Canberra, with complicity of the High Court, have recast the constitutional distribution of powers which was once carefully balanced. Financial distortions have not only impoverished state and territory treasuries, they have grievously undermined the states' political authority, making responsible government increasingly remote from every Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The parties of the coalition cannot absolve themselves of responsibility for this parlous state of affairs. The drift of political power and fiscal responsibility to Canberra has been visible on our watch as with Labor, yet we are supposedly the party of federation. Neither Deakin nor Menzies, however, would now recognise it in this way. Regrettably, in recent years my party has had few serious considered thoughts on restoring the health of the federation. As the natural custodians of the federal ideal, we should feel more than a little guilty at this neglect. But, more than this, we should be urgently committed to responding to the challenge it poses. The Liberal Party needs to rediscover its federalist values and develop the program of reform which will restore them to their principal place in our system of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Away from the parliamentary domain, I have tried to be always conscious of my responsibilities to pay close attention to the needs of my constituents—the people of the great state of Queensland. Engaging actively, often and, hopefully, effectively with the men and women of the rural and regional parts of the state has been enormously satisfying. As a former educator, my involvement with schools, colleges and universities has also been an important facet of my work. In part this has been a dimension of a personal quest to try and expand public knowledge and understanding about our parliament and more particularly the role of the Senate in our system of government. More than this, education offers Australians the promise of a secure and prosperous future. We do not fill that promise by wasting millions of dollars on ill-conceived education revolutions. We need to invest in knowledge, innovation, languages and best teaching practice. When we think we have done enough, there will always be more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been rewarding to assist community groups to take up ignored causes and issues such as international adoption; to assist constituency and personal distress; and to help promote environmentally sound ideas, such as opposition to the entirely ill-conceived Traveston Crossing dam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fair to say that when I took office I had little comprehension of how varied and, indeed, busy a senator's life could be, but the richness of my work among the people of Queensland has proved one of the most rewarding parts of my term. In my first speech I spent some time decanting my views on international relations and, more especially, the challenges to Australian foreign and defence policy. I urged the Senate's attention to several matters, not least the need to engage more fully with East Asia and the demands posed by a rising China. I return to these and other foreign policy themes with a mix of reassurance and pessimism. On the reassuring side, I am delighted that the Rudd government saw fit to adopt, at least partially, several of the policy proposals outlined in my 2008 Lowy monograph on the emerging global order. In my view the comprehensive national security strategy, of which we have so far seen only a glimpse, is still a worthwhile objective. I welcome the establishment of the Office of the National Security Adviser, although I am anxious that it should not overreach what should be its limited responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On defence more directly, I wait with high anticipation for the moment when we are all able to face up to the reality that the capability program in the 2009 Defence White Paper is well beyond the nation's ability to achieve. Only when we face up to this manifestly obvious point will we begin to have a credible defence posture for the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all its many detractors, the Howard government left office in November 2007 with a distinguished record of achievement in East Asia. By contrast, the policies of the Rudd and Gillard governments have been far less assured, being often poorly formulated and ineptly implemented. In 3½ years the steady trajectory of a deepening engagement with Asia has faltered as our relationships with China, Japan, India, Fiji, Papua and New Guinea, Indonesia and others have all been shaken by problems. We might reasonably hope that eventually these relationships will be put back on track. But as I said in my first speech, engagement with Asia–or indeed the Pacific–cannot be a part-time affair. Nor can we be indifferent to the changes taking place in the wider Indo-Pacific region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our neighbourhood, and just coincidentally it has become the central dynamic arena of the 21st century global strategic order. We dare to ignore that reality at our political and economic peril. And yet, as Australians, we seem so little interested. As Michael Wesley has said in his new book, <span style="font-style:italic;">There Goes the Neighbourhood</span>, we remain complacent, incurious and unprepared to think about how the world is changing, how this might affect us and what we will need to do to prosper and to remain secure in the new era. This is a national delinquency of the highest order, and requires urgent attention if we are to have any hope of surviving the international challenges ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are struggling to pay serious attention to our region of primary strategic importance, it is perhaps fanciful to encourage a focus on horizons even further afield. If for no other reason, however, than that the Indian Ocean rim is of fast growing importance to our national interest we should begin to look anew at Africa. I acknowledge that this has been, and is, a policy priority of the recent Labor governments. To my colleagues in the coalition: I urge that we no longer continue to look at Africa through the prism of Labor's goal to secure a non-permanent seat on the Security Council and its aid policy there. In my view, the Security Council is in the national interest, and should be embraced for a multitude of reasons. But I emphasise: not at any cost, and I fear that this is where we are heading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that to one side, Australia's interests in Africa should be judged on their merits. They are neither wide nor deep at this point in time, but they are growing. Africa itself is changing rapidly in ways that will mean it is a place of mounting significance in global affairs. We can ignore this if we wish; alternatively, a relatively modest strategic investment now in Africa's political, econ­omic and educational future is likely to pay considerable dividends into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I cannot leave the topic of foreign affairs without mentioning the long-ignored need to better resource the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Recent evidence to the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and in Senate estimates, has once again underscored the parlous state of DFAT's finances. The failure to confront this issue is not just a neglect of this government: my party must accept some of the responsibility. But the situation has deteriorated over the last few years because of Labor's very ambitious foreign policy, which has been underfunded. Diplomatic, representational, consular, public diplomacy, policy analysis and long-term policy planning within the portfolio are all under intense pressure. In a globalised world Australia's diplomatic footprint is both narrow and shallow in key regions of importance to our security and prosperity, and is far less than comparable countries. This is no longer sustainable as it is undercutting the protection and advancement of Australia's national interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer is not just to find the resources to reflate the DFAT budget. The way Australia is represented abroad will have to change and DFAT's habits of doing business at home will need reform. That said, the department needs more resources and the simplest, least painful way to secure them is to look at AusAID The planned growth in its rapidly expanding budget over the next few years responds to our generous instincts. But in the context of DFAT's plight, it is ill-advised. It should be slowed and the savings directed to DFAT as a matter of high priority.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing I take the opportunity to thank the servants of the Senate, the former Clerk, Harry Evans, current Clerk, Rosemary Laing, and their dedicated staff. I also extend my gratitude to the staff of the committees, most especially, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and its distinguished secretary, Dr Dermody, who have helped to make my work so fulfilling. My staff have been wonderful. Without the thoroughly professional and dedicated service of Fraser Stephen, Honor Lawler, Lynn Mitchell, Kate Grayson, Marty Kennedy and Julie Crouch, I would have accomplished very little.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been fortunate in being able to develop some lasting friendships among my colleagues on this side of the chamber, and I trust that they will continue. And among my colleagues on the other side of the aisle I have found, rather unexpectedly I have to say, a degree of much appreciated collegiality. In the interest of not blighting any careers anywhere in the chamber, I will mention no names!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the absence of the love, understanding and support I have received from my wife, Dale, and our family, my life here would have been simply impossible. I am very conscious that, as I took my seat in this chamber just six years ago, I was exceptionally fortunate to have been given an opportunity to sit as a senator in our nation's federal parliament. Many years ago, I had a dream that one day this might be possible. Over six years, that dream has come true. I thank my party for giving me the chance to stand for office. It has been an absolute honour and an enormous privilege to serve the people of Queensland, and I thank them most sincerely. I thank the Senate.</span>

                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate for this courtesy. Tonight the coalition salutes the service of three outstanding colleagues. All senators have made substantial personal sacrifices to serve their communities and nation—more so, their families. We, the senators get involved in the issues of the day. We are passionate. We are committed. The family and those around us are often the conscripts. To the conscripts I say: thanks for lending us your senator. We in the coalition have no doubt that you will recognise the full contributions they have been able to make as being as worthwhile as we do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to Senator Troeth. When I first joined this place my office was next to that of a senator of whom I had not previously heard. I assume Senator Troeth had not previously heard of me either. Nevertheless, she was the first senator into my office and schooled me and acclimatised me to the Senate, for which I am grateful. Those first few weeks, in helping me to orient me, she was most gracious and kind, and it was very beneficial to me. At the time, I was struck by Senator Troeth's personable-yet-no-nonsense style—traits that made her the effective senator we have come to respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her 18 years of service will be remembered for many things, including her passion for the rural community and her very distinguished service as a parliamentary secretary in the agriculture portfolio. Her knowledge and detailed understanding of the levies for various horticultural sectors was phenomenal, her advocacy and capacity beyond question. Her commitment to innovation was greatly valued by the sectors. And, of course, those qualities are what gained her her endorsement in the first place some 18 years ago—an endorsement which was solely based on merit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In entering the Senate she immediately spoke of the importance of the Senate, rejecting the unfortunate references to this place by the then Prime Minister. She spoke of her passion for the rural sector. She spoke of her commitment to serving the people of Broadmeadows, willingly going out to Labor heartland to serve the people whom Labor had disenfranchised. She spoke of government intervention in the rural economy doing more harm than good and then quoted a certain person in support of that view. That certain person happens to have been one Ross Garnaut, who has now re-emerged in the political spectrum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth is a principled person. She lived by her first speech when she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we must never lose sight of the fact that political morality means more than just winning, political compassion means more than just clever speeches and ministerial responsibility means more than membership of the right faction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth has lived by those principles. She crossed the floor and she spoke out, but she has done so with dignity and courage. I trust that when I crossed the floor I did it with half the poise, decency and principle with which Senator Troeth did. Once the issue was over, it was over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth, whilst being independently minded, was nevertheless a team player and a solid contributor to the fight. In her first speech Senator Troeth quoted GK Chesterton:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the end, it will not matter to us whether we fought with flails or with reeds. It will matter to us greatly on what side we fought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I know on what side I am fighting, and there is a great deal for which to fight— </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth told the Senate. There is no doubt that Senator Troeth knew which side she was on, and fight she did. And, unlike her beloved Hawks last Saturday night—sorry; I could not not mention that, being a Geelong supporter—she usually did win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth leaves of her own volition and can be well satisfied that she did herself, the Liberal Party, her state of Victoria and the people of Australia proud. Senator Troeth, to refer to the last bit of your valedictory speech, you have succeeded. On behalf of the coalition, we all wish you very well for the future. I turn to my Tasmanian colleague Senator Guy Barnett. Politics is a rollercoaster ride and people make their judgments on us as individuals and, in this place, more importantly on our parties on a particular day. There is no doubt that if that particular day were today Senator Barnett would have been re-elected. Regrettably, it was not to be in August last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Barnett styled himself as the can-do senator in his very first speech. And that he was. It was a big call, but he lived up to it. His electorate work and his committee work were both exemplary and he showed a committed work ethic. I think Senator Ian Macdonald might just beat you on the number of speeches on government docu­ments, but you ran a very close second. But I might call it for Senator Barnett on adjournment speeches. They covered all manner of issues and, to his great credit, no issue was too small or, indeed, too big. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of some of the projects for which Senator Barnett was responsible in our home state of Tasmania: from the skate park in Queenstown to the aquatic centre in Launceston he helped develop that much-needed and lasting infrastructure which will bear testament to Senator Barnett's com­mitment to active lifestyles. He championed local causes: as he mentioned, to get the VC medals to Tasmania, digital radio, helping the locals after the east coast fires, the medical services in Ouse and Rosebery—and the list goes on. He also championed national issues: NetAlert, the definition of marriage, the volunteer sector, health issues, our cultural history and the importance of the Bible and the chaplaincy service. As Chair of the Waste Watch Committee, Senator Barnett excelled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being senators for Tasmania, we know our only strength is by hunting in a pack to get the best outcomes for our state. Senator Barnett was an integral part of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team. He will be missed by his team mates and the Tasmanian people. I am not so sure that the media will miss him. His incessant media releases, whilst always considered, got a fair share of hits and coverage. Up to the very last, Senator Barnett has been active in the party room, in the electorate, in the committees of this place and in this place itself. Given our pending reduced numbers, the coalition will have difficulty in filling all roles. Losing such a prodigious worker will make it all the more difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first speech, Senator Barnett courageously tried to pre-empt his political epitaph. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I would hope that at the conclusion of my political life the people who stand in judgment will say that Guy Barnett had a can-do attitude; he encouraged others to achieve their dreams; he was effective and a pioneer; he cared and had compassion; he had a passion for life and a vision for his state and his country; and, finally, more than his work, he loved his wife and family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Barnett, all those things about you are true, but they will not appear on an epitaph just yet. I have a funny feeling that it is a little bit too early for that and a few other bits and pieces might be added in another chapter which will be written later in your life. But epitaphs aside, all of the descriptions, which Sir Humphrey-like you courageously set yourself, you have lived up to. You can feel well satisfied that you lived up to the high benchmarks that you set yourself. But, more than self-satisfaction, the Liberal Party members and the people of Tasmania you represented share that sense of satisfaction with you, as was so overwhelmingly displayed at your testi­monial dinner on 4 June. All the best and, as you get on your bike literally for the Tour de France, take a well-deserved break and ensure that you do employ all those talents you have in the future for the betterment of our community and society. I am sure you will. On behalf of the coalition, we wish you every success for the future.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator ABETZ:</span>
                  </a>  Last but definitely not least, I turn to Senator Trood. If I might opine, like a Queensland predecessor, former senator John Herron, Senator Trood looks like you would imagine a senator should look—distinguished. Not only does he look distinguished but he has distinguished himself. His election victory in 2004 gave the coalition the fourth seat from Queensland in the Senate—an amazing result. For us on this side of politics to get a university type is a big thing these days. To get them to run and then get elected seems nearly unbelievable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no surprise, given Senator Trood's background, that he expressed in his first speech great insights into Australia's educational needs. Whilst being from the tertiary sector, he nevertheless had a broad view of educational needs generally, noting the need for enhanced technical and further education. But it was Senator Trood's expertise in foreign affairs where he most distinguished himself. Never having served on the committee, I understand it is a committee well sought after by many colleagues as a must-get committee, if one can get on to it. So I did wonder how it was that a relatively new senator was able to get onto that committee and chair it. When you realise that there are 50 pieces of work that have been authored by Dr Trood in the area of foreign affairs and that he was a member of the Australia Indonesia Institute and a whole lot of other organisations, you understand that he was the most qualified person in this parliament to be sitting on that committee. The expertise that you, Senator Trood, provided to us in that area was very beneficial not only for our side of politics but for the Australian parliament generally. Indeed, your concern about our relationship with Indonesia is very important as we currently consider the boats going backwards and forwards—or that are not or should not be going backwards and forwards—between our two countries in relation to the cattle trade and also in relation to illegal entrants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Senator Trood's expertise, style and demeanour—if I might say so, especially on one occasion as Acting Deputy President that he may recall—will be missed by us on this side. Senator Trood, we wish you well. You have a clear body of expertise that we trust will not be lost to the Australian community and that you will be able to put to good use. We wish you all the very best for the future as well.</span>

                  <a href="AX5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHRIS EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  I want to address a few remarks on behalf of the government in response to the speeches by three retiring senators. I offered Senator Abetz the courtesy of allowing him to go first because we were addressing the careers of three Liberal senators tonight, but, having seen him steal most of my material, I can say that that will not be happening again. They say great minds and fools think alike, but people make their own judgment about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do have much pleasure tonight in speaking on the farewells to the three senators. Senator Troeth and I were of the class of '93, along with Senator Minchin. It is a bit worrying; I think I might be the last of them left. No doubt my colleagues will sort that out soon. But I have always had a great deal of respect for Senator Troeth; she is well liked and well respected on our side of politics, although she is known also as steely, I think, for her grit and determination. I saw that during her time as a parliamentary secretary in the Howard government. She put in, I think, seven years of very hard graft in difficult portfolios and carried a big load in the Senate as well; she did that with great aplomb. Obviously she has committed herself to committee service as well and has a fine record in committee service in this parliament. Like Senator Abetz, I remarked on re-reading her first speech that she made a strong commitment to the issues of rural women and representing rural women and also representing and advocating for the role of women in politics. It is interesting to see that Senator Troeth is one of those who actually delivered on her first speech and pursued the issues she raised then. I thought she came full circle tonight and was still advocating the causes that she advocated in her first speech, which I think is a great credit to her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to remark on her stand on refugee issues and her crossing of the floor in pursuit of her beliefs on those issues—not to take any delight from an opposition party point of view at all but to make a broader point. I think one of the best speeches given in this parliament was her speech in 2009—not because I agreed with much of it but for its power and its principle. It was a great speech. In that speech Senator Troeth implored the Liberal Party to 'grasp a new opportunity to understand the difference between sending the wrong message to those who truly wish us harm and sending the right message to those who need our help'. It is an enduring message for us all. As I say, I think it was one of the best speeches delivered in this place for many a day. It reflected, I think, the great strength of Senator Judith Troeth, and it was to her great credit. I make the point not, as I say, to highlight the differences there might have been in the Liberal Party at the time but to highlight Senator Troeth's commitment and strength of character, and also to make the point that she will better remembered as a committed, lifelong liberal. I judge her on her career. As Senator Abetz referred to, in her first speech she famously referred to this quote by Chesterton:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I know on what side I am fighting, and there is a great deal for which to fight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this as a very positive thing. She is remembered by us as a very strong liberal, and I am sure she would like to be remembered as a very strong liberal. In quoting Waldo regarding success, I can assure her that she goes with the respect of her political opponents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Guy Barnett from Tasmania came in in 2002, and he has certainly been active and committed. I had the opportunity to travel to an Anzac Day ceremony at Gallipoli—I think in about 2005—with him and his wife, Kate, and it was a fantastic trip. Senator Bishop was on the trip as well, and I certainly recognise his interest in history and the role of our service personnel. I know he took great joy out of it, as did I. It was a tremendous experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Senator Barnett will be best remembered in this place as an example of how an individual senator can use their position—and I mean this in a positive way—to advocate and promote causes of public importance. We have huge oppor­tunities here. People use them in different ways, but Guy Barnett has certainly used his to provide a platform, through his activity as a senator, to promote awareness of diabetes and the need to do more to combat diabetes and also child obesity. I am very thrilled for him that he has been made an ambassador for Diabetes Australia; it is a great recognition of his work. For new senators thinking about how they can use the great opportunity and privilege of being a senator, his example in pursuing those causes is a good one. People use their opportunities in different ways. To Senator Guy Barnett I say: you have certainly made good use of the opportunity in promoting those causes. You have also been very active on the question of moral issues. I do not think you and I have agreed on any of them, but I do respect that your views are honestly held and you have been very active and committed on those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of your offer of the pedometer, I welcome that. I also want someone to use it for me so that I can rack up the figures, because I know last time I had one they were not all that impressive. Senator Faulkner used to quote me how many kilometres he had racked up—and I have since stopped discussing that with him. But I do look forward to it; it might be a spur for me to find more time again for exercise. We wish you all the best too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Russell Trood only had one term here. In many ways that is a shame because I think he had a lot to contribute and did not get the opportunity to continue to do so in a way that would have been good for the parliament and for the Liberal Party. I know he was famously the third Liberal senator and fourth coalition senator elected in 2004 from Queensland and that gave the Howard government their majority. I have a slightly different slant on that. I reckon it was the seed of the destruction of the Howard government, so I actually regard it in a very positive way. I thought it encouraged the Howard government to overreach—and you referred to Work Choices, which I think is the classic example. So I have a silver lining to that particular cloud at the time, Senator. I think it is a good lesson in politics, the majority that the Howard government achieved, and perhaps it is a broader lesson for us all. That is my take on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it was good for the Liberal Party and for the Senate that you were elected. I liked Senator Abetz's reference: you do actually look like a senator. You also behave much more like people's image of a traditional senator.</span>

                  </a>  He knows what I mean. Seriously, Russell Trood has brought that experience to the parliament and applied it to foreign affairs and international relations issues in this parliament to great effect. In a parliament where sometimes we are not known for our interest in ideas, Senator Trood's contribution has been notable for that. In his first speech he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ideas and education matter, not just for the prosperity they promise but because free and open societies depend on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a commendable thought in his first speech, one that he sought to give effect to in his contribution to the parliament and one that, as the current tertiary education minister, I wholeheartedly endorse. I think it is an important reflection on the value of ideas and education in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He referred to the fact that he has been quite an effective senator for raising constituent issues in this place and pursuing them persistently to good effect. I should not say this in front of the other senators but I have actually found him more effective in estimates than many of you because he has used a more reasonable and less aggressive and inquisitorial style that actually puts you under a bit more pressure than perhaps some of the more frontal assaults some of you are known for. I probably should not say that in case you take heed of what is not meant to be good advice! Certainly from the government's point of view Senator Trood is well-respected. We thought he was an interesting and valuable addition to the Senate and he has made a contribution that I think the Senate will miss. He will be a loss to the Liberal Party in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is life after politics, particularly for a well-credentialled academic with a master's degree from the University of Wales. Given the current Prime Minister and the current education minister are of Welsh descent, we regard him as a highly credentialled man, and I am sure there will be life after politics. But, seriously, Russell Trood has made a good contribution to the Senate and one that will be missed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think all three senators have records they can be proud of and have brought different contributions to the Senate. Unlike many of my colleagues, I said that before you gave your final speeches, I have said it on the occasion of your final speeches and I will say it after your final speeches as well. I think there is too much in this parliament of remembering people fondly once they have gone and not treating them with respect while they are here. Each of you have made an important contribution to the parliament, and the government acknowledges that. All the best to all three of you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  May I join with the remarks of my leader, Senator Abetz, and also take the opportunity to thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, for the generosity of his remarks. This is, of course, a very bittersweet occasion for us opposition senators because we are celebrating and, with regret, anticipating the departure on 30 June of three senators who have been very good colleagues and very good friends. We will all miss each of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, it is sad to lose two of those colleagues, Senator Guy Barnett and Senator Russell Trood, to electoral defeat. But that is, as Senator Trood pointed out, the way of democracy. Senator Judith Troeth did not suffer that fate and retires graciously. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The word 'gracious' is, I think, a word that springs readily to mind about Senator Judith Troeth because she is a gracious person in everything she does. One of the joys of my life in the Senate is to have befriended Judith Troeth, and that is a friendship I cherish very much. Early in my time in the Senate, shortly after Judith Troeth retired from the frontbench, we sat together in the middle seats at the end of the chamber. For more than two years we shared that bench and we had a very good time. I discovered that Senator Judith Troeth, among her many virtues, has a wicked sense of humour. Our friendship I think was deepened and strengthened in the many conversations we had. I regret to tell you, Madam Deputy President, that there was the occasional quiet reflection upon the shortcomings of others in the course of those many conversations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Judith Troeth is to me a person who is very close to the heart of what the Liberal Party should be and is very close to the heart of what the Liberal Party was created to be. She is a Liberal in the tradition of Menzies. She knows what it means to be a Liberal. She knows that the purpose for which our party was created was to expand the horizons of individual freedom, opportunity and choice. Everything she has ever done in this chamber in the time in which it has been my privilege to be her colleague has been dedicated to those values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Evans pointed out in his remarks, Senator Judith Troeth, although of course a very gracious person, is also a very strong person. She is one of the strongest people I know in politics. She adhered to her convictions and her principles at times when they were unpopular in the Liberal party room, especially during the Howard government. Her moral courage and strength were a beacon for all of us and in my judgment she has been an exemplar of what a courageous politician ought to be. Judith, thank you for being a friend, a great Liberal and a great parliamentarian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to Senator Guy Barnett. Guy and I have had a lot to do with each other, particularly in his role as chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Through the association on that committee and the coalition's backbench committee we have had to negotiate our way around a number of very difficult issues, issues where different members of the coalition parties had quite different perspectives across the spectrum of opinion, which we are proud to say exists within the Liberal Party. Senator Barnett has been one of the most articulate and influential exponents of a morally conservative view on a range of issues. There have been other members of that committee, including Senator Trood, to whom I will come in a moment of course, who have identified with a much more liberal approach to issues. On that committee the conflict or the difference of emphasis between the more socially and morally conservative people in my party and the more socially liberal people in my party came to the fore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I particularly appreciate about Senator Guy Barnett was he was always, especially in his role as chairman or deputy chairman, willing to see the other point of view and to accommodate the other point of view. Throughout a number of inquiries into thorny issues, including discrimination law, the bill of rights and family law, through Guy Barnett's decency, spirit of cooperation and willingness to simply be a good colleague all points of view were able to be accommodated so there was never a split in all those years between the most socially liberal and the most morally conservative coalition members on the committee. That was largely because of Senator Barnett's spirit of cooperation, decency and wisdom. It also reflects the fact that, as is so often the case in politics, many of these differences on closer scrutiny are more apparent than real. I want to thank Guy Barnett in particular for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard in his valedictory speech, there is a very impressive litany of causes he has championed and has scored significant accomplishment in bringing to public policy outcomes. Whether it be in relation to health, veterans' affairs, school chaplaincy or the Parliamentary Budget Office, Guy Barnett in the nine or so years he has been here has actually achieved measurable, specific beneficial outcomes which but for him would not have been achieved. We all aspire to do that. All three senators to whom we pay tribute today have in their own way done that, but Guy Barnett I must say across an extraordinary range of interests in public policy has certainly achieved that. I do not think anyone on either side of the chamber would gainsay it. Guy, I have enjoyed our friendship and I have enjoyed our association both professional and personal. You leave the Senate at a very young age. I am confident in saying that this may be regarded not as the end of Guy Barnett's political career but as an interruption to that career. Whether that career resumes as a further term in the Senate in years to come, or whether it takes the shape of a career in Tasmanian politics—whatever beckons—we know that Guy Barnett is someone who has given his life to pursuing the causes which his Senate career has embodied and he will continue to do that for many, many years to come. So we do not say goodbye, Guy; we say au revoir.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me now turn to Russell Trood. This is a very difficult speech for me to give because Russell and I are very close friends and we go back a very long way. We first ran into each other in the Ryan branches of the Liberal Party in Brisbane in the mid-1990s and, on every occasion I can think of, Russell was a very strong supporter of mine. In securing majorities in the Ryan branches of the Liberal Party in the early 1990s, in my preselection as a Senator in 2000 and in my election as deputy leader of my party in the Senate last year I have always had the most steadfast of supporters in Russell Trood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Abbott is fond of saying that politics is a test of character—and it is for all of us. I cannot immediately think of anyone I know who has shown such character as Russell Trood over the years. People speak of Russell's scholarship and learning and intelligence—that is all true—but the thing I most appreciate about my friend Russell Trood is his character. Let me share three anecdotes with you. When former senator Warwick Parer resigned from the Senate in February 2000, Russell and I were both interested in being the Liberal Party's candidate for that vacancy and, as friends should when there is a possibility of conflict, we had a long, long talk about it. In the end, Russell agreed to stand aside and support me—for various reasons—for which I am eternally grateful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Russell would have been entitled to feel a little disappointed that the vacancy among our mutual friends in the party was likely to be won by me, but he supported my preselection campaign not in a token or formal way, or in anyway begrudgingly, but with real enthusiasm and commitment. And I thought that that attested to tremendous character. It exemplified Edmund Burke's remark that 'in politics magnanimity is not seldom the truest wisdom'. I was determined to ensure that Russell Trood's dream of becoming a senator, of which he spoke today, would be fulfilled, and I would do everything I could to bring that to pass. So when former senator John Herron resigned from the Senate in 2002 there was another preselection, in which I very strongly supported Russell and which, sadly, he lost. It is a great shame that he lost that preselec­tion to former senator Santo Santoro; Russell was not preselected on that occasion as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2004, however, Russell was the No. 3 person on the Liberal Senate ticket, and I must say that the 2004 election campaign in Queensland for the Senate was a glorious affair. It was a ticket led by Senator Mason, with me in the middle and Russell at No. 3. We travelled countless thousands of kilometres around Queensland, with the help and support of Senator Ian Macdonald, who was not a candidate at that particular election. We spent endless days in each other's company, against the background of Senator Mason's rather idiosyncratic choice of music—and the less said about that the better—and very, very arcane conversations about the minutiae of Senate preference strategies. We spent a very enjoyable period in one another's company. Brett and I were determined that every last vote that could be found to get Russell Trood over the line was found. We did not really expect—and, Senator Joyce, I say this without any disrespect to you—that we would get four senators over the line. We thought it was probably going to be a race between Russell Trood and Barnaby Joyce for the third spot. But our efforts were rewarded with such success that both Senator Trood and Senator Joyce were elected. It was the 10th and, I am sad to say, last occasion on which the Queensland Liberal Party ran a separate Senate ticket. It was the best primary vote we ever achieved by a mile—38.3 per cent—and Russell got over the line.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second episode I want to share with the Senate which reflects on Russell's tremendous strength of character came about during the very difficult time when the parties amalgamated in Queensland and there were issues about the Senate ticket. The people who made these decisions, the people who negotiated this amalgamation, decided to observe the seniority convention and Russell was given the fourth spot. That was a very difficult spot to win; in fact, there was never a realistic prospect of winning the fourth spot in the political circumstances of the time. Arithmetically, it was effectively impossible to win four seats from a single ticket. Yet Russell dealt with that peril to his political future with extraordinary dignity and grace. It was Ernest Hemingway who said that the definition of courage is grace under pressure. You cannot put a politician under more pressure than giving him an unwinnable seat. Russell dealt with that occasion with the most extraordinary grace that it is possible to imagine and was an exemplar of Hemingway's remark. And then more recently in the difficult times of the Liberal Party at the end of 2009, when nobody's interests would have been better served by Russell Trood than for there to be a double dissolution election, which would have revived his chances of being re-elected—he probably would have been re-elected because he would have been in a winnable position on the ticket—Russell conducted himself by adopting a position based on his true beliefs, directly at variance from his own self-interest. There are very few clearer ways to test integrity in politics than to find a politician who acts directly at variance from his own self-interest in order to do something merely because he thinks it is the right thing to do. But that is the way Russell Trood conducted himself on that occasion and nobody was surprised, because that is the character of the man he is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We lose, with the departure of Russell Trood, one of the most considerable minds ever to have served in this place. Not only has he borne himself, as Senator Evans pointed out, with the dignity and bearing that everybody would imagine in a senator but also he has brought a specialist knowledge in his own chosen field of international relations rarely seen in this parliament. So we are all the poorer for his departure. It is, on an occasion like this, so sad to realise that that will be lost from us. But the friendships will continue. I just want to say, Russell, for all of those years in which you have been an exemplary colleague and a great personal friend and supporter how grateful I am to you and how much I have appreciated your friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All three of the senators who will retire on 30 June—Judith Troeth, Guy Barnett and Russell Trood—can say to themselves, 'What we set out to do when we first entered this chamber we have accomplished.' In the case of Guy Barnett and Russell Trood, there is more that they would wish to have done had they been re-elected. But what they have done in the time available to them, just as what Judith Troeth did in the three full terms during which she served, has left this chamber and our country a much, much better place by dint of their efforts.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  I want to pay my respects and acknowledgement to all the retiring senators of this Senate, but this evening we are here to talk about our experiences with Senator Barnett, Senator Trood and Senator Troeth. Senator Trood: as a Queenslander, thank you. I was not thrilled on the night of your election but, from the experience we have had since, I particularly acknowledge your work with young people and in education. Many people have spoken about your work in foreign affairs. I have seen that in Senate estimates committees, including in the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, and when we had the opportunity to travel to Africa together. I am aware of the professional knowledge and experience you have as well as your acute assessment and strategic knowledge in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell and I have had the chance to talk with young people in Queensland through the Constitutional Convention process and also to work with some schools that were particularly interested in how the Constitution operates and the respect, knowledge and dedication of those who work in this place. Russell, you have been truly inspirational. The young people can sense that. They know the role senators have, the responsibilities they have and the way that they can be dedicated to effective policy and make sure that they make a difference. Senators, despite their political differences, can work effectively together when talking about something that they treasure. Russell, the work you have done through the education process in Queensland will be remembered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that one of the worst places to be is between you and your coffee. On a number of occasions, when arriving at places and getting ready to talk, we have had to wait just a little because Senator Trood has been in search of good coffee. I will not mention the regional centre in Queensland which Russell has damned because strong coffee was not available for him in the mornings before we started our presentations! In the time I have known Russell I have never seen him quite so discomfited. To his credit, he immediately went into a discussion with young people on the intricacies of the wild rivers legislation, bringing to it great preparation and consideration of the range of issues. That is one of the strongest skills that a senator can have. So thank you, Russell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Barnett, Guy: we know there are very many issues on which we disagree, but throughout some quite significant debates and interactions there has always been goodwill and respect. I value that. As part of the group that was with you last evening, I know the genuine respect, affection and loyalty that so many people in the diabetes area have for you, and that has been reflected in your new appointment. You have energy, commitment and true joy in seeing results. Having shared many adjournment sessions with you, I put on record my appreciation for the many times you have been flexible and helped us out when we have been trying to balance chair duty—and Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin would know this—and speaking duties. We could always do it. That will always be a special memory. I think that I have got to know at least half the Tasmanian population, because you have mentioned them in adjournment speeches in this place over the last years. I would sit in awe as we would find out about people who were members of various organisations across the country, and occasionally I would recognise repeated names. We knew that the work you were doing in Tasmania meant so much to you and that you were here to represent and to be part of the true Tasmanian spirit. So congratulations. It has been a pleasure working with you on the things on which we do agree, particularly in the areas of the student leadership program, health and making sure that our young people know that they have futures. No-one will forget the work you did on the Kids in the House program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to put on record some words about Senator Judith Troeth. Senator Troeth, you are a true inspiration. I have seen that from the time I first came into this place. You were particularly generous in sharing with me your knowledge on a number of committees when I was very new, and I respect the way you would perform the role of chair with grace and dignity, making sure that there was appropriate behaviour at all times in the committee. That is not an easy task and I do respect the way you did it. I have read your first speech, as many people have. It is one of those things about first speeches: they do come back, don't they? This evening with the three senators we have heard comparisons drawn with their first speeches and their final contributions in this place. I read your speech, Senator Troeth, and I wish I had made it—except for those few things about the Liberal Party; nonetheless, you brought forward issues around the role of women in our community and the need for having more women involved in our participatory parliamentary process. So many of us value and respect and are actually challenged by you. In terms of the work you have done for rural women in particular, and the story about the rural women of the year, we can celebrate those occasions and see the joy of the achievements of other women, and we are all made stronger by it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the process around the private member's bill—we have Senator Nash with us in the chamber, and I know that Senator Lyn Allison sends her very best wishes to you—there was a special solidarity, and no-one can forget that there was a spirit of joy. I really want to reiterate the term 'joy' in the way that that process was done. It does not matter whether you were someone who felt differently about the principle; we acknowledged that and, through the whole process, we acknowledged that we were supporting a case other people found difficult. The four of us and many supporters, staff and women across the community—across the world, in fact—were engaged in the process and wanted to be part of that and to provide support. Senator Troeth, that would not have happened without you. There is no way. Your seniority, your professionalism and the fact that you were respected by so many people in both chambers of this place made the process more effective and led to important public policy in this country</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can still remember sitting beside you in the House of Representatives—when we were finally allowed in, which was quite difficult, but we got into the green chamber. There was so much emotion and tension around, and we were all being extraordinarily well behaved, because it was important that we were. We watched the proceedings and they went on for so many minutes. People tell me what happened, but I think I was in a bit of a daze for a lot of it; we were waiting to see what happened. At the end, when we saw that the policy that we were supporting had been successful, Judith Troeth—who had remained so professional and so calm and ensured that we were all behaving well, as I said—leapt to her feet and let out a shout of joy. It was something that I had not seen leading up to that moment. In that one moment, Senator Troeth, you actually expressed for me, and for so many other people, the way that you can make a difference when you work together, and you can express your feelings when it happens. I have told you before, but I wanted to put on record in this place how important your role  was. We all know that, and we are made better by it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the commitment that you have shown to your constituents and the people across your state but most particularly—and you have never forgotten—the commitment you have shown to women and the need for them to be respected, to have representation and to know that they are valued and have a role in public policy, I want to say thank you. I want to say 'thank you for the challenge' and I want to wish you good luck for any future challenges.</span>

                  <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I want to speak briefly about my three departing colleagues. Senator Barnett might not remember this, but we first met in about 1988 or 1989 on a spiritual retreat which had been organised by our mutual good friend Ross Cameron, who was in the gallery earlier today. At the time I was a callow youth, just a young party member, and Guy was a very senior member of the Tasmanian division. I was very impressed with Guy's wisdom and with the integrity that he had and maintains. It was a real delight in the years ahead when I got to work with Guy as a Howard government staffer and then as a colleague.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Barnett has been a good and faithful servant of his state, his party and the nation. I have particularly valued and appreciated his passion and commitment from a portfolio perspective in the voluntary sector. He has had a lot of great policy ideas and I look forward to trying to execute some of those in the years ahead. He has been a thorough, diligent and effective colleague, as Senator Brandis has so eloquently said, and I will certainly miss his contribution in this place. But, Guy, we will certainly stay in touch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to Senator Troeth, who has faithfully served my state of Victoria. Senator Troeth is one of two colleagues in this place around whom I always feel that I have to enunciate correctly. Around Senator Troeth and Senator Payne I am always very aware that I should make sure that my elocution is correct. Senator Troeth is the sort of person who is always proper. Senator Troeth has, as they say, a great backstory. She has always been a robust contributor in this place. With her, I took particular delight in the election of Russell Broadbent; we both made a particular contribution in that vein, and that was a great time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been commented on already, Senator Troeth is independent of mind. She has done something which I also have done in this place, and that is to move to the other side of the chamber, or 'cross the floor', as it is put. I might not have agreed with Senator Troeth in the exercise of that right, and she would not have agreed with my exercise of it in relation to the ETS debate; nevertheless, I always respected her right to do so. It is a right which our party jealously guards, and I think that is an important distinction between this side of the chamber and the other. I certainly wish Judith well in the years ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do particularly, however, want to make comment on Senator Professor Dr Russell Trood. I do not think that is the longest title that anyone in this place has ever had; I think that honour goes to Senator the Hon. Dr Kay Patterson. But both are indeed distinguished. Senator Trood and I were bench buddies for many years. In fact, when I first came into this place, shortly before Senator Trood, I was sitting on my own. Russell was my first bench buddy. You do tend to move around this chamber from time to time, but whenever there was a need to change seating arrangements in this place, Russell Trood and I said that we were happy to sit anywhere in the chamber as long as we were sitting next to each other—that is no reflection on our colleagues, but it certainly served us well. Those years that I had the privilege of sharing the bench with Russell I will remember very fondly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell is the very model of a senator. He is the senator from central casting. He is thoughtful, deliberative and widely read. He has a passion for good policy. He is curious, inquiring and independent of mind. Senator Trood is—and I think this is the highest tribute that I can pay to a colleague—one of the substantial figures of the Australian Senate. It is my hope that Russell's absence from this place will, in line with his academic heritage, prove to be a mere sabbatical. Senator Trood—Russell—we will see you soon, my friend.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5d" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  It is always sad to hear a valedictory speech, but it is even sadder if you do not, because it probably means you died in the job! Just quickly: I note that my good friend and colleague Senator Nash will have more words to say about Judith Troeth, and, for brevity, I will concentrate on two. But, just at the start, I will say: Judith, you have always held your office with complete dignity. I, too, was always in a quandary as to whether you were scolding me or you talked like that all the time. In the appropriateness of how you have conducted yourself, you have some great fans—including my mother, amongst others. What I do admire about Judith and Guy—and I think they are a good juxtaposition—is that they were both absol­utely foremost in the debates on some of the heavier issues in this chamber. And both conducted themselves in the appropriate manner, noting how strongly people felt on either side of those debates. It is somewhat of a concern to see two people who were foremost on the harder issues leaving at the same time. Maybe it is a balance that they both are leaving, but also it is tinged with sadness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To move to Guy: in a different manner, I always saw Guy as a fellow traveller on the right-to-life issues, and I want, at the start, to congratulate Guy for the work he has done on that matter. I thank him for his diligence and for his capacity to focus on the cause and his capacity to accept that, generally, we were on the losing side of those debates and yet to never give up heart and to soldier on for what one believes is right. It is a great sadness, Guy, to see you go. I know at times I would get phone calls from you, generally when you were not happy with me or something I had done. But I just want to thank you for all the effort you have put in and note that your resoluteness in that cause will continue on, and I want to say that I appreciate that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Guy, I also want to thank you for your work on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. You took that committee to a level where it was independent, professional and diligent. That is also a reflection of your capabilities both as a person coming from the legal profession and as a person who always had, from what I could see, extremely good time management skills, given your capacity to get through a quantity of work, to do it without fuss or bother and to get to a result. Your time management skills around this place, when we look at the things you have done, have been exceptional. If a book was written about how to be an effective senator and everybody contributed their part, I think there would be a chapter by you about how to participate in the Senate in such a way as to have the greatest and most effective involvement and about how to utilise the best part of your day. Your chapter would cover your playing tennis in the morning—which I know you are very keen on—your work with diabetes, your work in causes such as right to life, your work in the Senate committees and your writing of articles and books. The way you have conducted yourself is quite incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a conservative, as I have to call myself, I have always appreciated your work as a conservative. This chamber may be divided between different parties, but I think people have a general idea of where people stand, and your role as a conservative has been much appreciated. School chaplaincy is another area on which I can remember you working. Your work in this area has effect to this day, and I hope that you get a sense of joy every time you go past a school and see that it has a chaplaincy service. You can reflect on your time this place and what you have contributed to our nation, in this case the way you have reinforced and promoted the idea that schools should have a support mechanism for kids at school during some of the tougher times they go through. At the start people were very cynical about it, but now, if you tried to remove school chaplaincy, there would be a riot. State schools around me really appreciate the work that school chaplaincy does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a strong connection, in a funny way, between Guy Barnett and Russell Trood. I think we should reflect on the fact that Russell was elected to the Senate by reason of our capacity to harvest votes in myriad ways. Russell has lost his job because we have lost our capacity to harvest those jobs, and in a funny way so has Guy. In the Senate—though not so much in the other place—we have to be aware of and in tune with the realities of the political marketplace: that votes are harvested in myriad ways, that sometimes people will go shopping with their vote in the Senate and that, if we narrow our net, we will not catch more fish. We have to make sure that we keep our minds open to how we maintain our numbers in this place. I hope that the people of Tasmania will reflect on the question of whether another person with the attributes of Guy Barnett can get across the line, because there is no point in having two Tasmanian senators here in each cycle when we could have three. I think we need to be aware of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Guy, I do not know whether you made more speeches in the adjournment debate than did Santo Santoro, but I reckon you would be up there, mate! Every night was another chapter in the life and times of Guy Barnett.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell, in speaking about you I have to reflect on the start. At the start there was a time when both Russell and I had the improbable task of being up against a sitting Democrat, when the Greens were in the ascendancy and when Pauline Hanson—who was almost an iconic figure—was a sitting One Nation member. Then there were two other people: Russell, who would have had the main billing, and I, whom they had not thought of and were not even considering. It was an extremely torrid time and really put under stress the relationships in the coalition as a whole, because it was a fight to the death. Russell and I fought so well that we both got in, which was a good outcome, and it reflected what you can achieve when you work hard for a vote. We got four senators elected then. Competition is a great thing, and it sometimes breeds the best and the best outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a mark of the character of Russell that there was never any malice in his conduct; I never saw any malice in the way that he conducted things. I do apologise somewhat because after our election to the Senate there was an intense focus on my role, when I was not in fact the last senator elected; Russell was. I think that Russell was cursed by the better side of his nature in that he is a taciturn and considered person and did not want to participate in the limelight—and in that respect he is like me. For me it was self-preservation, but Russell had the dignity to maintain his poise, and I have always respected him for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell is also incredibly erudite. His work has always been of the highest quality. Even the speech that he gave tonight was a reflection of that quality and of the acumen that goes into his statements—how considered they are, even the word craft of them. He does not accept second best. All his words are put together in such a way that it is a joy to listen to him, even though at times it can attain such a level that you start to lose sight of the true complexities of what he is saying. That is the nature of Russell Trood. He is a person who has put the utmost work into his profession as a senator. Everybody has been making the same generic comment that he is the model of what a senator should be and how they should conduct themselves. In the chapter of that book about what you should be if you are a senator, if Guy was writing the chapter on time management, Russell would write his chapter on the quality of work and how you can deliver outcomes of quality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell always has been, in the proper sense of the word, a gentleman. Sometimes people find that statement mundane, but I do not think you would find a person around here, on either side of the chamber, who has a bad word to say about him. Once more, it is a credit to him that he has always treated people with respect. He has conducted his work in this place in a completely and utterly professional way. I suppose that is why he leaves here respected by all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We get to the inevitable end—the fourth person from the conservative side of politics, if that is the way to say it. I do not know how else you would say it. There were two teams or two parties fighting it out; now we have one. Obviously the writing was on the wall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At that point in time, the pressures on Russell would no doubt have been immense, yet there is nothing—nothing that people can go to, any media piece or anything that was said—that showed any bitterness or any opprobrium. He saw his fate and was completely as he was all the way through, completely dignified to the end. I hope it is not an epitaph and I hope there continues to be an engagement by Russell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this valete speech amongst all senators, I can say that in the country areas at first people did not know Russell, but once they knew him they respected him immensely. Everywhere he went he touched people. He was known for his quiet nature, his absolute diligence, his academic capacity and the dignity with which he dealt with every person he came across.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Russell, to Queensland and to this Senate you are a great loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Guy and Russell, I am sure, as Senator Brandis said, that it is 'au revoir', not 'adieu'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Judith, you have also done the very best and you have been an adornment in the way you have conducted yourself in this chamber.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  I want to briefly assoc­iate myself with the remarks made by my colleagues to our three retiring senators. The brevity of my remarks is in no way an indication of the expansive regard in which I hold all three retiring senators. This is an occasion when you can absolutely trust and agree with as truthful all of the words said by all of the previous speakers, even including those from the other side of the chamber. Most of the praiseworthy things have been said. I just want to associate myself with those very fine words, because I am aware that a lot of my colleagues want to speak tonight and time is short.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We lose three very fine senators, each of whom, in their own way, has made a very substantial contribution to this Senate, to the parliament, to the nation, to his or her state and, indeed, in these three cases, to the Liberal Party, of which they are all members. I know, as everyone else has also said, that each will have a future in public life in one way or another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must briefly mention Judith Troeth, whom I was delighted to see come to the Senate all those years ago. She joined me as one of the few senators from our state who actually lived in the country and had roots in the country, and we were both Liberals. This does not mean much to me these days because now in Queensland we are all one big happy family, but in those days it was very important to me that Judith as a rural woman had come into the parliament as a Liberal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I well remember the way Judith fought for rural issues in particular in those early days. I shared some time with Judith in the ministry in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry portfolio. I was very conscious of the work that Judith did in research and development in the organisations there and in many other ways—the way she promoted women in rural industries and in many things that occurred in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank Judith for the guidance she gave me on the RU486 debate. I always thought I agreed with them; I did not quite understand why. Sorry, Guy, but it was Judith who was able to confirm to me that what I was doing was correct. I particularly appreciated that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not go on with my remarks on all three or any of the three because all of the things have been said. I just say ever so briefly of Guy that he is a very passionate exponent of Tasmania. It is good that you are passionate, because some would say there is not much to be passionate about in Tasmania. I know that is wrong. I was spending a lot of time in Tasmania when Guy first entered the Senate. I had a lot to do with him; both of us were trying to help forestry and fisheries in particular in Tasmania in those days. I have known Guy's passion for Tasmania and everything that happens there and all the other causes that have been mentioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Guy, I am certain that you will have a future in public life. I know the government in Victoria is just waiting for Judith Troeth to be available to do good things. I have no inside information; I just know that the sort of person that Judith is will always find some sort of role in public life. Similarly with Guy, I was sort of having a wager with him on whether it would be federal parliament, state parliament, local government or perhaps something international but I am sure that Guy will not be lost from public service, and that will be to the benefit of Tasmania and indeed Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell is a Queenslander, of course. Russell is a person who really did, as a Queensland senator, change the world, with a remarkable election six years ago. Russell actually changed the dynamics of politics in Australia for those first three or four years. Russell's expertise and indeed the expertise of all of my colleagues who are leaving is demonstrated in the speeches that they have given tonight. Again, I know that Russell will continue in public service, be it political, academic or perhaps international. I said that any government who did not take advantage of Russell's expertise and experience would be seriously failing in their duty to Australia. In that comment I particularly join with—as I rarely do—the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who made a similar reference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All three, as I say, have made a very significant contribution. I wish all three publicly, as I have done and will do privately, all the very best in the future for them and their families and in their future roles. I am sure it will just be a brief departure from public life and I am sure we will see them around somewhere in the future. All the very best to you all.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator NASH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I want to echo the remarks that have been made this evening about the three departing colleagues, whom we are going to miss. I also echo Senator Macdonald in saying that the brevity of my remarks in no way reflects on the expansive comments I would like to make, but I am very conscious that there are many colleagues who still want to make a contribution. Certainly, Senator Barnett, I have always been incredibly impressed by your dedication and your tenacity regarding the issues that are important to you. I think that is a view that, as we have seen tonight, has been held by many of us for a very long time, and I wish you all the very best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Senator Trood, with whom I have had most interesting conversations and who has tried to sculpt my path into foreign affairs, with some success, It has been a delight to work with you and I must echo Senator Joyce's comments about your word craft. There is no doubt that to me, as a student of English and a grammar pedant, you are an artist who paints with the English word. It is a trait that is not always found in this place and one that has been very well recognised. All the best to you too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some comments about my very good friend and colleague Senator Troeth. In this place it is not often you hear the words 'poise' and 'steely' used in relation to the same person. There are not too many women in the National Party room—we have peaked at three so far and at the moment it is just me. It has been a real joy to have a woman in the Senate on this side of parliament to whom I have been able to look for advice and support. She has given me that support and advice with great grace as necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth probably does not remember but I actually met her around 10 years ago when I was a staffer for the Hon. Larry Anthony. Very briefly, he had an issue he was trying to change the then parliamentary secretary's mind about so off we went to see the parliamentary secretary. We came out a very short time later and I thought, 'Minister: one; Larry Anthony: nil'. There was no way in the world that Larry Anthony was going to change Senator Troeth's mind, and I was very impressed by the way this woman who I had not met before handled that meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Senator Troeth was chairing the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee and we were doing the legislation for Work Choices, all I can say is that I truly came to understand the phrase, 'Brook no argument'. As the chair of the committee it was an extraordinary time. Senator Troeth did a job steering that committee through that period that I think no other senator could have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a time in this chamber when Senator Troeth gave a speech on her view of the emissions trading scheme. I do not think I have heard a better speech given in this place than the speech that Senator Troeth gave that day. I completely disagreed with what she was saying, but that speech was so well crafted and so brilliantly given that for a moment there I almost found myself agreeing with her—but I pulled myself back from the brink and thought, 'No, don't go to the side of the darkness.' I just wanted to commend her on that. In spite of the fact that I did not agree with what she was saying, it was a most extraordinary speech and one of the best speeches that had been given in this place for quite some time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some commentary made about what we did with Senator Moore and Senator Allison with respect to the administrative changes to RU486. I have to say, Senator Troeth, that, when asked, you did not flinch in giving advice about, and support and strength to, that particular piece of legislation. Regardless of the fact that there were very different views about that piece of legislation—it was indeed a very torrid time—there are two things that occur to me about that whole process, neither of which are related to the issue itself. One is the ability for women from all parties to come together and work on a common issue, which to my knowledge had not happened before that time, and it will probably be some time until we see it again. That was something that I will always value. The other was associated with that but, again, is not to do with the issue. We all in this place work hard and hope to be appreciated, and we hope that what we do is appreciated by the community out there. We walked out of this chamber after the successful conclusion to the legislation and Senator Troeth's son was walking towards her. He just looked at her and said, 'Mum!' and gave her a big hug. The reason I say that is that there is probably no greater accolade in this place than our children being proud of us for what we do, and I think that was a most extraordinary moment. Senator Troeth, you probably have more strength than any man I know. You probably have more intelligence and more class than any woman I know. There will be a real void in this place when you leave. There will be many senators yet to come but, no matter how many come, I suspect that void will never quite be filled.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I would like to make some brief remarks also about my departing colleagues, firstly, about Judith Troeth. Judith has made an outstanding contribution to the Senate in her time in many ways, including, as Senator Nash has just said, in her role as a parliamentary secretary responsible for the interests of the rural sector. She was greatly respected for her very firm views about issues and about how things should be done and carried out that job with a great deal of success. She was widely admired for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that Judith Troeth was a person who held to her convictions has been mentioned already by a number of speakers. It is not always easy in this place to do this. It sometimes takes great courage and forbearance to adhere to your convictions, sometimes in the face of disagreement from members of your own party. But Judith has shown that courage and forbearance and she has thereby earned the respect of all members of the Senate for having done so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a lighter note, Judith and I have shared an enjoyment of films and, after breaks from the Senate, have shared with each other our views on the various films we saw during that break. While we did not always agree on the value, the quality and the worthwhileness of the films we saw, at other times we certainly tipped each other off on some very enjoyable and entertaining films. I thank you very much, Judith, for your interest in films. You will be sadly missed in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to Guy Barnett. Guy, in his period in the Senate, has made a great contribution in two particular areas, which I will mention. Firstly, Guy was renowned as a driver of the need for increased recognition of the problems faced by those who have diabetes. He has made an outstanding contribution to the cause of more research and a greater understanding of the pathology of diabetes and the treatment of it and has taken this concern about diabetes into the public arena. The Australian community, Guy, owes you a great debt for what you have done in promoting the understanding of diabetes and the need for there to be better treatment facilities, particularly for children. Children find diabetes very difficult to cope with, particularly small children who have type 1 diabetes and who have to inject themselves, as we heard only yesterday at the event which was held in the Mural Hall. I thank you for what you have done in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue for which Guy Barnett earned my great respect was his opposition to the Victorian legislation permitting mid-term abortions for babies with even the most minor congenital abnormalities, as was detailed in evidence provided a few years ago to a Senate committee inquiry into the provision of Medicare rebates for these procedures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the impression left by the evidence given at that inquiry was that Australia, at least Victoria, was moving down a pathway where eugenics were becoming a consider­ation as to whether or not a baby should be allowed to live. The comparisons which some people drew between the implications of the Victorian mid-term abortion legislation and its practice and the notorious T4 Program, which existed in Hitler's Germany, was not in my opinion misplaced. The theme in both cases was the same, that only perfect human beings should be allowed to live. As a person who quite obviously has a short-limb condition which would, under Victorian legislation, be an unequivocal ground for termination of a pregnancy—as was stated by the then President of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at those hearings—but who, like many others with congenital conditions, has lived a successful life and had a successful career, I very greatly respect Guy Barnett for his moral courage in taking a stand against what I regard as pernicious Victorian legislation, which so devalues human life and the potential of human beings to not let themselves be disadvantaged by not being physically perfect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I would like to turn to my esteemed colleague Russell Trood. As has been said by many others, Russell Trood is a universally respected figure in the Senate, both for his innate dignity and his great knowledge of international affairs. International affairs is a matter which I too have a great interest in, and in fact I hold a degree from Murdoch University which focused on East Asian politics and Australia's role in the region. I have to say that I have always greatly respected Russell's understanding of the importance of Australia's need to engage with the nations in our region as being the key to the long-term future of Australia and its role in this part of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All three senators have been great colleagues and have made great and substantial contributions to the Senate and I wish all three of them all the best for their future endeavours. I am sure that all will continue to contribute to public affairs and leave their marks in whatever they do in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="2M6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COONAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  I wish to associate myself with earlier comments paying tribute to esteemed colleagues whose times will shortly expire and who will be leaving this place shortly, namely, Senators Troeth, Barnett and Trood. I know that a lot of colleagues want to speak so I will be jumping around a little bit to try to capture the essence of what I want to say about each of these colleagues. All of these senators have graced this chamber with their presence and by the considerable contri­butions each has made, albeit in different fields and areas of expertise and interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it so challenging to try to capture the essence of a colleague's parliamentary career, which typically is diverse and broad in scope. As the speeches go on and the degrees of fabulousness get greater, it is ever more difficult to be able to properly capture rather than diminish the high regard in which they are held. For that reason, rather than attempt to catalogue the myriad public achievements of the three of them, I will just give a few personal reflections and observations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth represents and embodies a very important Victorian Liberal tradition, that of having a woman continually representing the state of Victoria since 1949 in this chamber. Judith has continued the tradition and has been a wonderful example of women selected on merit who have forged their careers in a not always accommodating environment. Judith has been a strong representative for women and particularly for rural women across Australia, as others have said. Having that great credential of being from a farming background, as a wife and mother of five children I also come from a rural background, and when  someone the other day referred to me as 'Sydney Helen', I did not really know whether to be insulted or not. But Judith of course has got absolutely impeccable credentials to represent her rural constituency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She has been an indefatigable worker. I am currently chair of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and I think that she was also chair and a very effective parliamentary secretary, as others have said, to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and the minister for agriculture. On top of all that, her hard work on various Senate committees is topped only by the list of foreign countries she visited during the years she served in the Senate. But these were not the normal places. Our Judith has been to Ethiopia and Tanzania and Mongolia and East Timor, which just shows the interest she has in the far-flung places around the globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, if anyone in this chamber has an impression of a mild-mannered senator, let me remind you, as other colleagues have, that Judith is a woman of passion and conviction, prepared to exercise her absolute right to take on unpopular positions particularly in her own party—never an easy thing to do—and to stand her ground even, if necessary, crossing the floor if she thought that was warranted. So there are two things I will always associate with Judith Troeth: her passion and her commitment to causes that she felt strongly about. But most of all, I will always value her friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second senator that I wish to quickly mention is Guy Barnett. Guy joined us after appointment by the Governor in 2002, replacing our great friend and colleague Senator the Hon. Brian Gibson. He had a stellar career as the youngest senior adviser to a state premier at the age of 25, and then of course as a successful owner and manager of his own government affairs and public relations business prior to his entry to the Senate. These are all things that will serve him well now. He was well qualified to contribute to the long line of very distinguished Tasmanian senators that we have in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From a party point of view, long before being appointed to the Senate, he was a member of the Liberal Party State Executive and Policy Committee, and Chair of its Constitution Review Committee from 1994 to 2001, no doubt ably calling on his legal background. So he is a passionate advocate for truth and transparency. We have all heard about these wonderful attributes of Guy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My very clear memory of Guy will always be associated with him working closely, even passionately, with me when I was the minister for communications on measures to protect Australian families online, and he always had valuable perspectives. He also had an almost equally passionate denuncia­tion of government waste, although I hasten to say that was not in my capacity as minister for communications. So, Guy, the people of Tasmania should be very proud of you, as we are, and I know that you will be able to use the many talents that you have innately and those you have developed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And as for last of the three amigos—I always like to use that word, drawing on my background as minister for communi­cations—I wish to talk about the stereotype of the diplomat rather than the senator. Senator Trood has performed superbly as a senator. A great friend from Queensland since his election, he came to the chamber as a fully-fledged lawyer and university lecturer. He served on various boards, either as president or board member, such as the Australian Institute of International Affairs, the Australia Indonesia Institute and the Foreign Affairs Council—all before he entered politics. As others have said, he served our party not surprisingly in a most distinguished role as Chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, a member of the state executive and as Vice-Chair of the Liberal Party Development Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have heard it said of Senator Trood, when Senate estimates come around, as indeed Senator Evans confirmed, even the most senior bureaucrats are concerned that there is a senator who knows as much, if not more, than they do about their department and its work. But all of this has been very carefully camouflaged behind that urbane, civilised and cultured manner. When I was appointed shadow foreign minister by Malcolm Turnbull I called on Senator Trood several times to represent both me and the coalition at various state functions, totally confident in the knowledge that he would always enhance our position. He never let me down and he has never let us down. He has a deserved reputation for his calm, thoughtful and strong contributions, always listened to, always worth listening to. He is a rare talent, assisted and perfected by his university lecturing over many years, and more recently his visiting fellowship at the Lowy Institute for International Policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that others want to talk about the three of you. As I said when I started, the briefness of my contribution is in no way meant to diminish the great regard in which I hold all of you. You will be very much missed in the chamber. We are losing three very valuable senators on our side who have made a significant contribution not just to us but to the body politic of this great Senate and to the national debate, both individually and jointly. You will be missed. I salute you and thank you and ask that you not be strangers to us in future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):   I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues across the chamber in relation to the three retiring Liberal senators. Senator Troeth has always been a very warm and friendly colleague. I did get to know her during my time in the organisation before I came to this place. It was some time after I realised a little of how this place worked that I understood the impact of some of the conversations I might have had with her before I came into the place. It has always been a very warm and friendly association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strength of Judith's work was demonstrated at the Rural Woman of the Year awards a couple of weeks ago. She did mention this in her speech earlier tonight: she was specifically recognised for the work that she had done in relation to the development of that award and the raising of its stature and its profile. Having had an association myself with that award, as her successor in the portfolio, I know how valuable it is and how much her work was valued in that area. Her legacy is more than well established through the agricultural sector and the portfolio. She very kindly left me alone and allowed me to make my mistakes and stumble through my early days in the portfolio, however difficult it might have been for her, having gone through that change process. I very much appreciate the fact that she was prepared to do that, although I did notice her smiling knowingly during some of the occasions when I was dealing with my colleagues in relation to some of the industry fees and levies. I know that she had her moments. I certainly had my own, as well—the knowing smile remains. Judith, all the very best for the future. It really has been great working with you and I appreciate the collegiate and friendly nature of our interactions. I wish you all the very best into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have not had a huge interaction with Senator Russell Trood during my time here. Because of the nature of this place and the committees we work on, we are often in different places at different times. But I have had the great pleasure of Russell's company a number of times at social events and dinners where we have had the opportunity to sit down. Like all the others who have spoken here before me, I do recognise what Russell has brought to this place. He has always been held in high respect across this chamber for his knowledge and his wealth of research. I certainly hope he remains a friend into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This valedictory process that we are undertaking in this couple of weeks actually demonstrates the strength and the value that the diversity of members of this chamber brings to the chamber's work—the ideas, the expertise and the experience that members bring to this chamber, to the parliament generally and more broadly to what we do. Some of the things that have been said about colleagues tonight and particularly Russell demonstrate the real value of all of those things that come to this place. None of us are the holder of all wisdom, and the strength of this place is being able to work together, as we do in the committees that we are all part of, on so many occasions. Sometimes it can be combative but more often than not, particularly within the committees and the work that we do there, we are genuinely looking to make things better and to find solutions. If we are prepared to work with and consider the ideas of everybody else that sits around the table then more often than not we will come up with a better result. Quite obviously, from what has been said here tonight, Russell's contribution really signifies the value of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I turn to my Tasmanian colleague Senator Guy Barnett. Guy and I go back quite a long way within the Liberal Party organisation in Tasmania. I have not been a member for as long as Guy has—I was not underage when I joined. I had been doing a few other things before I was invited to join the party. But we worked very closely together on a range of things within the organisation. Guy has served the Liberal Party in Tasmania extensively on its constitutional review committee.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator COLBECK:</span>
                  </a>  You just cannot keep a good guy down, I suppose, Guy. When I was state president we worked quite closely together on a range of things including reform of elements of the party. As Guy mentioned in his speech, that process continues. It is a long relationship. It goes back 20-odd years now. We were competitors in and around the preselection process. In fact, we had some pretty friendly conversations about who was who in the zoo at particular times, but we walked away quite content that we would compete with each other on our merits. One thing I will say about my interactions with Guy—and this is, unfortunately, something which does not happen within preselection processes—is that we were prepared to compete with each other on our merits rather than trying to drag each other down. I certainly appreciated that process, Guy. When we finally got to the stage of starting our parliamentary careers, we started here within a month of each other. It is through the cruel vagaries of the political process that, unfortunately, Guy is leaving us. He still has a lot to offer in public life. He has hinted at that during his speech here tonight, and I think that is appropriate. One thing that I think Guy's nine years in this chamber has done is provide him with the tools and skills to set himself up with a large number of options. I was delighted to hear that he is taking up some representative work for something that he has become synonymous with—that is, diabetes. It is highly appropriate that Guy takes that up because we all know the strength of passion that he has for that cause. Obviously he has a personal reason for doing that, but it is not necessary, from Guy's perspective, to have a personal reason to be involved with an issue. One thing about Guy: if you have him on your side on an issue, you know that there is somebody who is just not going to let go. As much as people might like him to let go on occasions, once he is set on a path that is it; he will fight alongside you right through the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflected at his valedictory dinner a week or so ago, which again demonstrated how well regarded he is in our home state of Tasmania, that he was prepared to take up the really tough issues and to go into places where it was difficult to go. I recall in the lead-up to the election the state government had made some decisions to close hospitals at Rosebery and Ouse. Rosebery, being a mining town, is what you would call dead red Labor; she is a pretty tough place for us conservatives. I can recall campaigning down there for a day at the senior citizens and thinking I was doing a wonderful job. At the end of it they said: 'Well it's been great to meet you. We think you're a lovely bloke, but Dick Adams is good fella too.' That is the nature of the place; they are very set in their ways. But the campaign that Guy waged down there brought close to a 25 per cent swing in that seat. It was Guy's strength of advocacy that really provided the impetus for people to change their vote—which is not an easy thing to get people to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is that strength of advocacy and those skills that Guy has built up over the past nine years in this place that will provide him with an enormous range of options. I am sure that we will see him working into the future. I wish Guy and his family all the best, as I do my other colleagues, and I look forward to working with him not only for the Liberal cause but for the community into the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FORSHAW</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  Mr Acting Deputy President, I will be very brief. I did get the opportunity last night in my own valedictory to extend best wishes to Senators Troeth, Barnett and Trood. The brevity of my remarks tonight is in no way an indication of the respect I have for each of them and the best wishes that I wish to extend to them. I apologise that I was not here to hear their valedictories. I was doing what all of us are often doing; I was attending a committee meeting, working on a report on Australia's relations with Africa. I will read the speeches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to Senator Guy Barnett, he is somebody who I have known all of the time he has been here, but I have not worked on that many occasions with him on committees, except most recently on the territories bill, which was an interesting experience. My association with him has been through his work with the friends of diabetes—that does not mean we like diabetes; it is the group that does such great work. Senator Barnett has been at the forefront of that group's work. And may he continue to ride that bike, too. We shared a plane to Coffs Harbour recently. I arrived and got in a cab and went to the hotel and Guy got in a bigger van and then took his bike with him to ride up the mountain, which I thought was pretty crazy! But congratulations to Guy on all of the great work he has done for that wonderful cause, and best wishes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to be here, but the Senate is certainly going to miss Senator Trood because of his excellent work on foreign affairs. I have already referred to that. He, like each of the senators, including me, has been in that terrible spot on the Senate ticket where your future hangs in the balance. Unfortunately, from his perspective and his party's perspective, he was not re-elected. His talent and expertise in foreign affairs will be missed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I go to Senator Troeth, whom I have known for many years and worked with on a number of committees—including rural and regional in particular and, most importantly for both of us, the Public Works Committee. She has been the deputy chair of that committee for a long time. That is a terrific committee. It does a lot of great work. It is not always written up in lights, but Senator Troeth has been a superb participant. There is also her work for the IPU. We enjoyed a very hardworking trip to Geneva and Paris last year. Best wishes to you all, and I hope to catch up with you all in our respective retirements.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6V" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  A few weeks ago, at a primary school in Brisbane, a grade 5 student asked me the question, 'Do you have to be good at stuff to be a politician?' My first reaction was to say, 'No'. I had to think about it for a minute. I said: 'You need to be good at reading. And you wouldn't want to be frightened of speaking in public, or your job would be a nightmare.' Then I got into the groove and went on to say the diversity of gender, age, experience and background is what makes parliament a good place and means that we make great laws. I would like to look at our three retiring senators from this side tonight and see it as a great celebration of the Liberal Party and the way it promotes diversity—the different paths and the different backgrounds of our three senators. I also will be very brief because there are others who want to say something. I would initially like to recognise the great and very principled contribution—not always contributions I have agreed with—that Senator Guy Barnett has made to this place. It may not be well known, but Senator Guy Barnett and I share the fact that a close relative of each of us has died of motor neurone disease. His advocacy in this area has been just as passionate and just as long-term and loyal as it has been in the area of diabetes. I am honoured that he has asked me if I would take on some of the advocacy for motor neurone disease in this place. They are big shoes to fill, but thank you for asking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Trood and I have spent time on the hustings—I think since 2001 we have shared Senate tickets and the like. It certainly is a way to get to know someone. I must associate myself with the remarks that Senator Joyce made about how initially in country areas sometimes people would wonder at the erudite Senator Trood. But the minute he started to speak to them, the minute he understood their issues, the minute they realised that he could reflect back to them their needs, the views changed. I remember one night in the Roma shire council rooms meeting the council came up with what I found a slightly out-of-the-square solution to their lack of population: the idea of taking in boilermaker apprentices from China for a short course. This struck me as really outside the square, but Senator Trood immediately picked up on the fact that education services are one of our great exports, saw the benefits and expounded them in a way that made them far more understandable to me. That certainly is a role he has played throughout his time here. Senator Trood, we will miss you and I certainly hope that we will see you back here in the near future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator the Hon. Judith Troeth was the person I sat next to when I first came to the Senate. I filled a casual vacancy so I did not get to do the training courses that a lot of other people do. Thank you, Senator Troeth, for the 'get up now', 'sit down now', 'jump now', 'try and stretch that out a bit more' hints that you gave me. Thank you for your mentoring and for your advice around committees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been pretty obvious from what has been said here today that Senator Troeth has paid a far, far greater role in women's issues and assisting and promoting rural women and rural women's leadership—the RU486 debate, which is still talked about wherever women get together and discuss behaving in a bipartisan way in politics, and her comments regarding the disproportionate underrepresentation of women in parliament. I would like to quote from something that she said in a paper that she wrote on this topic in June 2010. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The residual disproportion of women in Parliament should not be seen as a women’s issue alone. It should be viewed as a challenge concerning every Australian as it goes to the heart of representative and responsible governance of this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Certainly the existing mechanism for getting more Liberal women into parliament is not working. Clearly this is something we need to address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth mentioned the need to jump-start the representation of women. I would support that view wholly and I would hope that the three retiring senators jump-start their future careers. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="KO6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUMPHRIES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I want to be brief because there is not much time and because in some ways these valedictory speeches are like real-time obituaries for the living. I suspect that my colleagues might be happy if it was brought to an end earlier than otherwise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to adopt almost everything that has been said about the three retiring senators, indicate my enormous pleasure at having served with them and the fact that I have learned from all of them, and give them my very best wishes for their futures. With regard to Senator Troeth, I want to record my pride that I was able to co-sponsor with her a couple of years ago the Independent Review of Terrorism Laws Bill—one of those rare pieces of private members' legislation which actually got up in the Senate. It did not pass into law but it has, I think, engendered other legislation to address the issue of reviewing the nature of terrorism laws. The spirit of Senator Troeth's leadership in the Senate on that was very much a legacy to all of us and one that I hope continues beyond her time here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members in this debate have commented on Senator Troeth's composure and her sense of being in control all the time, so it is it incumbent upon me to record one very conspicuous occasion in which that composure completely disappeared. It was on an occasion when the Chaser team was loose in the building. Their theme was that Mr Alan Cadman, the then member for Mitchell, should challenge Prime Minister Howard and become the new Prime Minister. Somehow they managed to trap Senator Troeth into an interview and they started with, 'What do you think of your colleague Alan Cadman,' and she dutifully told the camera that she very much admired him and that he was a great member of parliament and so on. They then came with the question, 'So you will be supporting his challenge to the Prime Minister in a few days time?' Senator Troeth dissolved into a great deal of panic on the screen. That was very evident. She lost her composure completely and was terrified by the thought that she might be aiding some kind of challenge to the Prime Minister. For a person who normally exhibits great self-control, it was something of a perverse joy to see her lose that temporarily. I am sure that she will take control of whatever it is that she goes on to do after her time in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Trood is one of those people that my late father would have described as 'a gentleman and a scholar', but in his case there would have been no sense of exaggeration or flattery. Although compari­sons are odious, the fact is that I think Senator Trood, of all the senators we are losing at this time, will be the one most missed, particularly with respect to the work of this chamber as a chamber of legislators–as a chamber of people who thoughtfully and carefully consider the legislation delivered to this place from the point of view of its benefit to the people of Australia. His contribution in so many ways to the work of the Senate, and particularly to the Senate committees, will be his legacy, and the loss of that contribution will be a great loss to the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there is my colleague Senator Barnett, who I think needs to be recorded as a man who absolutely saw his role in this place as being about making a difference. He came here with a very strong sense of what he wanted to achieve, and worked from the very first day–and will until the very last day–to make those things happen. Anybody who wants to be successful as a politician needs to look at the example that he sets of determination and conviction in politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think he might be characterised quite readily as a conservative Liberal, but I think it is fair to describe him as a Liberal of principle; a person who believes very strongly in certain principles and pursues those with great vigour. I recall, for example, visiting the then Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, to argue for some consideration to be given to the plight of one David Hicks. Guy Barnett was, in a sense, not a conservative that day. He simply wanted to defend the rights of an Australian who appeared to be overlooked in his treatment in the US judicial system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also, though, does need to be recorded that Senator Barnett was my partner and collaborator in, perhaps, my greatest misadventure in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Barnett:</span>
                  </a>  I'm very sorry about that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="KO6" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HUMPHRIES:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, I am very sorry about it too, Senator Barnett. In about 2003, Senator Barnett and I were giving a press conference to do with Medicare. I think Senator McLucas will recall that Medicare select committee. We were giving a press conference and the division bells rang, and because Senator Barnett was overly loquacious and had to answer the questions being asked at great length, when we finally got out of the press conference and ran to the chamber–I was faster than Senator Barnett but had to wait for him to catch up with me because he was slower than I was–we missed the division.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It may not have been a matter of great moment in ordinary circumstances, but as it happened this particular division was on the bill for the sale of Telstra. Our omission threatened the government with a $32 billion loss, and although the then Finance Minister, Senator Minchin, was quite forgiving of our tardiness and Senator Barnett's loquacious­ness, the then whip, the late Jeannie Ferris, was much less forgiving. I have never had such a fierce roasting at the hands of another politician as I had in the company of Senator Barnett that day. One day I will lift the curse on you, Senator Barnett, for inflicting the great indignity on me of being roasted by Senator Jeannie Ferris. But I know you will go on to do much greater things in your new role, and I want to finish by saying it has been a pleasure and a privilege to serve with all three of these senators.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  Before I proceed to talk to you about the issue I have on adjournment tonight I want to put forward my best wishes to the retiring senators who spoke tonight, Senators Troeth, Barnett and Trood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Troeth led, with three other senators, a moment in this parliament. The issue of RU486 showed we can come together as a parliament across political barriers to debate the issues that divide parties. I was so very happy to be able to be involved in that debate, and also very happy to see the leadership that was given by Senator Troeth and, of course, Senators Moore, Nash and Stott-Despoja. It was an extraordinary experience, and I thank you, Senator Troeth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I have to say to Senator Barnett–with whom I do not normally have too many issues that we agree on–that if he had given that speech when I was here in the beginning I think I would have had a different perspective on him. And if he had told me that the Pollie Pedal took in chocolate factories, wineries and cheese factories I think I would have been there, even though my cycling days are long gone. I also look forward to receiving the pedometer that he said he will give to each of us, because certainly I do need to pick up my fitness rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Trood has obviously been spoken of in glowing terms. Whilst I have not personally had much to do with Senator Trood in committee meetings we have had the occasional chat in the hallway, and I have always found him to be extraordinarily generous with his time and informative in the issues which he has been interested in. I thank all three senators for the time they have given to the Senate and I wish them well in their future endeavours. Tonight I would like to speak on mental health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we strive to build a more inclusive community and a more inclusive workforce here in Australia, the reality is that people with mental illness still face a number of setbacks and challenges. Those who have experienced mental illness can often find it difficult to fully participate in our society, in study or in the workplace whilst also trying to maintain their mental health. With at least one in every five Australians each year experiencing mental illness, there is no doubt that all of us here in this chamber have at some time supported a friend or a family member or perhaps endured our own personal challenge with mental illness. Too often we focus on what is not being done to promote awareness of mental illness or to support those who have suffered from or are caring for those with mental illness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, tonight I want to take this opportunity to share a few success stories in the area of mental health. I have had the privilege of attending a number of events associated with mental health services in Tasmania. At these events I have met with a range of inspirational people who are working hard to support those with mental illness in our community. I also have had the opportunity to meet with a number of people who have suffered from mental illness and who are now strong advocates for those with mental illness in our community. Many of these individuals have been willing to share their personal experiences—both the setbacks and the successes—as they continue to manage their mental health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One such event I attended was the launch of the National Disability Coordination Officer Program booklet. The Tasmanian NDCO, in conjunction with the University of Tasmania, Tasmanian Polytechnic, Mental Health Council of Tasmania, Advocacy Tasmania, Wise Employment, CRS Australia and Choose Employment, developed a resource for graduates from university or a VET course with mental illness who are making the transition to employment. The resource is appropriately titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Mountain Climbing: a resource for tertiary graduates with lived experience of mental illness making the transition to employment</span> and is the perfect way to describe the challenges faced by people who are trying to navigate their way through study and the workforce whilst maintaining their health. The resource chronicles personal triumphs and setbacks that a diverse range of jobseekers with mental illness have experienced in the pursuit of their careers. They also mythbust issues associated with mental illness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share just one of the many stories in the booklet. This is Ryan's story:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ryan turned 51 in August. When he was a little kid something bad happened to him that he doesn't like talking about. The doctors called it trauma and now they say he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ryan's had mental health issues all his life. He can count on one hand the years when his health has been plain sailing. But Ryan never gave in to his condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Over the years he built a strong support network made up of friends, family and counsellors. He spent time in hospitals in Tasmania and interstate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He worked more jobs than he can count but never got a qualification. Finally this year, he completed a Certificate IV in Counselling and landed a job at a Job Network straightaway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Even though he was really excited to be offered a role so quickly, Ryan found his anxiety build as the start date for the job drew nearer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When his first day arrived, Ryan was a wreck. His hands were shaking and his thoughts were racing. He knew he couldn't go to work in that state so he contacted his own Disability Employment Services provider and asked for help. His case manager helped him calm down and asked if he'd disclosed his mental health issues when he applied for the job. Ryan said he had disclosed so his case manager simply called the workplace and told them what had happened. Ryan went to see his psychiatrist who changed his medication. Two weeks later he started at the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In reading through this resource, you appreciate the mountain climbing metaphor that both inspires hope and fosters a sense of achievement. For people managing their mental health, the experience really is like navigating a mountain range rather than just climbing to the top of one summit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Keith Mahar describes in the foreword of the booklet—Keith is a native, or rather a Canadian, but one who now lives in Tasmania; he made a very wise choice—climbing a mountain requires us to prepare to tackle the challenge. This preparation involves insight, skills, knowledge, the right equipment and the support of a good team. With the right resources and the right networks, we know that we can support and equip those jobseekers to succeed in their journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no doubt this resource will give graduates and jobseekers with a mental illness the confidence to navigate pathways through study and into the workforce and beyond. I know this resource is already making a difference to the lives of people who refuse to let their mental illness stop them from building a career, giving them the tools necessary to navigate their own journey both in Tasmania and around Australia. Whilst we have some way to go in terms of building a better system and improving the way we care for and support people with mental illness, it is also important to celebrate resources such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mountain </span><span style="font-style:italic;">climbing </span>booklet as part of our progress so far. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Mountain climbing </span>booklet is also a resource that I hope will help assist prospective employers to understand more about mental illness and how they may best be able to support employees with a mental illness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, I am confident that there is a growing willingness amongst employers who foster a more inclusive workplace. At the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Awards function in Tasmania earlier this year, I had the benefit of hearing a number of Tasmanian employers share their stories about taking on employees with mental illness. I was heartened that so many employers were committed to supporting people with a mental illness in their transition back to the workforce. Those employers truly understand the importance of an inclusive workplace and were more than willing to negotiate flexible conditions for employees who were struggling to balance their work and their mental health. For those employees that I met at the CRS function, I truly appreciate that for them having a job was not about getting paid; it was about feeling connected to the workplace and to the community. They were able to feel comfortable disclosing their mental illness at the outset, which means that managing their mental health and their work responsibility was far less stressful. What is more, their employers are in a better position to provide them with the support they need to continue to carry out their jobs and stay healthy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The more we do in the community to build awareness of mental illness and break down the stigma, the more success stories I hope to hear.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5g" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator NASH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  I rise tonight to speak about a remarkable Australian, Charlie Francis from Forbes. Sadly, Charlie died last month and he is going to be terribly missed by his wonderful sister, Danie, her husband, Bob, and all of his family. Charlie farmed at Forbes and made a huge contribution to regional Australia. It is that contribution that I want to talk about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I probably would not be here if it had not been for Charlie Francis. I met Charlie over 15 years ago when I first became involved with the National Party at an electorate council meeting in Forbes. At the time I was struck by this fellow and his brother, Jack, and their absolute passion for regional Australia and doing whatever they could to make sure they made regional Australia a better place. Charlie and I went on to become firm friends and he was a wonderful guide and mentor to me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was one occasion, probably over 10 years ago now, when I was the electorate council chairman for the Lachlan electorate council, at that stage the seat held by the Hon. Ian Armstrong. To cut a very long story short, I was unceremoniously rolled out of the position of chairman. I drove home thinking that I really should not bother with this politics game any more. I was very miffed that this had happened and thought that I might as well leave the party and disappear if that was the sort of thing that was going to happen. Charlie rang me up that night and said, 'Lass, we need to have lunch; we're going to the Grenfell pub.' I went to the Grenfell pub and had lunch with Charlie. He had a way of looking at you: he would fix you with this gaze and he did that to me. We were having a gin and tonic in the Grenfell pub and he fixed me with his gaze. Knowing how terribly hurt and upset I was at being rolled out of this position and that I was quite likely going to pack up my bat and ball in a fit of pique and disappear, he looked at me and said, 'Lass, you can roll over or you can stand up and fight.' That struck a chord with me and immediately I started thinking: why should I let them get the better of me and huff and puff and roll? By the time I drove home after lunch with Charlie at the Grenfell pub I had decided that it would be a much better idea not to roll over but to stand up and fight—which I did. I stuck to it and I stuck to the party. That was largely due to Charlie Francis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charlie always had an opinion and he was relentless. He spent his entire life involved in the community and involved in things that he thought would make regional Australia a better place. He had an opinion on everything and mostly that opinion was pretty much right. When Charlie was 80-something—I cannot remember exactly how old he was—he had a way of being able to cut right to the core, right to the quick of issues and making sure that the right idea was being put forward. He was really quite extraordinary. He never wasted a moment. He was always on the phone and whenever he had yet another issue he would say, 'Lass, I need to talk to you.' He was just tremendous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charlie was particularly passionate about water. He watched the changes that this Labor government made to water policy over the last few years. He was terribly, terribly worried about the future of regional Australia because of these changes to the water policy. While he certainly understood the need for infrastructure improvement, he quite rightly raised with me one day: 'But, Lass, what about all of those people out in the bush who have already, of their own volition, made changes? They have already, of their own volition, improved their water infrastructure. What benefit is there going to be for them?' I think it was a really good point that we should be recognising the improvements that have already been made by so many of our farmers and irrigators across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, Charlie had been talking about dams and the importance of dams. He was passionate about them. He appeared on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbes Advocate</span> of 17 March this year, very recently:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"There is really only one solution, and that is more dams," Charlie Francis said this week after commenting on the future of the Lachlan Valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Francis needs no introduction being a past Shire President and advocate of better farming practices for producers along the Lachlan River and the Forbes district.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"There is a lifetime experience by the locals here, they know the river and that is why they should be listened to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"We cannot be told there will be no more dams, this is enormously important to the future of towns along the Lachlan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"I just feel it is crucially important, to the future of Forbes and to the future of our kids," Mr Francis said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charlie was passionate about water, and he was quite right in so many of the ideas he had for the future of water in this country. He was a man who understood how regional Australia works and how water works from generations of knowledge that had been passed down to him through his family and decades of his own understanding. He had the week before, on 29 March, a letter to the editor published in, again, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbes Advocate</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How many more times will producers and the communities that rely on them be forced to endure negative legislation imposed upon them by government? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's been the Native Vegetation Act, the carbon tax, threat of beef imports, mulesing bans, and the consistent deregulation of our markets to name but a few—and all of this with little consultation with the people whose lives these decisions mostly affect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But the most devastating policy threat to regional Australia's existence is the Murray Darling Basin plan—a plan driven by radical talk of climate change and born from the residue of a completely natural decade-long drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The single most important factor in the lives of all Australians is water, and the management of our water resources will determine the nation's population and the standard of living that future generations will enjoy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Governments let everyone be aware that they have "consulted the experts" but I am deeply concerned about the influence extended by academics on our water management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a seemingly endless stream of professors and scientists expressing opinions as absolute truths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As well-meaning as they may be, they cannot possibly grasp the complexities of the cyclical weather patterns that exist in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is, however, generations of experience living on our rivers right now and surely their input should be considered invaluable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have to throw away this plan and move to gauge the importance of the varying issues within each individual valley. Be it new dams, irrigation, flood control, pest control or the environment, the people must be consulted widely and not treated to ad hoc review committees and the usual government contempt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And once resolved, the future management of our rivers should then be handed to the same people who live and work on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Governments ought to tread carefully from here—the water plan has already been burnt in the streets and any further progression towards legislation that ignores regional communities will warrant more than burning paper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This issue can be resolved with country common sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that, if a few more people had the country common sense that Charlie Francis talked about, regional Australia would certainly be a better place. His country common sense served him very well for all of those years that he was out there batting for regional Australia. He was a great man, he was a great Australian and I was very fortunate to have known him. I shall miss him very much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  Tonight I rise to speak on an event called Hopak in the Park, which I attended at Melbourne's Sidney Myer Music Bowl in April. The event was organised by the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, or AFUO. I had the privilege of speaking on behalf of the government at this event, and I was also attending in my new role as chair of the Australia-Ukraine Federal Parliamentary Group. The inaugural Hopak in the Park, a dance spectacular, was an opportunity to celebrate Ukrainian culture and the relationship between Ukraine and Australia. Over 300 participants from bands and dance groups from across Australia were enthusiastic to showcase their dance, music and costumes in the traditional Ukrainian way. Participants included second-, third- and even fourth-generation Ukrainians who are dedicated to Australia but still remain true to their Ukrainian origins. The Australian participants were joined by HRIM, a Ukrainian band from New York, and it was wonderful to have an international act as part of the event. I have a close association with Ukraine, as my husband, Robert, who attended the event with me, is of Ukrainian descent. This has led me to take a strong interest in Ukraine and its culture, although I have not yet had the pleasure of visiting the country. Hopak in the Park is a cultural event of national significance. It is a chance for Ukrainians in Australia to share their culture with each other and the broader community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's multicultural policy supports the rights and liberties of Australians of all backgrounds to celebrate, practise and maintain their cultural heritage, traditions and language within the law and free from discrimination. However, Australians do not believe just in protecting and maintaining our cultural diversity; we believe in celebrating and embracing it. The celebration of our cultural diversity and our acceptance of migrants as a valued and integral part of our community make me very proud to be an Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to give a bit of brief information about Australia's relationship with the Ukraine. The first permanent Ukrainian settler in Australia was H Donchak, who settled in Brisbane in the 1920s. The 1940s, of course, was an important decade for Ukrainian settlement in Australia, with the arrival of many Ukrainians following World War II, and that included my own father-in-law. April 1949 saw the formation of the first Ukrainian association in South Australia, with other states following later in the year and in 1950, and in June 1950 a representative body for all Ukrainian organisations in Australia was founded. This body was called the Association of Ukrainians in Australia and was renamed the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations in December 1953. According to the latest census, in 2006 there were 13,666 people living in Australia who were born in Ukraine. It is estimated that the Ukrainian community in Australia is somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 strong. Of course, my home state of Tasmania has a small but very important population of Ukrainians and their descendants. All the communities make a very valuable contribution to Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, to get back to Hopak in the Park, it began with the national anthems of Australia and Ukraine. The occasion was also used to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, with the Australian and Ukrainian flags lowered and one minute's silence observed. In my speech on the day, I spoke of the impact Chernobyl had at the time of the disaster and the continuing effects felt by many people today. The high-level summit in Kiev dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident was attended by Australia's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations at Vienna, Michael Potts, who is also the ambassador with responsibility for Ukraine. The Australian government was pleased to sign on to the declaration of the Kiev Summit on Safe and Innovative Use of Nuclear Energy. The anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster and the recent Fukushima disaster in Japan both serve as timely reminders of the importance of nuclear safety. Today Ukraine's nuclear power plant operators follow the inter­nationally agreed nuclear safety standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Australia believes that IAEA standards must be adhered to in the development of any new nuclear power plant, and the Australian government is keen to ensure that the impacts of the Chernobyl disaster are well researched and documented and that all steps possible are taken to prevent future such disasters. On behalf of the Australian government, I extended our sympathy to the families of those that died and our prayers to those that continue to suffer.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take the time tonight to thank the organisers of Hopak in the Park for their efforts in keeping Ukrainian culture alive and vibrant in Australia. As we all know, an event as big as this requires a lot of people with a common goal to work together to make it a success, and it certainly does not happen overnight. Everyone deserves to be congratulated for their hard work and dedication to the event. There are too many people to mention them all, but there are a few I really would like to mention: the two masters of ceremonies, Yuliya Rai and Steven Sikoria; the manager of the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, the Arts Centre, Glen Hirst; and, of course, the performers and backstage people essential to the event going ahead. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations and other organisations concerned with taking a leadership role and encouraging members of Australia's Ukrainian community to be active in community life. I would like to thank them for enriching the experience of Australians by sharing their culture with us. I would also like to thank the sponsors of the event: Myroslaw and Christine Merunovich, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, Karpaty Foundation, the national Lubomyr Sklepkowycz Foundation, the Victorian Multicultural Commission, Adel Bassili from Travelwiz, Dnister Credit Union, Event Management Services, the Foundation of Ukrainian Studies in Australia; the supporters, Muirs Good Guys; and those who donated raffle prizes, including Inter Airlines Consolidated Group, Thai Airways, Travelwiz, the Good Guys Discount Warehouses in Essendon, Portobello Restaurant in Essendon, and North Essendon Lotto in Essendon. Their generosity was much appreciated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to say thank you to the more than 2,000 people who attended the event. I particularly mention Stefan Romaniw OAM for the invitation to attend this fantastic event and the opportunity to speak. I thoroughly enjoyed Hopak in the Park and the hospitality and generosity of Ukrainian people. They are such generous people. As I said, encouraging people to make the most of Australia's multi­culturalism by attending events such as this is really important. I look forward to attending future events. I am sure Hopak in the Park can only get bigger and better over the next few years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are fortunate to live in a nation that provides us with so many opportunities to experience other cultures and we should all make the most of these opportunities.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e4r" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIELDING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader and Whip of the Family First Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  I stand here tonight to raise a matter of public importance about the events that led to a very dark day known as Black Saturday. It is still not easy to talk about the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. Black Saturday was a day where Victoria experienced a number of extreme bushfires that raged and killed 173 men, women and children, traumatised thousands of people and caused massive environmental damage and property loss. Within days, a royal commission was established, which encouraged many people to put off discussion about the events that led to Black Saturday. Now the royal com­mission dust has settled, I believe it is appropriate to be part of the ongoing discussion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that discussion, I have seen evidence that there were advance warnings by two top bushfire experts way back in 2003. They warned that there was a real threat of Victoria experiencing raging, extreme bushfires like we saw in 2009 on Black Saturday. So, six years before Black Saturday, the CFA were forewarned of the real threat of extreme bushfires. They was aware of two expert bushfire reports, known as the Packham report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Bushfire threat to Nillumbik Shire</span>, and the Incoll report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Bushfire planning issues in the Shire of Nillumbik</span>. These two reports predicted that raging, extreme bushfires would engulf Victoria. Indeed, both reports were proven to be accurate some six years later, when Black Saturday occurred in 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Packham report was written by bushfire expert David Packham. Mr Packham is one of the few people in Australia that the BBC in England rings for informed comment on bushfires. The Incoll report was written by Victoria's former Chief Environmental Fire Officer, Rod Incoll, as an independent second opinion to the Packham report. In 2003 the Packham and Incoll reports outlined that if action was not taken to undertake fuel reduction programs, then the resulting fuel loads would lead to extreme bushfires engulfing Victoria, which is what actually occurred on Black Saturday in 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Packham report predicted the fire's intensity, with a front cover photograph showing a 130-metre-high wall of flame at Wandong, just next to Kilmore East, where the bushfire that killed and traumatised so many on Black Saturday actually started. The location, the intensity and the full horror of Black Saturday was predicted by two highly reputable and independent bushfire experts six years earlier. Indeed, what was predicted in the Packham and Incoll reports that were written in 2003 was played out on Black Saturday, showing there was clearly a failure to act appropriately on this expert advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To help demonstrate how accurate the 2003 Packham report was, about a month after Black Saturday a Victorian CFA member from Nillumbik, who had been through the hell of that horrific day, was given a copy of the report. After reading it, I am told he said: 'So what? We all know what happened on Black Saturday. The media has been full of it ever since.' He was then told that the report he was reading, the Packham bushfire report, was not written after Black Saturday but before it—in fact, in 2003, six years before Black Saturday. Apparently he was left speechless and in shock. Then he slowly became angry, with the realisation that no-one had acted on the reports. For him, this was not only a public scandal, it was also personal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Black Saturday royal com­mission was announced, there was hope that finally the public would know that there were two expert reports that predicted, six years earlier, that there was a real risk of bushfires engulfing not only Nillumbik, but also the wider Victorian landscape. Finally, questions could be asked as to why no action was taken to avert the horrific loss of life resulting from Black Saturday. Given the royal commission had very broad terms of reference, there was a high expectation that there would be transparency and therefore accountability on all the issues; that everything and anything would be laid on the table in order to get to the bottom of Black Saturday and how such a terrible tragedy could happen on such a large scale, despite appropriate and timely warning; and, importantly, that the public would realise that Black Saturday would never have happened if the Packham and Incoll reports were properly actioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some members of the community have come to me, questioning why the royal commission did not explore the 2003 Packham and Incoll reports. They are also annoyed that no action was taken on the reports' recommendations, even when Mr Packham had been the first person to raise the alarm bells. David Packham sent an email to several people including a former CFA captain, Ralph Barraclough, at 4.46 am on Thursday, 5 February 2009. Mr Barraclough then widely circulated this email to hundreds of people, including others in high levels of authority dealing with this issue. This was more than 2½ days before Kinglake was burnt to the ground. Mr Packham wrote in his email that next Saturday would be 'the worst that he had ever seen'. His email detailed the size of the devastation that was about to occur two days later on Black Saturday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of those who attended the royal commission have come to me and told me of their dismay that more questions were not asked of the Packham and Incoll reports during the royal commission's hearings and that these reports' recommendations were not implemented, especially given the accuracy of their predictions six years prior to Black Saturday. If the recommendations within the Packham and Incoll reports to reduce the fuel loads in the Nillumbik landscape were acted upon, who knows how many people would still be alive today and how many houses would still be standing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Councillor Belinda Clarkson, from the Victorian Shire of Nillumbik, has shown great courage in seeking answers to why the 2003 Packham and Incoll reports were not acted upon to prevent Black Saturday. Councillor Clarkson has stood up for her community to endeavour to make sure it is protected from future horrific bushfires. She has been fighting to get answers at some personal cost. If it had not been for the support of the Nillumbik Ratepayers Association and the pro bono support of the Melbourne law firm Piper Alderman, Councillor Clarkson's reputation would have been destroyed. It was Councillor Clarkson and her support group, the Nillumbik Ratepayers Association, who commissioned the independent Packham and Incoll bushfire reports back in 2003.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the recommendations of the royal commission, there is real concern that the prescribed burning recommendation does not go far enough. The royal commission's principle bushfire prevention recommendation, No. 56, falls well short of what is required for prescribed burning as it only recommends burns of five per cent plus. This is not enough. Richard Sneeuwjagt, Manager of the Fire Management Services Branch in the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, stated during the royal commission hearings that eight per cent prescribed burning was a much safer figure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Extreme bushfires are not just a rural problem; towns and cities are vulnerable too. Bushfires extending into Hobart in 1967, Canberra in 2003 and Bendigo in 2009 all clearly demonstrated that towns and cities are vulnerable as well. Victoria must learn from the Western Australian experience on bushfire management, because of its broad depth of research, practical knowledge, operational procedures and nil death toll for over 40 years. If the state government of Victoria fails to increase its prescribed burning, then, as the Packham report says, we are 'living on borrowed time'—and sadly it will be only a matter of time before we have another Black Saturday.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Wong:</span>
                  </a>  The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation Determination 2010/D6 is not a proposed measure. Taxation determinations do not alter the existing tax law, but rather set out the Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation of how the existing law works. In a determination, the Commissioner is simply expressing his view of the law enacted by Parliament and he applies accepted principles of statutory interpretation in doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Determinations are not legally binding on taxpayers (that is, they do not create legal obligations under the tax law for them). Once finalised, they are only binding on the Commissioner. Their legal effect is to protect taxpayers who choose to follow the Commissioner's views expressed in them. Taxation determinations have no policy intent, and the government has no involvement in the issuing of taxation determinations. The Commissioner releases draft taxation determinations for public comment before finalising them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many taxation determinations are considered by the ATO's Public Rulings Panel. The Panel advises the Commissioner on the issues proposed to be dealt with in taxation rulings and determinations and is made up of senior ATO officers and external experts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation determinations do not have a revenue impact on the forward estimates because, as far as the law allows, the Commissioner interprets the law consistent with policy intent on which revenue estimates were based. However, they may have a compliance leverage impact by protecting the forward estimates to the extent that revenue is at risk from taxpayers not applying the law properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO is therefore unable to provide an answer to questions (1), (2), (3), (5) (c), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Yes. It is not anticipated that taxpayers will have to change any common practices or systems to comply with the extra clarification provided by this draft Determination as it deals with incidental costs of disposal of shares which are a common element of capital gains tax cost bases and for which taxpayers would have existing systems or practices in place to deal with. The draft Determination does not introduce any new treatment, over and above standard capital gains tax rules, that might require any new or amended practices to comply with the treatment explained in the draft determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (a) Micro enterprises, small and medium enterprises and large business may be affected by this Determination, depending on how they propose to apply the capital gains tax provisions. No specific industries will be affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (b) The normal consultation process for determinations is being followed. The draft Determination was published on www.ato.gov.au on 17 November 2010 and public consultation closed on <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">17 December 2010.</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (d) The Public Rulings Panel provided advice in the development of this draft Determination.</span>

                  </a>  The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation Determination 2010/D10 is not a proposed measure. Taxation determinations do not alter the existing tax law, but rather set out the Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation of how the existing law works. In a determination, the Commissioner is simply expressing his view of the law enacted by Parliament and he applies accepted principles of statutory interpretation in doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Determinations are not legally binding on taxpayers (that is, they do not create legal obligations under the tax law for them). Once finalised, they are only binding on the Commissioner. Their legal effect is to protect taxpayers who choose to follow the Commissioner's views expressed in them. Taxation determinations have no policy intent, and the government has no involvement in the issuing of taxation determinations. The Commissioner releases draft taxation determinations for public comment before finalising them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many taxation determinations are considered by the ATO's Public Rulings Panel. The Panel advises the Commissioner on the issues proposed to be dealt with in taxation rulings and determinations and is made up of senior ATO officers and external experts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation determinations do not have a revenue impact on the forward estimates because, as far as the law allows, the Commissioner interprets the law consistent with policy intent on which revenue estimates were based. However, they may have a compliance leverage impact by protecting the forward estimates to the extent that revenue is at risk from taxpayers not applying the law properly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Yes. This draft Determination explains that taxpayers are able to take steps to ensure that the value of their deemed loans are reduced (possibly to nil) when the loan from the private company to an interposed entity complies with the requirements of section 109N.</span>

The Panel advises the Commissioner on the issues proposed to be dealt with in taxation rulings and determinations and is made up of senior ATO officers and external experts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation determinations do not have a revenue impact on the forward estimates because, as far as the law allows, the Commissioner interprets the law consistent with policy intent on which revenue estimates were based. However, they may have a compliance leverage impact by protecting the forward estimates to the extent that revenue is at risk from taxpayers not applying the law properly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Yes. Taxpayers who have similar structured investments into Australia may re-examine their arrangements in the light of the views expressed in this Determination on the proper application of the current law.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (a) The private equity industry and non-resident investors may be affected if they propose to engage in treaty shopping arrangements with the dominant purpose of avoiding Australian tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (b) The normal consultation process for determinations was followed. The draft Determination issued (as TD 2009/D17) on 16 December 2009, the consultation period ran until 29 January 2010, and the final Determination issued on 1 December 2010. In addition, meetings were held in February 2010 with representatives of the Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia, the Taxation Institute of Australian, the Certified Practicing Accountants of Australia and the Australian Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association Limited. These bodies also provided written submissions on the draft Determination.</span>

                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator Wong:</span>
                  </a>  The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation Determination 2010/21 is not a proposed measure. Taxation determinations do not alter the existing tax law, but rather set out the Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation of how the existing law works. In a determination, the Commissioner is simply expressing his view of the law enacted by Parliament and he applies accepted principles of statutory interpretation in doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Determinations are not legally binding on taxpayers (that is, they do not create legal obligations under the tax law for them). Once finalised, they are only binding on the Commissioner. Their legal effect is to protect taxpayers who choose to follow the Commissioner's views expressed in them. Taxation determinations have no policy intent, and the government has no involvement in the issuing of taxation determinations. The Commissioner releases draft taxation determinations for public comment before finalising them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many taxation determinations are considered by the ATO's Public Rulings Panel. The Panel advises the Commissioner on the issues proposed to be dealt with in taxation rulings and determinations and is made up of senior ATO officers and external experts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation determinations do not have a revenue impact on the forward estimates because, as far as the law allows, the Commissioner interprets the law consistent with policy intent on which revenue estimates were based. However, they may have a compliance leverage impact by protecting the forward estimates to the extent that revenue is at risk from taxpayers not applying the law properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO is therefore unable to provide an answer to questions (1), (2), (3), (5) (c), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Yes. Some taxpayers might currently operate on the basis that profits on the sale of private equity investments will invariably constitute capital gains and be exempt from tax in Australia. Such taxpayers will need to re-examine their own circumstances in light of the view of the law provided in this Determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (a) The private equity industry and non-resident investors will be affected if they operate on the basis that the profit on the sale of their investments will invariably be on capital account and exempt from tax in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (b) The normal consultation process for determinations was followed. The draft Determination issued (as TD 2009/D18) on 16 December 2009, the consultation period ran until 29 January 2010, and the final Determination issued on 1 December 2010. In addition, meetings were held in February 2010 with representatives of the Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia, the Taxation Institute of Australian, the Certified Practicing Accountants of Australia and the Australian Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association Limited. These bodies also provided written submissions on the draft Determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) (d) The Public Rulings Panel provided advice in the development of the draft Determination.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation Ruling 2011/1 is not a proposed measure. Taxation rulings do not alter the existing tax law, but rather set out the Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation of how the existing law works. In a ruling, the Commissioner is simply expressing his view of the law enacted by Parliament and he applies accepted principles of statutory interpretation in doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation rulings are not legally binding on taxpayers (that is, they do not create legal obligations under the tax law for them). Rulings, once finalised, are only binding on the Commissioner. Their legal effect is to protect taxpayers who choose to follow the Commissioner's views expressed in them. Taxation rulings have no policy intent, and the Government has no involvement in the issuing of taxation rulings. The Commissioner releases draft taxation rulings for public comment before finalising them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Most taxation rulings are considered by the ATO's Public Rulings Panel. The Panel advises the Commissioner on the issues proposed to be dealt with in taxation rulings and determinations and is made up of senior ATO officers and external experts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxation rulings do not have a revenue impact on the forward estimates because, as far as the law allows, the Commissioner interprets the law consistent with policy intent on which revenue estimates were based. However, they may have a compliance leverage impact by protecting the forward estimates to the extent that revenue is at risk from taxpayers not applying the law properly. The ATO is therefore unable to provide an answer to questions (1), (2), (3), (5) (c), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).</span>

Manpower Services (Australia) was paid $41.161 million for services from  1 February to 30 June 2010, including transition costs associated with the seven week contract transition period, which commenced in mid December 2009. In addition, Defence Force Recruiting usually recruits a higher number of recruits in the second six months of the financial year than in the first six months, primarily because of the January intakes for the Australian Defence Force Academy and other recruit schools.</span>

              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Defence also endorsed the Network Centric Warfare Integration and Implementation Strategy. Through seven capability integration and implementation imperatives and 28 supporting initiatives, it provides the 'who' and the 'how' (as opposed to the 'what, why and when' provided in the 2009 Network Centric Warfare Roadmap), to develop a networked Force 2030 by outlining how capability integration will be delivered, and who will be responsible for each activity that will contribute to it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The first version of the Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Capability Management Plan 2011-2030 was completed and is being circulated among stakeholders. SATCOM is an integral enabler for network centric warfare. Over the next two years Defence will develop a Strategic Communications Capability Management Plan that, rather than focusing on a bearer (e.g. SATCOM), will take a system view to include all bearers such as SATCOM, High Frequency and terrestrial links.</span>

                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Chief Information Officer Group is managing the Specialist Communications Modernisation Program - Land which seeks to remediate the Deployable Wide Area Network (D-WAN) by conducting a comprehensive technology refresh. The D-WAN is a critical enabler for the provision of networks of various classification levels to the field. Based on improvements to communications technology over the past decade, the remediated D-WAN will be able to leverage external networks such as wireless broadband (for example 3G), Wi-Fi, Hotel Ethernet and Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line. This offers substantial bandwidth increases, improved quality of service and greater flexibility in connection methods, while significantly reducing bearer operating costs. During the subject period, the Requirements Definition Phase was completed, which included the development of Technology Concept Demonstrators and conducted trials using the Technology concept demonstrators to assess whether solutions would be technically feasible, and to confirm the validity of the requirements definition documentation. </span>

The Master Plan will also provide advice to industry on Navy's future requirements in these fields to enable Australian industry to better shape itself to meet Navy's requirements. The Navy Information Warfare Master Plan will be completed and signed by July 2011.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(b)   The requirement to meet frontline demands for increased bandwidth is being addressed through various projects to acquire satellite capabilities and enhanced tactical networks, including data link communications for ADF elements and weapon systems. On the specific matter of increasing bandwidth, Defence was engaged in the following activities from 1 July to 31 December 2010:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(i)   The ADF's information exchange requirements are routinely assessed using the Defence Science and Technology Organisation to model, run and assess results. This modelling provides a good degree of fidelity as to the ADF's bandwidth requirements. The issue is not necessarily one of increasing bandwidth, but increasing the data rate. New technologies and improved information management practices are enabling better use of existing bandwidth. Network optimisation technology was introduced on some strategic communications links into the Middle East Area of Operations, resulting in significant data throughput improvements of up to three times the previous rate. A more expanded use of this technology is being examined.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(vi)   Defence increased its utilisation of commercial bearers (e.g. Telstra Next G) for minor war vessels when operating in vicinity of the Australian coastline, increasing from nine to 15 minor war vessels. This has saved approximately $2.3 million per year in leased commercial satellite costs. The Specialist Communications Modernisation Program - Maritime will enable Navy to more widely implement this capability across an additional 20 platforms which will realise significant additional savings.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">At 1 July and 31 December 2010 Defence Housing Australia (DHA) had no specific staff members responsible for the stated functions. DHA has a Marketing Communication Team, comprised of four staff members. The team is responsible for marketing communication and media campaigns to provide product and service information. There is relatively little day to day media interest in DHA's activities, so an incidental proportion of the team's time is involved in responding to media requests.</span>

Due to the way in which Army allocates funding for Reserve salaries to formations to manage, it is not possible to determine the exact figure for each state without interrogating the exact number of days paraded by each individual within their specific state. The table below is based on a pro-rata apportionment of the expenditure of Reserve salary for the period in question based on the number of Reserve personnel active in each state as at 31 December 2010.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The ATO service standard for processing of credit activity statements (paper and electronic) is 92% within 14 days of receipt in the ATO. Should there be a delay in processing for any reason, interest on the refund amount is payable where the taxpayer has not contributed to the delay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) (a) Not including any confirmed fraudulent GST refund cases, the case that was held the longest by the ATO was 1,093 days. This case related to a GST refund claim lodged in 2008 which the ATO assessed as being a potentially fraudulent claim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the time of this case, potential fraud cases involving GST refunds were managed so that no preliminary contact was made until there was contact from the taxpayer querying the progress of the refund or the matter was prioritised for review or audit in due course. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of verification checks on GST refunds is to ensure that refunds are not released until appropriate as there is a risk in being unable to reclaim the revenue from potentially fraudulent claims. For potentially fraudulent claims the non issue of a refund would necessitate the client to contact the ATO if the refund was legitimate and could be substantiated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) (b) It is acknowledged that this case was not well managed. In this particular case, through a review of aged cases, a letter was finally sent to the taxpayer many months after the receipt of the activity statement, as the taxpayer had not made contact with the ATO. The taxpayer responded to the letter and the refund was issued after a further 231 days due to delays in obtaining requested documents from the taxpayer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This case highlighted the need for changes to procedures to where a letter or phone call is made within 14 days to potentially fraudulent cases. These improvements to work practices have since been instigated by the ATO to avoid unnecessary administrative delays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Data available to the ATO does not enable calculation of the average time it takes to reimburse clients with activity statement refunds. However, ATO service standard performance demonstrates that 98% of activity statements are processed within the 14 day standard. Once the activity statements are processed, credits are generally refunded within three business days unless there are reasons for the ATO to hold the refund.</span>
              </p>

The draft SAR proposes that GGAPs for individual LNG facilities will be required to evaluate the feasibility of a range of options to reduce greenhouse emissions, including geosequestration.  </span>

                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A combination of radioisotopes made in research reactors, such as OPAL, and those made in cyclotrons are required to service all of Australia's nuclear medicine, research and clinical development needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Molybdenum-99 – which decays into technetium-99m, the most widely used isotope in nuclear medicine globally – can only be efficiently produced in a research reactor such as OPAL. Technetium-99m is used to image the brain, thyroid, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, gallbladder, skeleton, blood pool, bone marrow, heart blood pool, salivary glands and detect infection. Approximately 30 million procedures using technetium-99m are performed worldwide each year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Radioisotopes produced in a reactor are not limited to technetium-99m. Other radioisotopes, such as samarium-153 to relieve the pain of bone cancers, yttrium-90 for liver cancer therapy and iodine-131 to treat thyroid cancer, can also only be efficiently and economically produced in a reactor, such as the OPAL research reactor – an iconic part of our landmark infrastructure for research and innovation. Over 80 per cent of the radioisotopes used in medical procedures worldwide come from reactors. Once radioisotopes are produced, in either a reactor or cyclotron, they are processed in a radiopharmaceutical facility, like the production facility at ANSTO Health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In November 2010, the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) published a report examining alternative technologies for the production of technetium-99m. The report indicates that non-reactor technologies are still some time away from fruition, and expresses strong doubts as to whether they could ever substitute for reactor technologies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A copy of the report can be found at: http://www.oecd-nea.org/med-radio/reports/Med-Radio-99Mo-Prod-Tech.pdf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In June 2010, an article entitled: 'The options for the future production of the medical isotope 99Mo' was published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging</span>. It concludes that: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Reactors will therefore remain necessary for the foreseeable future. The best way to secure the supply of <span style="color:gray;">99</span>Mo for the more than 30 million patients each year is to build new research reactors to replace the old ones and to ensure sufficient total production capacity worldwide." </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The government has a strong commitment to Australia's accelerator research and innovation community. ANSTO, the Australian Synchrotron, the Australian National University and the University of Melbourne established the Australian Collaboration for Accelerator Science, which leverages the strategic investment of $85 million we have made.

To this end, on 15 December 2010, ANSTO hosted the first meeting of cyclotron users from across Australia, bringing together 38 people from 9 different universities, hospitals, commercial providers and research institutes for a one day workshop aimed at strengthening partnerships and creating greater collaboration between cyclotron operators dispersed across Australia. It provides an essential forum for the sharing of information and experiences related to the operation of cyclotrons, which will ultimately lead to the more effective exploitation of Australia's national cyclotron infrastructure, increased pre-competitive collaboration, and better and more systematic education and training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the above research initiatives, ANSTO currently manufactures cyclotron-produced radioisotopes for use by Australian patients through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PETNET Australia Pty Limited (trading as PETNET Solutions). The PETNET twin cyclotron facility, located at ANSTO's Lucas Heights campus, produces 18-flurorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) which is used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) medical imaging. 18-FDG enables doctors to detect diseases such as cancer in their earliest stages and precisely monitor treatment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">ANSTO is a partner with Cyclotek (Aust) Pty Ltd, the Melbourne based commercial cyclotron company, and other participants, in the Cooperative Research Centre for Biomedical Imaging Development where a number of new F-18 labelled compounds are under development for future application in health care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">ANSTO also imports cyclotron-produced isotopes, Iodine-123, Thallium-201 and Gallium-67, through ANSTO Health, for supply to the nuclear medicine community on a commercial basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, ANSTO has a balanced and progressive portfolio of reactor-produced (neutron-rich) and cyclotron-produced (proton-rich) radioisotopes, and a growing set of collaborations and partnerships to ensure effective deployment of these radioisotopes in research and clinical settings, as would be expected of our national nuclear science and technology organisation. </span>

                  </a>  asked the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, upon notice, on 8 April 2011:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Given that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has previously advised that it considers that the use of the term 'terrorist' is appropriate in circumstances where someone who engages in a specific form of militant activity which involves 'terrorising' a community (response to question on notice no. 157);</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) Sderot and surrounding areas of Israel have been subjected to thousands of rockets fired from Gaza, with those firing the rockets deliberately targeting civilians, and doubtless, these communities are terrorised by these attacks;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(c) despite this, the ABC routinely refers to the perpetrators as 'militants', a typical example being the 3 January 2011 report headed 'Palestinians injured in Israeli air raid', which states: 'Israeli warplanes have injured two Palestinians in air raids on the Gaza strip after another spate of rockets fired by Palestinian militants';</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(d) the ABC has even substituted the term 'militant' for 'terrorist', the actual term used, when purporting to report the statements of Israeli military spokesmen and sought to justify this on the grounds that its mode of quotation was indirect and not direct:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Can the ABC confirm that describing the Palestinians who fire rockets targeting Israeli civilian communities as 'terrorists' is entirely consistent with its definition of this term.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Can an explanation be provided by the ABC justifying its practice of describing these terrorists as 'militants'.</span>

The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term as: <span style="font-style:italic;">"combative; aggressive, someone engaged in warfare or strife."</span> It may also be appropriate to refer to persons involved as terrorists, if it can be determined that the militant action was intentionally designed to create terror in the community rather than, say, to strike at a particular military target.
