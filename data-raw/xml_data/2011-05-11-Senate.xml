                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  I rise to speak today on the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011. The coalition will not be opposing this bill. The amendments to the Copyright Act have arisen due to some instances where pharmaceutical companies have launched claims of infringement of copyright in their product information documents. The use of copyright infringement has the potential to provide pharmaceutical companies with an extended period of market exclusivity once the patent over that medicine has ended. This has an effect on generic medicines, because the generic medicines industry in Australia provides important competition for medicines once they come off patent. We recognise the important role that generic medicines and their timely introduction into the marketplace play in the healthcare system. We understand the purpose of these amendments, which is basically to ensure that we still have timely introduction of generics into the market and, in turn, increased affordability and access to pharma­ceuticals in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces two specific exemptions to copyright infringement under Australian law. The first exemption is that the use or lodgement of existing product information documents is not a copyright infringement when used to apply to register a medicine under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. This means that, for example, when a pharmaceutical company applies to the TGA for registration of a generic version of a medicine, they will not be infringing copy­right if they submit a draft product informa­tion document that contains text that is similar to the product information already approved for the originator medicine. The second exemption removes copyright infringement to the supply, reproduction, publication, communication or adaptation of the TGA approved product information sheets, provided that the use is for a purpose related to the safe and effective use of the medicine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some consultation with stakeholders, and there have been concerns raised about some potential unintended consequences. One could be the effect on product information publishers—for example, the publication of the reference handbooks that are widely used by practitioners. The issue is what impact the exemption of copyright will have on these reference books. There is also the potential for unintentional infringements to result in the reduction of intellectual property protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that the amendments do not go any further than is necessary to ensure that the TGA continues to have the ability to approve product information sheets that are in similar forms for both the originator and generic brands of the same registered medicine. We will, however, continue to monitor the situation. As I said, there are some concerns, but we believe the bill does provide important exceptions to copyright to protect the timely introduction of generic medicines into the Australian pharmaceutical market. The opposition will not be opposing the bill.</span>

This bill amends the Copyright Act to allow the longstanding practice of the Therapeutic Goods Administ­ration to approve similar product information of prescription medicines regardless of the brand of medicine. The amendments go no further than is absolutely necessary to ensure that this practice can continue, and the government believes that they will restore the appropriate balance between ensuring safe and timely access to medicines and encouraging research and development in the pharmaceutical industry through appropriate protections of intellectual property. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WORTLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>): I rise to address the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. This bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The bill will repeal the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity before their votes are admitted to preliminary scrutiny. It will implement recommendation 2 of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the conduct of the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto. This measure was also one of the government's 2007 election commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A provisional vote is a type of declaration vote that can be cast by an elector at a polling place on polling day. As with all declaration votes, a provisional vote is sealed inside an envelope and on the outside is written the voter's details, including their name, address, date of birth and signature. A provisional vote is cast when the voter's name cannot be found on the certified list, the voter's name is marked off the list as already having voted, the voter is registered as a silent elector or the voter has cast an absent, early or postal vote. Broadly speak­ing, a provisional vote is used when an elector arrives at the polling booth but the official cannot find their name on the electoral roll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of great concern to the Gillard government, which values and indeed nurtures the right of all Australians to vote, that over 27,000 provisional votes were rejected at the 2007 federal election. The total number of provisional votes was 167,500. At the 2010 federal election there were 203,488 provisional votes cast in total and 28,065 of these were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of their identity by the first Friday following the polling day. Further examination by the AEC of the 28,065 provisional vote envelopes rejected because no proof of identity was provided showed that in 12,227 instances the name of the voter was later found on the certified list. This is not surprising if you consider that there can be miscommunication between the voter and polling official or that a simple mistake can be made by the polling official in not finding the voter's name on the certified list. It is unacceptable that at both the 2007 and 2010 elections thousands of provisional votes were rejected in the very preliminary stages of processing because voters did not provide the evidence of identity by the first Friday following polling day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Electoral Commission has also noted that the admission rate for Senate provisional votes fell from 62.23 per cent in 2004 to 25.14 per cent in 2007. It is a sober­ing thought that, if the 2004 provisional vote admission rate prevailed in 2007, an additional 62,186 Senate votes would have been counted in that election. So the votes of 62,000 Australians were not counted in the Senate voting. That is a lot of Australian voters who did not get a say in the new parliament. Their votes were not counted because the current Electoral Act specifies that, if the required evidence of identity is not provided by the deadline, the envelope containing the ballot papers is excluded from preliminary scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why don't Australian voters provide their proof of identity to the AEC so their votes will be counted? There are many reasons why voters do not provide evidence of identity by the deadline and this does not necessarily indicate any attempt to vote fraudulently. Unlike for many of us here, their lives do not revolve around politics. They are working, raising families, paying mortgages, studying and trying to make ends meet. Many people cannot take time off work to find an AEC office and provide their proof of identity. Many would feel that they have done their duty by turning up on election day to vote. It is the current system that has let them down. It is Liberal Party philosophy which has let voters down. The Liberal Party, of course, is the one which abolished the seven-day close of rolls grace period, thereby preventing thousands of young people from getting on to the rolls and being able to vote in 2007. This government is dedicated to removing barriers to electoral participation, to modernising enrolment and electoral processes and to responding to the increased demand for early voting services. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, has shown that he will take any opportunity to oppose democratic reform and to attack Labor's belief in a modern and fair electoral system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in this bill will address the issue of exclusion of otherwise perfectly valid votes from further scrutiny. It is important that amendments are in place for the next by-election, referendum or general election. At present only provisional voters, and no other declaration voter, have to provide evidence of identity in order for their vote to be accepted. This leads to inconsis­tency of treatment of different types of declaration votes. For example, a voter who is eligible to vote and has a provisional vote rejected at preliminary scrutiny only because of failure to provide evidence of identity would have had his or her vote counted if they had instead cast an absent vote, postal vote or pre-poll declaration vote. There is no reason to treat otherwise valid provisional votes differently from other forms of declaration voting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current requirement for provisional voters to show proof of identity by the Friday following the poll was put in place by the Howard government. One could question whether it was for honourable reasons that the Liberal government introduced changes to this legislation. The intent was not to improve the integrity of the electoral roll, but rather, one could guess, to assist the Liberal Party in the 2007 and future elections. Before the Liberal government changed the rules, the logical system of matching signatures was also applied to provisional votes. If an Australian voter applied at the polling booth and signed the outside of the envelope to say he was the person who voted, then AEC officials took this back to the commission and they checked it against the signature of the elector which exists on the original or subsequent enrolment forms held by the AEC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this government seeks to do is to restore that system through this bill because it is blatantly unfair that, as a result of the Howard government, provisional voters are treated differently from those who cast a postal vote or an absentee vote. Why should provisional voters face a greater likelihood of being disenfranchised? Why should they have to jump through more hoops simply to have their votes counted? Those opposite still agree with a requirement that provisional voters jump through hoops to have their vote counted. This is despite the detrimental effect on thousands of provisional voters. On the other hand, I am pleased to say that the Australian Electoral Commission supports the federal govern­ment's repeal of the identity requirement. In its submission to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election and matters related thereto, the Australian Electoral Com­mission recommended that the requirement for production of evidence of identity by provisional voters should be repealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 will ensure all voters who cast declaration votes are once again treated in a fair and equitable way. It will restore the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to its pre-2006 status where the law, custom and established practice accepted the voter's signature as proof of identity. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:49</span>):  I indicate my support for the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. I want to discuss and foreshadow the amendments that I will move in the committee stage. I believe there is nothing more important in a democracy than ensuring that everyone who votes in an election has their vote counted. I state at the outset that I have had lengthy discussions with both sides of the chamber on this bill and, when the bills were introduced in a previous form to today, I spoke to the Australian Electoral Com­mission on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current requirement regarding provisional voting was introduced in 2006 and at the 2007 federal election 167,682 Australians cast a provisional vote. However, of the 32,000 or so voters who were required to provide evidence of identity within five days to make their provisional vote count, only 5,000 turned up at an AEC divisional office to do so. The remaining 27,000 or thereabouts votes were subsequently dest­royed, not read, not counted. Why those voters did not visit their divisional office is anyone's guess. They could have been busy, perhaps they forgot, they may have thought their electorate had already been decided so there was no point, they considered it too hard or, sadly, perhaps they just did not care enough. Who knows?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the argument can be made that if these voters truly wanted to make their votes count they would follow the procedures set in place as advised to them by the AEC divisional officer on polling day, I am inclined to try to remove the onus on the individual so as to allow for as many votes as possible to be counted. It is a democratic right of every individual not only to be able to cast their vote but also to have their vote count. In some ways the contents of the envelope are irrelevant. Even if hypo­thetically all of those 27,000 provisional votes contained donkey votes, the point is that every vote that is cast should be counted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's bill goes some way in addressing that, allowing that the divisional returning officer must check the signature on the envelope against the most recent record available to them to verify the vote. But under this model there may still be some whose votes cannot be verified. For example, a woman who has recently married and accidentally signed her married name signature instead of her maiden name or someone whose handwriting on the envelope is illegible—and I can relate to that. As such, I will be moving an amendment that requires, further to the government's measure, for any provisional votes which are not able to be verified against the electoral database that the divisional returning officer must make all reasonable attempts to contact the voter within three days of the election and give them until the Friday following polling day to provide proof of identity at a divisional office. I believe that this is a good and sensible middle ground that addresses the concerns of both sides while, most importantly, maintaining the integrity of our electoral roll. he right to vote is crucial and I think that everyone in the chamber would agree with us. And the right to have that vote counted is just as crucial. It is up to us as legislators to make it as easy as possible while maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll for Australians to vote. I believe that this amendment I will introduce in the committee stage provides that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to this bill with regard to misleading and deceptive conduct following some of the behaviour in recent elections particularly the South Australian state election just last year. This was quite a disgraceful episode where misrepresentation was made as to the how-to-vote cards that were being circulated, and I think that Senator Fielding has a particular interest in this. I look forward to debating this amend­ment during the second reading stage and I look forward to the passage of this bill.</span>

Electoral reform is always a delicate issue because even the slightest change can have a tremendous effect on the outcome of an election. For this reason, I think that parliament should always approach this issue with great caution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill deals with the identification that is required for provisional voters. It seeks to reverse the changes that were made under the Howard government when the coalition held a majority in the Senate. As a result, the Senate at the time was treated more like a rubber stamp than a house of review. It is important that when changes are made to the electoral system we should keep our eyes on ensuring that the integrity of our political system is not driven by partisan politics. Ensuring a strong democracy goes above and beyond that. However, it would appear to some as if both sides over a period of time have approached this issue and formed their positions on the basis of how many votes they stand to gain or lose on any change. This is not the way we should be deciding changes to the electoral system. Family First's role is to scrutinise the merits of this bill and ensure our electoral system is fair and maintains a high level of integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this case, in looking closely at the bill I can see that there are certainly two legitimate sides to the debate. The coalition argues that by upholding a high standard of proof for provisional voters to prove their identity, it makes the opportunity for fraudulent behaviour less prevalent. The higher the onus of proof you place on a voter to prove their identity, the harder it will be for rorts to occur, and certainly insisting upon photo ID instead of simply comparing the two sets of signatures is a higher onus of proof.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is not the only factor that needs to be considered when looking at this bill, otherwise we would not just require provisional voters to produce photo identi­fication, we would go even further and ask them to produce a number of sources of identification, perhaps, for example, a passport or a driver's licence, just to be sure. Obviously there needs to be a balance between what is necessary and what is reasonable. Just as it is important to ensure that every vote is legitimate, it is also important to ensure that every legitimate vote is counted. Under the current system there are indeed thousands of voters who take the time to go to the polling booths but who do not end up having their votes counted because they do not satisfy the amended identification requirements under the current legislation. These are people who want their voices heard and deserve to have their voices heard, but they do not happen to take their wallets with them to the polling booth and they now miss out on participating in the democratic process. The question is: is this reasonable or not? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that provisional voters can go to an Australian Electoral Commission office within five days of an election and produce photo ID. But let's face it, how realistic is this option really for many, many Australians? Voting takes time and effort, and plenty of people who turn up to their polling booth and get told that they will have to make another visit in a few days time to show their photo ID simply do not get around to coming back a second time. That ultimately means that their votes get thrown in the bin and do not get counted like everybody else's. I think we would all agree that this is hardly a good result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill seeks to do is restore the system that was in place prior to the 2007 election and require provisional voters to have their signatures confirmed against their signatures on the AEC's records. Family First believes that this will still ensure a high level of integrity of the electoral system whilst at the same time not excluding thousands of legitimate votes. Family First did vote against the Howard government's 2006 bill and we do not support the retention of the existing measures.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  In rising to wind up the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011, I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate. By repealing the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity as a requirement for these votes being included in the count for an election, this bill fulfils the commitment which Labor took to the last two federal elections to reverse the regressive changes made by the Howard government to the Electoral Act in 2006 and thereby to restore fairness to our electoral system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister Gray noted in his second reading speech, this amendment to the Electoral Act is supported by the independent Australian Electoral Com­mission, the AEC. In its submission to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election, the AEC recommended that the requirement for the production of evidence of identity by provisional voters should be repealed. No-one had any doubt in 2006 about why the Howard government brought in the change that this bill seeks to reverse. The respected election commentator Malcolm Mackerras, a former member of the Liberal Party secretariat, said that they were motivated solely by a 'relentless pursuit of the electoral interests of the Liberal Party'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of those changes was to make it harder for Australians to enrol to vote and harder to cast their votes, and that was in fact the coalition's intent. The changes were based on the calculation that the majority of the people who would lose their vote would come from those social groups more likely to vote Labor: first-time voters, new citizens, Indigenous Australians, people with poor English or low literacy skills, itinerant workers and the homeless. Professor Brian Costar of Swinburne University in Melbourne, one of Australia's more respected political scientists, told the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">We know that provisional voters ... are not a mirror image of the electorate as a whole. They tend to be more Labor and Green than they are Liberal, National, or anything else.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the 2010 general election, over 28,000 provisional votes were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the deadline. The AEC found that most of these people were actually correctly enrolled. They lost their vote purely because they did not supply photo ID as required by that 2006 coalition amendment. The coalition claimed that these amendments were necessary to maintain the integrity of the electoral roll. They maintained this claim, and presumably they are still maintaining it today, despite the fact that there is no evidence to support the assertion that any such threat exists. The Senate does not have to take my word for it on this point. Let me quote what the AEC said in its submission to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2007 federal election. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it can be clearly stated, in relation to false identities, that there has never been any evidence of widespread or organised enrolment fraud in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is actually quite a conservative statement. In fact, there is no evidence of any organised enrolment fraud in federal elections in Australia at all. So we are moving to repeal the Howard government's 2006 amendments because they were partisan in their intent, because the justification for them was spurious and unsupported by any evidence and because they have been harmful in their effects.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are in respect of provisional votes. In my second reading debate contribution I outlined the nature of the problem. Under the government's bill, signatures of provisional votes will be verified against the electoral database and where the divisional returning officer is satisfied that the signature is accurate that vote is counted. But there may still be some which are not able to be verified for whatever reason. These amendments address those cases, requiring that for those signatures which were not able to be verified the divisional returning officer must make all reasonable attempts to contact the elector within three days of polling day to require them to provide evidence of their identity by the first Friday following the election. The amendments aim to ensure that as many votes as can be counted are counted. It is a halfway house between the government's position and the opposition's position. I think that it is fair, though, in the circumstances to deal with the nub of the problem. I am grateful for the discussions I have had with the Special Minister of State and the shadow special minister of state in relation to this and I look forward to the support of both sides for these amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to casting a vote Australians should be provided with as much truthful and accurate information as possible in the lead-up to polling day and on polling day itself, which is when many voters make their decision on who they will vote for. At last year's South Australian  state election, in four key seats Labor party volunteers donned blue T-shirts and handed out how-to-vote cards that read 'Put Your Family First', adding 'and send your preferences to Labor' in smaller print. The Family First candidate was listed in the top spot but then the Labor candidate second without party affiliations. It was clearly intended to lure Family First voters to vote for Labor. That should not be allowed to be repeated, given that Family First gave their preferences to the Liberal Party in their official how-to-vote cards. That is not casting a judgment; it is a question of what was the party intending to do. Clearly, it was misleading in that they were not officially endorsed by Family First.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, sadly, was not an isolated incident. In the 2006 Victorian election the Liberal Party had handed out how-to-vote cards that resembled the Greens' how-to-vote cards. The amendments will make it an offence for any person to engage in or authorise another person to engage in any conduct which is misleading during an election campaign. The current act is inadequate in dealing with this issue. It states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) A person shall not, during the relevant period in relation to an election under this Act, print, publish or distribute, or cause, permit or authorise to be printed, published or distributed, any matter or thing that is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it does not include the potentially misleading T-shirts worn by Labor Party vol­unteers who handed out how-to-vote cards that read 'Put Your Family First" at the 2010 state election. Many Australians make their final decision on who to vote for at an election as they walk towards the school hall polling station, and having handed out how-to-vote cards myself I can attest to that. The information they collect on the way can make up their mind. That is why it is crucial that any representations to them are truthful and accurate, and the amendments will en­sure that.  note that both the Special Minister of State and the shadow special minister of state say that this is more appropriate. This matter ought to be the subject of a specific reference to an inquiry by JSCEM, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I would be grateful, in the absence of support for this amendment, to obtain confirmation by both the government and the opposition that it is their intention to do so.</span>

In our view, the amendments proposed do not address the fundamental issue of what is the appropriate regulation of misleading and deceptive electoral advertising and related conduct. The government has agreed to examine this issue and to work with the Greens and the Independents to bring forward appropriate regulation in the area that is colloquially known as 'truth in electoral advertising'. The proposed amendments incorporate the existing legal test contained in subsection 329(1) of the Electoral Act, which is:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This test has been limited by various court decisions and has also been criticised due to its limited operation. In the government's view, it is premature to consider the amendment without the full consideration of whether a wider legal test should be adopted and included in the Electoral Act. On that basis, the government does not support the amendments.</span>

The opposition was happy to support Senator Xenophon's previous amendments. Although we are not supportive of this bill, we did think that, if this bill were to pass, his earlier amendments would improve it and lead to a higher standard of proof of identification. But in relation to the amendments on sheet 7072 there are questions as to the extent to which the concept of misleading and deceptive conduct which may be appropriate in the commercial sphere is applied in what you might call the political sphere—the area of the contest of ideas. It does have an application, but the extent to which that should be applied is, I think, an open question.</span>

                    </a>  I am not aware of that case, Senator. But, as Senator Xenophon pointed out, we do all recall the Labor Party booth workers dressed as Family First booth workers. They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and I know that is true in a policy sense but I do not think it is true when it comes to booth workers, their appearance and the material that they hand out. That was an outrageous instance, and it is appropriate that Senator Xenophon raised it and sought to find a way to address it. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is currently reviewing the 2010 election, and this matter among others is currently being considered. We think that is the appropriate place for that to happen. I know that Senator Xenophon has been in discussions with the shadow special minister of state about ways that that might be further examined, but we think that it is premature at this stage to seek to go further in expanding the use of the concept of misleading and deceptive conduct in the political arena. We therefore will not be supporting the amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  I rise to briefly put some observations on behalf of the Australian Greens. I think these are very important amendments that Senator Xenophon has moved. Like him, I am surprised at the bipartisan consensus from the two old parties that the situation certainly needs a bit of a look at at some stage by somebody, and in the meantime they will be combining their numbers to vote this amendment down. I think it is, to go specifically to the matter that Senator Xenophon is seeking to address here around deceptive behaviour and deceptive conduct on polling day, because the kinds of sordid tactics that we have seen deployed against Family First, against the Independents or, on more occasions than I can remember, against the Greens largely benefit one major party or another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the way that our preferencing system works, you can dress up as a Greens booth worker, hand out a piece of paper that says, 'By all means, vote one Greens, and then go ahead and direct your preference to one of the major parties or another.' That is just one example of highly deceptive conduct that has been seen more times than I can remember at polling booths on polling day. That kind of conduct, whether it is organised by the major parties or not, ultimately acts to funnel preferences away from those whom electors and voters think they are voting for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have long supported legislation to ensure truth in political advertising—to take a broader view of the matter—and this is one of the issues that Senator Bob Brown put on the agenda as part of the Australian Greens' agreement with Prime Minister Gillard last August allowing her to form government. Truth in political advertising was very much on that agenda as a way of improving the integrity of our political process. We conceive of that agenda, I suppose, some­what more broadly, so this is a very important component of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that legislation to impose controls on political advertising and, in particular, penalties for breaches would enforce higher standards, would improve accountability, would promote fairness in political campaigning and would improve the health of our political system generally. There is conduct that you could not engage in in a commercial sense without falling foul of the Trade Practices Act. For some reason we allow in our political discourse that which would absolutely be illegal if companies engaged in those kinds of practices. People seeking to influence our electoral system, the bedrock of our democracy here in Australia, can get away with it with impunity, so this is a matter that is under active discussion by the Australian Greens at the moment with the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until these matters are set to rest, we will continue to propose amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to make it an offence to publish or distribute, for example, an electoral advertisement which is intended to affect voting in an election that contains a statement purporting to be fact that is inaccurate or misleading. he current provisions in the Electoral Act only extend to statements which are intended to affect the casting of votes; and, of course, as we have seen in the past these provisions have been interpreted very narrowly to apply only to how a voter marks out their ballot paper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that the Greens have set out would have extended the truth in political advertising provisions to apply more broadly to all statements or advertisements which are intended or likely to affect voting in an election, not merely on polling day. If the Electoral Commission is satisfied that an electoral advertisement contains inaccurate or misleading materials it may request the advertiser to either withdraw the advertisement or to publish a retraction. That needs to be timely; there is not a great deal of point in having these disputes heard after polling day, by which time it simply does not matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Elections are an opportunity for political accountability, and it is extremely critical that representations are accurate and honest. I would have thought that particularly people in this chamber would have an affinity for that. Under the current system it is entirely possible for advertising that contains misrepresentation and outright false statements to go unchallenged and without penalty. There is no real formal avenue for recourse, and the Electoral Commission is actually prevented from it—it is not through a lack of will, it is simply outside their mandate. It is not something they are able to do</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, of course, can be particularly damaging in cases where the advertisements are presented by third parties, which under the current system are not required to identify themselves and therefore make known their own political or ideological position. The Australian Greens have had quite a long history of attacks by third parties who are extraordinarily difficult to identify. You then follow the chain of accountability back, which can take years, to discover exactly who it is who is running misleading, deceptive or outright false advertising in relation to the Greens in an attempt to influence the political system. This is, again, something that we would find simply unacceptable in commercial advertising or discourse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although such legislation was enacted briefly in Commonwealth law between 1983 and 1984, it was repealed with the support of both major parties. Opposition to such legislation relies on the argument that it infringes the right of free political communication. I hope that that is an argument that we can set to rest. Truth in political advertising legislation introduced in South Australia in 1985 was found to be constitutionally valid by the High Court. South Australia's legislation does not ban all untruths in advertising, but it relates to inaccurate statements of fact rather than opinions that are found to be untrue. So, at least, there is some recourse there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens advocate an amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to make it an offence to authorise or publish an advertisement purporting to be a statement of fact when the statement is inaccurate and misleading to a material extent. This is similar to legislation that was introduced in South Australia. Of course, as I have indicated, in the agreement signed between the Greens and the government last September it was agreed that the parties will work together with other parliamentarians to create a truth in advertising offence in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I would be interested to hear, if either of the major parties care to offer their views on that, as to whether such a proposal has the support of the major parties because I think it goes to the foundation of the way the political debate is conducted in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Senator Xenophon for bringing this amendment forward. I think it is a great shame that the major parties have again ducked the opportunity to engage frankly with it, and to at least advance the debate in one important sense.</span>

                    </a>  I think I was praising Senator Feeney then. But these are important issues; I would have thought we could have dealt with this here and now. It is unfortunate that the government will not take that view. But notwithstanding that, could Senator Feeney indicate on behalf of the government a time frame for this issue and broader issues of truth in advertising and electoral advertising being dealt with? Given the value and the role which the Greens have had in relation to this debate, I think it is important and that this is something that we need to deal with. Otherwise I think you will continue to see a greater degree of the disengagement, disenchantment and cyni­cism which the Australian public has with the electoral process, unless we clean these things up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, in the progress of this matter I am advised that pursuant to the government's arrangements with the Greens these matters are to be discussed and to reach finality by October of this year. From the government's perspective, the Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity has carriage of these matters, obviously, and is charged with the task of negotiating these matters with the Greens with a view to those discussions concluding in October.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just also briefly respond to some of the remarks made by Senator Ludlam. In their contribution to the debate today the Greens raised a range of issues. My point would be that in the government's view none of those issues—while all virtuous of themselves—are advanced by the amendment proposed by Senator Xenophon. That, of course, is the critical point. Our view is that Senator Xenophon's amendment does not advance at all, in particular, as a matter of law. enator Xenophon's amend­ment merely repeats the current test found in section 329, which is a test which, as you said yourself in your remarks, has been read down by the courts so as to limit this to the actual fact of marking a ballot paper. Really, so long as that is the case, I do not think Senator Xenophon's amendment provides you with relief on those various questions that you highlighted in your remarks. So I guess, in that vein, the government continues to oppose these amendments, not least of all because they are of no practical effect.</span>

To say that these amendments are of no practical effect is not right, and I think we need to correct the record in relation to that. These amendments are of practical effect in the context of the mischief that occurred at the 2010 South Australian state election, because what occurred there is something that could occur here at a federal level.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And you have a situation where you can give your first preference to a particular party but it then goes straight to a party or a candidate that it was not intended to on the official voting sheet for that party, on the ticket that has been lodged or in the preference arrangements that have been made. So it would deal with that mischief. I agree that there needs to be broader reform, but this is a particularly egregious and outrageous abuse where it seems that state and federal laws, at least in South Australia, cannot deal with it and our federal legislation is ambiguous, and this would have cleared that up. So, as much as I have a very high regard for Senator Feeney—and I do—I think that, in this case, to say that this would not be of any practical effect is simply wrong on the law. But I understand that this is something that will be the subject of a broader review, and I hope that we can deal with it substantively in the next few months.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I rise in this debate to raise a few other concerns. I understand Senator Xenophon's very legitimate concern about what happened with him in the last federal election. He has presented those matters to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I think he has a legitimate complaint about people trying to claim his title, his name and the first letter of his surname, which seems to be his particular brand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the concern that Senator Xenophon raises is—we do tend to come back to the conduct of the Labor Party over and over again in this—with respect to the 2010 state election in South Australia. This would not necessarily have stopped what happened at the polling booths, with people, effectively, representing themselves as aligned to Family First. The truth is that if it happens on polling day there is very little opportunity to stop it quickly.</span>

                    </a>  I understand, but I do not necessarily think it stops the problem as it happens. There may be a penalty or a fine levied later on, but it does not actually stop the problem. There are pretty strong laws, for example, in Queensland, which were all exposed during the Shepherdson inquiry, about enrolling at the right place and not having a dozen people enrolled at one house. But the threat of imprisonment did not stop the misbehaviour. So I hasten to say that this does not necessarily prevent misbehaviour; it may actually seek to punish it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a bigger issue here: whether or not there should be a truth in advertising test in political debate. I am quite hesitant about this. I have seen this operate in other forums. I have seen this operate in voluntary organisations and non-government organisa­tions. I do not know if the Trade Practices Act 1974 is the best example for us to use on this. Senator Xenophon and I have had long discussions about the accessibility to smaller players of what was formerly known as the Trade Practices Act as well as competition law for them to enforce their legal rights. It is clear there are problems in that space. I do not know if that is the path we necessarily want to go down with political debate. I do not know if that is the test we want to apply, because it does not really help the smaller player.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is actually a bigger issue: do we actually want to see an increasing legalisation of our political processes? A lot of the claims made in political advertising and political debate are contestable. Do we necessarily want a tribunal determining which particular claims are legitimate and which are not? I have said this before about issues of automatic enrolment. I think the AEC in Australia has a fine reputation. I do not want to see the AEC drawn further into political debate. If we say there is going to be any role for the AEC in determining truth in political advertising, the AEC will then lose some of its quite legitimate sheen as an independent agency that runs elections. Its conduct will then become the subject of political debate in the hottest environment possible: the midst of a federal election campaign. Quite frankly, that is not something that I think we should aspire for the AEC to do. The AEC is looked at around the world. Do we want to see our com­mission—I am not trying to necessarily paint this as the ultimate outcome, but it is a possible outcome—being looked at in the context of the way we might look at the conduct of some elections in other countries, where the agencies that run them are seen to be players in the debate, where the completely objective enforcement of the rules is not something that is alleged by one side or the other to be done unfairly? If we draw the AEC into ruling which claims are legitimate and which claims are not then I put to you that that is absolutely inevitable, and I do not think that is something we should aspire to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether or not the Greens make a claim about a policy on climate change leading to the sea levels rising 50 meters in 10 years, whether or not the Labor Party makes a claim about the impact of Work Choices or whether we make a claim about the level of debt and its impact upon future Australians, I do not want those things to be determined legally. They are not questions that should be determined as if there is an absolute truth. Whether or not we used a question mark, a comma or an exclamation mark in the appropriate place, whether the footnote was big enough, the conduct of our elections will come down to legal technicalities and whether or not we have qualified a statement properly. Does anyone think we need political debate in this country to be more qualified, that we need to have fewer statements that are short, sharp and active?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that many of the statements we make in political campaigns are conclusions we have drawn from the evidence. The reason I sit in a different part of the chamber from where Senator Ludlam, Senator Xenophon and Senator Feeney sit is that we draw different conclusions from the evidence before us. That is political debate. So, on a philosophical or principled level, I think that we will be drawing the AEC in, potentially risking its reputation and trying to apply a legal test to a situation that we consciously give to the people to determine. If it came to referenda after these amendments were passed, Senator Xenophon, I think the situation would be even more risky, because if we go back through 100 years of debate over referenda and consider the effect of changing half a dozen words in the Constitution I venture to say that I, as a relatively well-known fed­eralist, would draw very different conclusions to the conclusions that other people in this chamber would draw.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Did anyone think in 1944, when we added a few words in the Constitution to deal with social security and benefits for students, that we would necessarily have said that in 60 or 70 years the Commonwealth will be the sole funder and regulator of universities in this country? Let us go back to 1944. I do not think we would then have been able to predict the future well enough to be able to say: 'There's no basis for you to make that allegation. There's no basis whatsoever for you to come to that conclusion. That's misleading people about the impact of this particular referendum.' Yet that is where we are today. I am not saying I would have made that prediction—I do not have that level of foresight on all things—but the point there is that that is something for the people to determine; it is not something for lawyers to determine and it is not something for the front pages of the newspapers of our country or for the television news to be leading with every night.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do we really want our election campaigns to be accompanied by 'In the latest hearing before the AEC about the latest ad that the Labor Party or Liberal Party put up against one another, the finding has been as follows'? I say to you that I think they will if these amendments are passed. Senator Ludlam, I know the Greens have long campaigned on this, but I am a big fan of the bumper stickers that say 'A vote for the Greens is a vote for Labor'. Would you allege that that is misleading people? I know some Greens who have said to me, 'That's misleading.' I say it is not.</span>

                    </a>  Are you going to seek to ban that from political debate? If it is misleading people and we have clauses such as this in the Electoral Act, what will happen is that those claims will be subject to some sort of adjudication by someone other than the people—that is, the people at the ballot box—whom we intend them to be subject to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I do understand that some who propose or support these amendments are motivated by the right reasons, I respectfully submit that they do not understand the consequences. The consequences will be in the conduct of political debate, which will lead to even more qualified language, more qualified statements and more jargon that our people can understand less than they can understand today's debate. Also, institutions which run our elections very effectively will potentially be drawn into political debate, and their reputations may be tarnished. So in a broader sense I think it is important to outline why there are some philosophical objections to the proposed amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I will be brief. I think I must be doing something right, because both Senator Feeney from the government and Senator Ryan from the opposition have completely mischaracterised and misrepresented my amendments. Let us put this in perspective. These amendments relate to misleading conduct at polling booths where people get dressed up and say that they are representing Family First, another minor party or another Independent and then hand out how-to-vote cards when in fact they have nothing to do with the organisation. There were volunteers dressed up as Family First spruikers when in fact they were Labor Party stooges or volunteers.</span>

                    </a>  He agrees with me on that. There were also Liberals for Forests, as Senator Joyce points out. These amendments deal with that mischief. If passed, they would mean that, on polling day, somebody would not be able to dress up and try to hand you a how-to-vote card that said 'Put your Family First' or 'Vote Greens' or  'Liberals for Forests' or 'True blue Labor'. They would not be able to hand out a how-to-vote card for an organisation very different from the organisation that appeared to be represented.</span>

They do not raise the broader philosophical issues that Senator Ryan was very much entitled to raise and that I think will be the subject of further debate. The numbers are not here, but let us make it clear that this amendment was quite narrowly focused to deal with the mischief that occurred at the 2010 South Australian state election when the Labor Party's campaign—which Senator Feeney had nothing to do with because he was the architect of the stunning 2006 campaign—</span>

These are focused amendments to deal with a wrong that occurred in South Australia on the state election day in March 2010. I think the numbers are not here, but this is something that needs to be dealt with eventually. I do not think that the amendments will cause the problems that Senator Ryan is concerned about, because they are quite narrowly focused, but that is another debate—a debate about truth in advertising.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I do not propose to detain the chamber for long on this issue, but I do want to clarify one or two issues that were raised, particularly those raised by Senator Feeney. I acknowledge, though perhaps I did not do so strongly enough in my remarks, that I was deliberately providing some context for the views that I raised on Senator Xenophon's amendments. I quite freely acknowledge that the scope of these amendments is much narrower than the range of issues that I addressed, and I merely wanted to put on the record that this is something that we have long had a view on, not just because we have had many of these tactics deployed against us but also because they are in fact fundamental to the way that democratic debate is conducted in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I apologise to Senator Xenophon for perhaps steering the conversation away from the direction in which his amendment intended it to go. I enjoyed Senator Ryan's contribution. I think that is precisely the kind of debate that we are trying to provoke here, and again I would raise the parallel with the way that we conduct debates and disputes in the trade practices realm. It is not currently lawful in this country—or, at least, it can be contested and disputed whether it is lawful—to lie and deliberately try to deceive people in commercial conduct. The matter of where we set the bar as to what constitutes decep­tive conduct is, I think, the interesting con­ver­sation, and the bumper sticker example is a perfect one. That kind of conversation is precisely what we are trying to provoke here, given the severe consequences of deceptive conduct which attempts to change the political future of the country when it is engaged in during election campaigns. I do not think it is appropriate at all that people should have no recourse whatsoever when they are casting their vote if conduct is being engaged in that is blatantly deceptive. enator Xenophon has raised a valuable point here. My comments were simply intended to broaden the debate and to remind senators that there is a great deal of unfinished business hanging over this chamber, includ­ing many of the issues that Senator Ryan raised, such as the independence and impartiality of the Electoral Commissioner as the umpire but particularly the fact that there is really no recourse—there is no backstop at the moment—for conduct engaged in on polling day or sustained, heavy advertising campaigns that are blatantly deceptive. At the moment, regrettably, it is people who shout the loudest who are able to potentially influence voting behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are simply pointing to the fact that this is conduct that needs to be addressed, because it is not as though it is a one-off. In every election that I have been involved in over the last 11 or 12 years, there has been an example you can point to where somebody simply has not been playing fair. Not all of the examples that come to mind would be contestable or appealable under the kinds of mechanisms that we are contem­plating, but at least let us get something in place so that we can debate exactly how high that bar should be set.</span>

I am inspired to do so, seeing that inspiration was taking hold in the chamber just before, to address some of the issues related to Senator Xenophon's specific amendment but also to address some of the broader issues that Senators Ludlam and Ryan have both so eloquently addressed. Senator Xenophon's amendment, as he has highlighted, follows from concerns related to the most recent South Australian election. That 2010 election saw some reprehensible conduct. Elections, sadly, do from time to time. In that instance the Labor Party in South Australia decided that dressing up as Family First volunteers and handing out how-to-vote cards pur­porting to be Family First how-to-vote cards that directed preferences in a manner—</span>

                    </a>  No they didn't. That's outrageous. They did not purport to be Family First cards.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BIRMINGHAM:</span>
                    </a>  They certainly did purport to be Family First how-to-vote cards. They were designed very much, Senator Conroy, to look like Family First how-to-vote cards. Michael Brown, the state secretary of the Labor Party, obviously was very inspired by the decision he made there. I do not know whether he was either Senator Conroy or Senator Feeney's candidate for the national secretary's position. I know Mr Brown was very hopeful of his chances there briefly, but, thankfully, those grubby tactics of the South Australian Labor Party were at least not deployed to the national office of the Labor Party on this occasion when you came around to choosing your own national secretary.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a very grubby act. We had the partners of Labor Party candidates dressed up in Family First T-shirts handing out how-to-vote cards.</span>

                    </a>  No! Was it that blatant?</span>

                    </a>  It was that blatant, Senator Fifield. The partner of the member for Mawson, Mr Bignell, was there in her T-shirt purporting to be a Family First volunteer, handing out how-to-vote cards purporting to be from Family First but directing preferences in totally the opposite way to that which the actual Family First how-to-vote cards directed them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there was a serious issue at play here. It is an issue that has been canvassed by parliamentary committees in the previous federal parliament and, indeed, by the South Australian parliament but also by amend­ments to the act in this place already. We sought to tackle this issue of misleading how-to-vote cards. This, in the end, is the critical aspect here—that a how-to-vote card authorised by Mr Brown, the Labor Party state secretary, was directing preferences very clearly in a way that the party which it looked like they came from did not wish those preferences to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have sought to address that here by making clear changes to the Electoral Act that ensure future how-to-vote cards must match up with those from the party of the authorising person. Those changes were passed prior to the federal election. Senator Xenophon obviously believes those changes did not go far enough, but I think it is important to note that the changes we made were what should be done in our very fair, robust electoral system in this country. That is where we identify problems. We should narrow in on the problem and try to solve that problem, not broaden it and create potential unforeseen implications by proposing far wider solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the concern with the amendment that Senator Xenophon has proposed. Yes, he is right, in a sense, that this amendment is narrow at the point of application in that it relates to the point at which a vote is cast; but it is broad as to the potential arguments that could be mounted around it. The notion of misleading and deceptive conduct at the polling booth is potentially far, far broader than the instance in South Australia with the written material of a how-to-vote card, which we have attempted to rectify through other changes to the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would argue that this amendment would have potentially far more sweeping implications than the changes which we have already made that sought to address the particular problem that was identified. Whilst the intention behind this amend­ment—the desire to knock out misleading and deceptive conduct at polling booths—is sound, the potential arguments that could occur around that are very broad indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think about the many, many thousands of Australian volunteers—volunteers for the most part—who give their time on polling day to stand at polling booths to attempt to encourage people to exercise their vote in a certain way, in most instances it all occurs in a very friendly manner. In most instances, the volunteers get along quite well and some unique and strange friendships are forged. But, from time to time, people cross a line in the way they behave at those booths. But, in crossing the line, it is very hard to argue where that line is drawn. It is very hard to judge the throw­away comments someone may make or the discussion they may have with a voter as they are entering the polling booth. hese sorts of comments could all be captured by this amendment, and that is why it is, I think, a step too far in relation to tackling a particular problem—of misleading how-to-vote cards and misleading information given at the polling booth—that the parliament has already sought to tackle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make some comments more broadly on Senator Ludlam's second issue, in relation to truth in conduct of elections, truth in advertising at elections and those general principles. There is probably very little I can add to the very sound arguments of my colleague Senator Ryan in this regard, but once again there seems to be a South Australian element or flavour that comes to this debate. Senator Ludlam has held up the truth-in-advertising standards of the South Australian electoral laws as a potential model for future debate in this place. Much as I would love, as a South Australian senator, to stand here and try to convince the Senate that the standard of conduct of elections in South Australia, the standard of debate during elections in South Australia, the quality of that debate and indeed the honesty and integrity in that debate are somehow greater than in federal elections or in any other state, I would, I fear, be guilty of misleading the Senate were I to make such claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those laws have stood in South Australia for quite some time now. I have worked on numerous campaigns under them, and can I say they are little more than a pain in the proverbial for all to deal with rather than anything that actually promotes or delivers a higher standard of political debate or conduct. Unfortunately, though once again they were put in place with good intentions, the reality is that they have delivered very little. The examples that Senator Ryan highlighted and the issues that he highlighted of the Electoral Commission becoming the arbiter of what is fact, what is not fact, what is misleading, what is not misleading, what is deceptive and what is not deceptive are indeed exactly what happens under the South Australian provisions. My entire job in one election campaign, for the last two weeks of that campaign, was to write letters to the South Australian Electoral Commissioner either alleging misleading behaviour in Labor Party material or responding to Labor Party allegations of misleading behaviour in Liberal Party material. That was pretty much the sole thing I did for those two weeks: to draft for our state director the arguments that were put backwards and forwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A large number of those cases were not resolved until after voting day. In almost all of the cases, the arguments were dismissed because, of course, they were all largely politically motivated arguments put by the different parties, and in the end I think there have been but a handful of examples—and there are some examples, but they are but a handful—where parties have been required to undertake corrective action for statements they have made. But, even where they have been required to undertake that corrective action, frankly it has been of little con­sequence. Often the corrective action is masked in a way so as to look like yet another piece of party material, and the actual correction is a bit like the corrections you will sometimes see buried away in newspapers; nobody much notices the correction when it is compared against the initial misleading statement in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would say that in this broader debate we do risk the problems that Senator Ryan highlighted: that we set up independent electoral commissioners as arbiters of political debate. That is something that would be most undesirable in our system. Trying to write these laws and trying to create and instil these principles of truth of political conduct or political advertising is a fine and noble principle, but in practice I do not believe it makes a jot of difference in South Australia. I do not believe that it works there. I do not think that it has broadened or enhanced the standard of our democracy there, and I would be very reluctant to see us set up a similar system at the Commonwealth level that would simply promote the same types of arguments between the parties and see us undergo the same types of wasting of time and resources not just of the political parties but of the Electoral Commission, who would be cast in that role of arbitration. So I would urge caution on that broader issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can return to the particular issue of Senator Xenophon's amendment, in closing I again emphasise that the issue we are talking about here, I believe, was broadly dealt with or specifically dealt with in the amendments passed to the Electoral Act that looked at how-to-vote cards and the structure of those how-to-vote cards. If there are particular things we can do to those amendments to strengthen them, I personally am most open to looking at that and I would hope the coalition would be as well, but I think it is important that, where we tackle those issues, we tackle them with a narrow focus not just on where they are applied but also on where there can be room for argument. I think the amendment proposed by Senator Xenophon unfortunately leaves a very broad scope for argument and for potential incidents at polling booths that we would not seek to be covered to become points of argument. I think that would be an undesirable consequence of the amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010. This bill seeks to make two changes to electoral law that the coalition finds objectionable. The bill also makes two uncontroversial amendments to which the coalition is not opposed. The opposition sees no problem with allowing prisoners to remain enrolled on the electoral roll even if they are not permitted to vote—which is the substance of the first non-controversial amendment. The coalition also has no objections to the second non-controversial amendment, which fixes an anomaly in the Electoral Act to ensure that all provisions of the act apply in the event of a half-Senate election. These two amend­ments are common-sense changes and the coalition does not seek to oppose them. However, the other two changes proposed in this bill are neither sensible nor common sense and the opposition cannot support their passage through this chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first undesirable change proposed in this bill relates to enrolment and the date of the closure of the electoral rolls before an election. The government alleges that this change is designed to make sure that people are not excluded from voting. The government claims that previous amend­ments to the Electoral Act made in 2006—which changed the time of the closure of the electoral law from seven days after the issue of the writs to 8 pm on the day the writs are issued—prevented many people from voting. This claim is pretty simplistic, to say the least. Certainly, the number of new enrolment or changes of address that the AEC dealt with dropped from 520,000 in 2004 to 263,000 in 2007 after the amendments to the Electoral Act were made in 2006.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the amendments were accom­panied by a strong advertising campaign funded by the then government to encourage people to enrol earlier. This is reflected in the fact that fewer people missed the enrolment deadline in 2007 than in 2004. In 2004 168,394 people missed the deadline of seven days after the writs were issued. Yet in 2007, when the deadline fell at 8 pm on the day the writs were issued, only 100,370 people missed the deadline. So we actually saw a drop in the number of people who were unsuccessful in their enrolment because of the deadline when it was moved forward under the 2006 laws.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget, that it is indeed a criminal offence in this country to not be enrolled to vote once you are over the age of 18 years. What other laws are there that, when we break them, lobby groups like GetUp claim we are victims of some right-wing conspiracy of the Howard government? If we do not pay our taxes, no-one goes out on a limb to defend our rights to belatedly get the money to the tax office. If we forget to put on a seatbelt, no-one argues that they were not given enough time to do it up before driving off. In this country we are all bound by legal imperatives. Yet the legal imperative to be enrolled to vote and to have your enrolment record up to date is not sufficient for groups like GetUp. They feel that they need to sort of ride in on a white horse in case anyone has forgotten—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, part of the reason the previous government felt the 2006 amendments to the Electoral Act were necessary was the legitimate concern about the possibility for electoral fraud from high levels of new enrolments after an election has been called. The integrity of the roll can be easily compromised when you have large numbers of people enrolling themselves at the very last minute, after an election has been called, particularly in a marginal seat. That does open the prospect of a compromise of our electoral system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision of the High Court in the case of Rowe v The Electoral Commissioner, which relates to the time of the closure of the electoral rolls, was interesting because the dissenting judges were very strident in their opposition to the decision which declared the 2006 amendments unconstitutional. In particular, Justice Heydon was strongly opposed to the decision. He said of GetUp's actions, in which they deliberately confected late enrolments in order to appeal to the High Court when their enrolments were rejected, and I quote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Spot on! They are very strong words and, in my view, they are entirely accurate. It is not the Electoral Act that disenfranchises a person, but rather a person's unwillingness to take the simple steps required of them by law to maintain an accurate enrolment. It is not the job of the state to be lenient on people who fail to do what is required of them by law and who lose out as a result of their own actions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second objectionable change proposed in this bill relates to the eligibility of some prisoners to vote. Prior to 2006, any prisoner serving a custodial sentence of three years or more was prohibited from voting in federal elections. In 2006, the Electoral Act was amended so as to prevent any prisoner serving a custodial sentence of any length of time from voting. he bill before us today reverts the law on prisoner voting back to the legislation that existed prior to the 2006 amendment, in line with the High Court decision in Roach v the Electoral Commission. The coalition introduced that amendment in 2006 because we believe that people who commit crimes sufficient enough to warrant a prison term should not, while serving that prison term, be entitled to vote and thereby exercise influence on the society whose laws and rules they have disregarded. We believed that in 2006 and we believe that now. People serving prison sentences have committed significant crimes and have proved themselves unwilling to accept the laws that govern this country. As a result, they have forfeited their right to have a say on the governing of this country for the period of their prison sentence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I trust that I do not need to go through an extensive list of the crimes committed by people currently incarcerated in prisons across the nation. These people have broken laws and many have committed truly heinous crimes. Why on earth should our worst criminals be afforded the same voting rights as Australians who live their lives within the bounds of the law?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is contrary to the principles that form one of the foundation stones of the justice system in Australia. We believe that if you refuse to live by the laws of our community, then you lose your right to participate in our community. That is after all why we send criminals to prison. But a prisoner voting in an election necessarily constitutes participation in the community in which they have forfeited their right to participate by committing a crime. The Labor Party is therefore undermining on a fundamental level one of the principles from which we derive our sense of justice in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no compelling reason why this bill should go back to the three-year custodial sentence period as the cut-off point for prisoner voting. It would make much more sense for the cut-off point to be at the one-year mark. Section 44 (ii) of the Constitution states that any person who:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you cannot run for office if you are serving or are going to serve a prison sentence of one year or more. Should this rule not apply to voting eligibility as well? We think it should. The coalition believes there is a compelling case to connect this legislation with this section of the Constitution, and I will be moving amend­ments—which have already been circulated in the chamber—to this bill to that effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments have two key justifications. Firstly, the amendments lower the maximum sentence served for which prisoners may still vote from three years to one year. This would bring the electoral law in to line with Section 44 (ii) of the Constitution, as I outlined before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition believes that connecting this section of the Constitution with the Electoral Act is common sense, as the right to vote is very much linked with the right to run for office and serve as a member of parliament. Indeed, the High Court of Australia, in its majority judgment on the case Roach v Electoral Commissioner, rejected the idea that the right to vote and the right to be elected and serve in parliament are not connected. Secondly, these amendments recognise that many prisoners serving sentences of two or three years have committed significant, often abhorrent crimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, removing someone's ability to vote is significant and should not be done lightly. But some of the crimes committed by people who will serve prison sentences of between one and three years are particularly offensive. Some child sex offenders are sentenced to less than three years in prison. Some perpetrators of extreme physical abuse involving the use of weapons are sentenced to less than three years in prison. Some people who perpetrate horrific violence on other members of our community are sentenced to less than three years in prison. Some people who are convicted of owning and disseminating child pornography are sentenced to less than three years in prison. If this bill goes unamended by the coalition, many of these criminals will be granted the right to vote. I think this is a serious affront to the community's sense of justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People serving prison sentences are doing so because they were unwilling to accept the laws that govern this country. The coalition believes that, as a result of their unwilling­ness, they forfeit their right to have a say on the governing of this country for the period of their prison sentence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked this question previously and I will ask it again: why should some of the worst criminals be afforded the same voting rights as Australians who live their lives within the bounds of the law? This bill is an insult to some of the principles of justice in our community. The reason we build prisons and lock people up in them is because we believe that if you refuse to live by the laws of our community then you lose your right to participate in our community, and voting for your choice of government is certainly part of participating in your community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that the opposition will propose will bring the electoral laws into line with the Constitution in a sensible way. I am sure that most Australians would agree that there are criminals out there whose crimes are so serious that they do not deserve to vote. They do not deserve access to the rights and privileges of Australians who choose to live their lives within the bounds of the laws that govern our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will move these amendments in the committee stage. I put these amendments to the Senate and strongly recommend that they be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has an appalling track record when it comes to trying to tweak electoral laws in their favour. That is why we must always be wary of the motives in legislation. It was not that long ago that there was still a state Labor government in New South Wales where we saw the efforts of the Labor Party there, with the support of the Greens, change the electoral laws in that state to the benefit of those two parties. Indeed, the Labor Party has twice now attempted to change the federal electoral laws in their favour. I refer, of course, to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2010. Despite those opposite constantly complaining about the undue influence of big donations, that bill makes no attempt to regulate the biggest donors in Australian politics—the trade union movement. Why? Because we know where they get their money from. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But back to this bill, the bill in question: this bill makes two entirely unacceptable changes to the electoral laws of this country, and the coalition cannot and will not support either of them. We reject measures that will compromise the integrity of the electoral roll and we reject measures that give criminals the same voting rights as law-abiding Australians. owever, I do encourage senators to consider the amendments that the coalition will put forward in the committee stage as a commonsense way to bring electoral laws into line with the Constitution without rubbishing the principles of justice that we hold dear.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I rise today to also make a contribution to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010. The bill we are debating today makes amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to give effect to two decisions of the High Court of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first decision by the High Court, as part of the Rowe v Electoral Commissioner case, relates to the close of rolls period decided on 6 August 2010. The second decision by the High Court was from the Roach v Electoral Commissioner case and relates to prisoner voting, which was decided on 30 August 2007. The High Court determined in both the Rowe and Roach cases that certain amendments made to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2006 were invalid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision made by the High Court on the Rowe case relates to a purported attempt to decrease the close of rolls period; that is, the cut-off deadline for enrolment after the issue of a writ for an election. The Roach decision by the High Court concerned a purported disqualification of all persons serving a sentence of imprisonment from voting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we are debating today will help restore integrity to the roll by updating the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to reflect the current constitutional position declared by the High Court. The High Court decision means that the Electoral Act 1918 will be amended to restore the close of rolls period to seven days after the date of the writ for a federal election. It will also reinstate the previous disqualification for prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment of three years or longer from voting at a federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also address two matters which were raised as part of an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto. As a member of JSCEM, I am pleased to see that through this piece of legislation and others the govern­ment is implementing a number of the recommendations identified as part of our inquiry into the 2007 federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the legislation we are debating today, we find that recommendation 47 of the JSCEM report is being implemented. Amendments ensure that while prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment of three years or longer will be disqualified from voting they may remain on or be added to the electoral roll, which I believe Senator Fifield has indicated the opposition will be supporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments relating to the close of rolls give effect to recommendation 1 of the JSCEM report, which led to the seven-day rule. The JSCEM report said in recom­mendation 1:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee can see no valid reason why it should be necessary to continue with close of rolls arrangements that serve to disenfranchise electors and that require unsustainable levels of funding to be expended in order to partly mitigate their effect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no evidence that fraudulent activity was reduced as a result of the amendments to the close of rolls. On the contrary, there is no evidence available that indicates systemic fraudulent activity exists. Those opposite will cry foul over the possibility of potential fraud in the electoral system as part of this change to the Electoral Act, but the JSCEM report rebuffs this suggestion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Special Minister for State, the Hon. Gary Gray MP, highlights that a significant number of people were added to the roll before the last election, after the decision by the High Court. He states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The provision seeks to give effect to the second High Court decision, that of Rowe v Electoral Commissioner, a decision which resulted in 57,732 additional Australians being added to the electoral roll. The bill would update the Electoral Act to reflect the current constitutional position as declared by the High Court in the Rowe decision to restore the close of rolls period to seven days after the date of the writ for a federal election or a referendum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />I think it is worth putting on the record in this chamber today that the joint judgment of Justice Gummow and Justice Bell, in part, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... A legislative purpose of preventing ... fraud “before it is able to occur”, where there has not been previous systemic fraud associated with the operation of the seven day period before the changes made by the 2006 Act, does not supply a substantial reason for the practical operation of the 2006 Act in disqualifying large numbers of electors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This means you cannot merely assert fraud but have to show that substantial fraud is occurring before you go down the path of disenfranchising large numbers of electors. The opposition, for many years, has asserted that fraud is happening and they think that somehow the electorate will believe them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes an interpretative provision to ensure that certain references in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to 'an election for a division' or similar expressions can operate in the event of a half-Senate election held independently from an election of the House of Representatives. This addresses an anomaly in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds upon the Labor government's commitment to bring about electoral reform and create a more transparent and robust electoral system. We have a number of pieces of legislation currently before the parliament which those opposite continue to oppose. Those opposite are not really interested in genuine electoral reform; otherwise, they would have already offered bipartisan support for a number of crucial electoral reform bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government is committed to the passage of legislation which brings transparency and accountability back to the electoral system. Under the watch of those opposite, transparency was thrown out of the window and loopholes were exploited. We have moved to tidy up the funding and disclosure system through the political donations and other measures bill, which introduces six measures across three key areas and will increase the transparency of political donations and disclosure, ensure that there is more frequent and timely reporting of political donations and expen­diture and reform the public funding of elections. Overall, this will deliver a more transparent and accountable electoral system, along with the bill we are debating today, which will change the date for the close of rolls to seven days after the issue of the writ and will rectify the previous disqualification of prisoners serving a sentence of imprison­ment of three years or longer from voting at a federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this is an important bill that is necessary to ensure that the Com­monwealth Electoral Act is reflective of the decisions made by the High Court of Australia. It is also important as it returns the seven-day period of the close of rolls after the issuing of the writs. This is funda­mentally important to the government as it is an essential amendment to ensure that the maximum number of Australians are able to have their say in the democratic process and vote in elections. This includes rectifying the previous disqualification of prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment of three years or longer from voting at a federal election. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0Q" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I will not recap the contribution of Senator Fifield on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2011 other than to say I am in support of it, particularly his critique of how we got to this point through the decisions of the High Court and the history of electoral reform in this area. I will not in detail debate the contribution of my predecessor; the issue has been debated many times in this place. But as long as the government refuses to address the single biggest donors to political parties in this country—the very groups that actually control the party that makes up the government—then, quite frankly, its bleating about transparency will never be taken seriously. And it is nothing more than that—contrived bleating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest or imply that there are people on this side of the House that do not want every Australian who has the right to exercise their vote to do so is to mislead this debate. At the same time, to say that it is somehow a burden to have to fill out a simple, DL sized, envelope sized, form to enrol to vote—that it is somehow hard to expect people to comply with that law to exercise their right to vote at polling places open all around the country, through prepoll voting, which is getting more and more common, or through postal voting, which is as easy to access here as anywhere in the world—is to lower the bar for voting so much that it becomes worthless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition opposes the bill. To add to the contribution of Senator Fifield, I would like to discuss how we got here, because I think this is very important. This legislation poses a challenge for this parliament because it is partly—the government probably has a different view, but at least on our side we accept this—the result of High Court decisions in Rowe and Roach. They pose a challenge for this parliament, and I will go into that, but at the outset I will say that I am a strong supporter of judicial review; I always have been. A written constitution requires an authority to expound and enforce it and, in the words of Justice John Marshall, 'we must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding', it is not merely a normal statute. In that great case of Marbury v Madison, which established this point, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If then the courts are to regard the constitution; and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature; the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That may seem a little complex, but it is essentially the clause that established the concept of judicial review as we know it, and it is an important part of our Constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it also poses a challenge. The High Court rightly draws limits around the powers of this place. We have in our Constitution a Commonwealth of limited powers. For a decade it was debated and deliberated upon in great detail by the founding fathers and drafters, who were elected by the people after 1897. These drafters were, I should restate, elected by the people, and the Constitution was in a meaningful sense adopted by the people of Australia at the time voting in referendum—in some cases, on multiple occasions. For those who would put the view that it is merely an act of the Westminster parliament, I point them to the opening clauses of the Constitution, which qualify the position of Western Australia pending the result of a referendum being held in that state. In every meaningful sense, our Constitution was adopted by the people of Australia just over a century ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the constant invitations by those opposite to change the original text, it has remained unchanged. I actually view the failure of referenda proposals put up by this place as a success of democracy rather that something that needs to be addressed. One of its great elements is that our Constitution was made the property of the people by section 128 and it is outside the power of this place to change that—it requires a vote of the people to do so. This legislation directly impacts on that, but it also is a result of the Constitution remaining outside the ambit of this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At referendum after referendum, the people of Australia have voted against constitutional change that centres more power in this place. They have also voted against change that allegedly creates or enshrines certain rights, and they have done so on multiple occasions. Yet, over decades, this parliament has attempted to circumvent those with elaborate constitutional schemes to avoid the protections granted to the people assembled in state parliaments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the High Court, the so-called 'keystone of the federal arch', that was supposed to prevent this, and I do not think anyone would argue seriously that it has failed. In the particular case that I am getting to, we do have the High Court discovering certain 'implied rights', or however they may be described. It has failed to protect the constitutional structure from actions of the Commonwealth parliament and it has failed to protect it from temporary political passions, with notable exceptions—and this is the quandary we now find ourselves in. While the High Court has allowed the contrived constitutional constructs of the uniform tax cases and has seen fit to draw no boundaries around the two words 'external affairs' in section 51 of the Constitution—or, indeed, trading and financial corporations—the High Court has done so on this occasion. It has also, rightly, protected the judicial power from encroachment by the legislative powers. But it has seen fit to intervene in electoral administration. This is not a voting rights case; this is an administrative one. If I turn to the Constitution and the clauses upon which this hangs, section 7 and section 24, we find the important words 'directly chosen by the people'. These are the words that the High Court has used to infer a limit on the Commonwealth power in this place to administer the electoral processes, despite the fact that section 30 outlines that the qualifications of electors stand as they are until the parliament otherwise provides. The Constitution grants these powers to the parliament and we find ourselves in a situation now where the High Court, despite not actually finding any implicit real restrictions on Commonwealth power with respect to its legislative power vis-a-vis the states, has done so on, of all things, whether or not the electoral rolls close and when they do so. In this particular case the High Court's decision, the dissent that was outlined by Senator Fifield and the words of Justice Heydon, where he referred to people being the authors of their own misfortune, may in fact come back to haunt this place, because decisions have actually been known in this place to be changed. That is the basis of the judicial power. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put to you, Acting Deputy President Trood, and to the parliament that the High Court has seen fit to constitutionally intervene in an electoral matter that did no more than exercise the power to administer elections that is implicit in this place and that in fact the words 'directly chosen by the people' do not necessarily constitute a reasonable interpretation of the timing of electoral rolls closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The founders consciously chose to avoid the inclusion of a bill of rights in our Constitution. There are various guarantees scattered that generally limit the power of the Commonwealth throughout it, but it was a conscious decision to not have a section that guaranteed due process or a section that guaranteed voting rights. In fact, one of the founding fathers, Andrew Inglis Clark, promoted this very point and a due process amendment similar to the US 14th amendment, but he did not succeed. Yet our High Court has determined that this one limitation upon Commonwealth power should be discovered; that this one implication, this one implied right, should be discovered about something about the timing of rolls closure—not to do with who is eligible to be on the roll, at least in the Rowe case, but purely about the timing of the closure of rolls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is fine, but we should actually look at the High Court over its century—or 90 years since the Engineers case—and whether it is actually applied the same standard of discovering limitations on Commonwealth power in fulfilling its prime constitutional role, and that is to limit the powers of this place vis-a-vis the states. In this case I will actually quote the words of then Professor Greg Craven, who outlined in his Deakin Lecture in 1997:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The positive, and fundamental role of the High Court was to protect federalism. In this connection, it goes without saying that the Constitution itself breathes federalism, not merely implicitly, but expressly in its very terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reference to decisions that were discovering rights that were literally not written into the Constitution—not all of whose cases I actually oppose—he also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fundamentally, there were two things that the Court was not intended to do. Generically, it was not to be the role of the Court [to] "up-date" the Constitution in light of the passage of time. Secondly, and more specifically, the Court was not intended to operate as a court of human rights, enforcing abstract constitutional guarantees of civic liberties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those two facts are incontrovertible when one looks at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>of our convention debates. We do not rely on the notes of people that were there; we actually have a full record of the committees and of the conventions themselves. I put to you, Acting Deputy President, and to the parliament, that in considering this legislation and how we got here, while we duly respect the decision of the High Court—it has that role in our Constitution—we should also consider whether or not, while it finds implicit limits upon Commonwealth powers in words that do not exist in the Constitution, while it finds implied rights that specifically were not placed in the Constitution by the people who drafted it and then put it to the Australian people for a vote, the High Court, discov­ering these, is failing in its most important duty, the role for which it was created, which was to actually limit the activities of the Commonwealth parliament in those areas with which it was specifically prescribed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition will be moving amend­ments to this legislation to maintain some degree of integrity in our voting system and some degree of fairness in our justice system to ensure that not all those prisoners who necessarily under the Labor Party's model would get to vote will get to vote. They are fair and reasonable amendments.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I will just rise to add some brief remarks on behalf of the Australian Greens on this bill on a day when we have spent quite a bit of time discussing electoral reform. I indicate at the outset that the Australian Greens will be supporting the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The two key issues, obviously, which have been fairly well canvassed in the debate thus far are those around the closing of the rolls. Schedule 1 to the bill addresses the Rowe decision and contains amendments relating to the close of the rolls. This is something on which we have been very strongly on the record since the decision was made by the Howard government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first of the High Court decisions that I will address, as other senators have, is Rowe v Electoral Commissioner as decided on 6 August 2010. That case related to the period of time before the close of rolls allowed for voters to either ensure that they were on the electoral roll or to update their details following the formal issue of a writ for an election. While the High Court has not yet handed down the reasons for its decision, there is sufficient information to amend the legislation to reflect the decision that has been made. This obviously will unto the changes that the Howard government made to the law which resulted in two important deadlines for the close of the rolls: at 8 pm on the day that the writ is issued for people enrolling for the first time or re-enrolling after having been removed from the roll, and at 8 pm on the third working day after the writ was issued for those who are (1) eligible who are currently enrolled but needing to update the details, (2) not enrolled but who will turn 18 between the issue of the writ and polling day and (3) eligible who are not enrolled who are to receive Australian citizenship between the issue of the writ and polling day. These changes were deemed necessary by completely unsubstantiated claims by the coalition government of the day of an untenable administrative burden on the AEC or electoral fraud damaging the integrity of the roll and encouraging voters to leave updating the details with the AEC until the very last minute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember the conduct of that debate quite vividly. It is worth noting that following the 2001 election the AEC conducted an audit in South Australia of address changes in the week from the issuing of the writs to the close of the rolls, and in a roll of one million people no evidence of electoral fraud was uncovered. Elections are not held on fixed dates and they can be called unexpectedly. The Australian Greens would perhaps take a different position on this if you could see a federal election coming three or four years in advance. Then I think perhaps the coalition would have a leg to stand on in this debate. But of course we have not solved that particular issue federally. My colleagues in state parliament in the upper house in WA are looking forward to debating to provide for fixed four-year terms in the Western Australian parliament. At that point you could have a sensible debate about when the rolls should close, either if you were a new voter or if any of the other conditions apply that we are seeking to amend here. ut at the moment in federal politics elections are still called by the Prime Minister of the day for essentially tactical reasons, and it is all about political advantage for the party that has the hand on that particular lever of the issuing of the writs. I think most MPs privately will admit that that is an untenable situation, and that is something I will address in later remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Closing the rolls early effectively disenfranchises voters—and let us be serious, that was the intention of the amendments in the first place—about 80,000 new voters; and particularly it disenfran­chises young people. Senator Fifield's comments very early in the second reading debate—that is, that parliament did not disenfranchise people, people did because they did not respect the law and they did not bother to turn up on time—is extraordinarily disingenuous because this parliament sets the laws and the rules of conduct by which elections are conducted, and then it is up to people to keep track. We may live and breathe politics in this building and the various constituencies that we deal with, but for many other people politics is distant to the point of irrelevance. I think it is partly because of the conduct that is frequently displayed, for example, at question time, where we make a collective mockery of ourselves. The media obviously plays its part as well in the trivialising and politicising of policy debates. That aside, this is one of the reasons why people, particularly first-time voters, might not be sensitively attuned to the way that electoral law changes and the calling of the election is the wake-up call for many, many people, particularly young people—'All right, I'm interested in this debate. This is something I want to participate in. I am entitled to participate and so I'm going to get myself on the electoral roll or make sure that my details are accurate'—at which point they discover that former Prime Minister John Howard has made that impossible on their behalf. Some of the comments that we heard from coalition speakers revealed the gigantic disconnect between the theory and the practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reduction in time for voters on the roll to change their address details created difficulties for about 200,000 people in the instance that I was addressing before. At the last election 62,583 people joined the electoral roll during the seven-day grace period. That was made up of about 16 per cent of the total growth of enrolments since the previous election, and that was partly at the will of the Prime Minister of the day. At the 2004 election 77,231 new electors, many of them young, first-time voters, got on the electoral roll during that seven-day window. Early closure of the rolls impacts disproportionately on younger voters in terms of adequate provision for first-time enrollers and due to the fact that the living arrangements of younger Australians are more likely to change from one election to the next; it is a more mobile population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people are identified as a priority cohort for achieving the AEC target participation rate of 90 per cent of eligible electors being enrolled to vote. That is a good target, it is a healthy target, it is much higher obviously than in jurisdictions where enrolment is not compulsory and it is something that we can be justifiably proud of. It is encouraging participation in the democratic process. I do not believe—Senator Fifield can call me out on this if I am wrong—that any coalition speakers addressed the demographic imbalance of the people who were effectively disenfranchised by the changes that were made by former Prime Minister John Howard, and the fact that young people found themselves disproportionately impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings Australia back into line with international standards: Australia, 8 pm on the day that the writs are issued, a minimum of 33 days before polling day; Canada, it is polling day; New Zealand, it is the day before polling day; the UK, 11 days before polling day. This bill does promote a valuable amendment to the way that elections are run and the way that people can find themselves able to participate or not when the polling day finally comes around. It was a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report on the conduct of the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto</span>. The Australian Greens had planned to move amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2009 in the Senate to repeal the 2006 amendments, and we are therefore happy to support the government in finally taking action on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of prisoner voting, which I will address briefly, schedule 2 to the bill addresses the Roach decision and contains amendments relating to prisoner voting. The second High Court decision that this bill touches on is Roach v Electoral Commissioner, as decided on 30 August 2007, with reasons published on 26 September 2007. This decision relates to the franchise for people who may be serving a sentence of imprisonment. The amendments would ensure that while prisoners who are serving a sentence of imprisonment of three years or longer will be disqualified from voting, they may during this period of disqualification remain on or be added to the electoral roll. Remaining on the roll will ensure that a prisoner who has served his or her sentence does not have to enrol for a second time and will in part assist the prisoner's transition back into Australian society. I understand there are opposition amendments foreshadowed by Senator Fifield to change the three-year term to one year, which the Australian Greens do not support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will turn to other reforms that are not included in this bill, which we can perhaps address during the committee stage, which the Greens also support. Again, as I did during the debate on the earlier electoral reform bill, I would like to provide some context for why the Australian Greens are voting the way that we are on this particular package of legislation and to foreshadow some of the things that we believe still need to change. For example, lowering the voting age to 16 years and making that optional for younger people to be able to vote. You will notice a certain pattern here: that all of the proposals that we put on the table, and these are things that Senator Bob Brown has been championing for many years, encourage democratic participation, encourage political debate by the widest possible diversity of views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Restricting the use of postal voting applications for party political purposes. We have probably all seen examples of this, where the boundary is completely blurred between the kind of independent material that you expect to get from the Electoral Commission and party political material which provides you with the ballot at the same time as telling you how to vote. That would be an extremely valuable reform which is not often spoken of. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Allowing public citizens and dual citizens to stand as candidates in federal elections. Again, widen the franchise for candidates and for voters and broaden participation in our democratic process as much as possible. Adopting fixed terms for federal parliament. It is a long time since this has been seriously looked at. There are vague whiffs of this one that float in and out of the public debate, but it has never been seriously taken on. If any senator in this place would like to provide a rational justification for why the Prime Minister of the day gets to call an election I would be delighted to hear it, because I have not heard a convincing case made for that in the past. ublic funding for elections is an issue that Senator Brown has been championing for many years, as many of us have, as a way of pulling the corrosive influence of corporate funding out of our election process. Public funding for elections provides a platform for the entire diversity and the whole spectrum of political opinion in Australia to take its place at the table and potentially in these debating chambers here in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As senators will obviously be aware, the proportion of the vote in the Australian public is not at all reflected by the proportion of representation in the House. That is one example where the Senate at least shows the way. The proportion of the vote—and I am not saying this because I am on the crossbenches; I think this is something that would be of interest to us all—should as accurately as possible reflect the balance of voting intentions and reflect the will of the popular view. Despite the malapportionment between the states and territories, the Senate still manages to reflect the popular view far more accurately than does the House of Representatives. Proportional representation in the House of Reps is, I think, a serious piece of unfinished business that needs to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that Senator Brown has spent many years campaigning on is optional preferential above the line voting in the Senate to do away once and for all with the backroom preference negotiations and deals that are done by all parties and anybody contesting a political contest in Australia. The kinks and the quirks in the system on many occasions go some way away from reflecting the balance of popular opinion and the balance of political views in the community when preferences are channelled in various directions which people who vote '1' on the ballot paper may not necessarily be aware of unless they are paying very close attention to the Senate ticket. Optional preferential above the line voting in the Senate would go some way towards addressing some of those issues which I think are quite poorly understood in the community and tend to distort the political debate and the tone of debate during election campaigns and become the focus of excessive coverage by media organisations. I am not sure whether that is justified or not, but the fact is that we should take a serious look at anything that distorts the popular will and the will of the voter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not dwell on truth in political advertising because we did canvass that in the early debate. And why not ban how-to-vote cards while we are at it? I have participated on polling day in election after election, and people are simply fatigued by the kind of behaviour that they are subjected to on polling day. Why not take a look at some examples from around the Australian states and, indeed, international experience where everybody is given access to voting material and advice on how to vote but we are not simply dumping thousands of tonnes of paper on people to be used so ephemerally and then discarded. And potentially there is the introduction of electronic voting as well. What can we do to bring our electoral system into the 21st century as a way of broadening the franchise and enabling participation as broadly as possible? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are things which this bill does not touch, but I do not intend to detract from the fact that this is an important reform. It is a reform that is contested by the coalition, which put these distortions into the system in the first place. The government should be congratulated for bringing these measures forward.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0O" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I rise to wind up the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 and I would like to thank all senators who have contri­buted to this debate. This bill does two things. First, it repeals the amendment made to the Electoral Act by the Howard gov­ernment in 2006 which stipulated that the electoral roll must close at 8 pm on the day on which the writs for a federal election are issued. That amendment abolished the traditional seven-day period of grace in which voters could enrol to vote or change their enrolment details after an election was announced. Second, it repeals the Howard government's 2006 amendment which deprived all prisoners serving sentences of full-time imprisonment of the right to vote and returns the law to where it was before 2006, restricting the deprivation of the franchise to prisoners serving a sentence of longer than three years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister Gray, the Special Minister of State, noted in his second reading speech, in both cases the provisions of this bill have been prompted by recent decisions of the High Court of Australia. In 2010 the High Court found in Rowe v Electoral Commissioner that the 2006 amendment abolishing the period of grace for enrolment was invalid. The court's reasoning was that such a restriction on the right to vote contradicted sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution, which provide that the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be directly chosen by the people. The court found that the Howard government's amendments operated as a disqualification of citizens from their constitutional entitlement to vote, without sufficient substantive reason. This decision was in part based on a 2007 case—Roach v Electoral Commissioner—in which the court made a similar finding in relation to the 2006 amendment which excluded prisoners from voting. In that case the court found that, although it was legitimate to deprive prisoners serving long sentences of the franchise, it was an unwarranted restriction of the constitutionally guaranteed right to vote to exclude all prisoners serving custodial sentences from the franchise, since this was applying an arbitrary exclusion not based on any consideration of the severity of the offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two High Court judgments require the parliament to amend the Electoral Act to bring it into conformity with the Con­stitution. But I want to make it clear that the first part of the bill, the part relating to the closing of the rolls on the day the writs are issued, is being brought forward not simply because the High Court decision requires it but because it fulfils a commitment which Labor has taken to the last two federal elections to reverse the regressive changes made to the Electoral Act 2006 by the Howard government and thereby restore fairness to our electoral system. The effect of those changes in 2006 was to make it harder for Australians to vote and harder to cast their votes. The changes were based on the calculation that the majority of people who would lose their vote would come from social groups more likely to vote Labor. Professor Brian Costa, of Swinburne University in Melbourne, one of Australia's most respected political scientists, told the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that provisional voters are not a mirror image of the electorate as a whole. They tend to be more Labor and Green than they are Liberal, National or anything else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition claimed that these amendments were necessary to maintain the integrity of the electoral roll. They still maintain this claim today despite the fact that there is no evidence to support the assertion that any such threat exists. The Senate does not have to take my word for it on this point. Let me quote Emeritus Professor Colin Hughes, a former Australian Electoral Commissioner. At the time Senator Abetz introduced his amendments in 2005 Professor Hughes wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The thorough review of the electoral roll conducted in 2002 by the Australian National Audit Office concluded that, overall, the Australian electoral roll is one of high integrity and can be relied upon for electoral purposes. There are adequate safeguards in the current electoral laws and procedures to deal with any future attempts at fraud without stripping the vote from hundreds of thousands of citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reverses the unjustified and undemocratic amendments made by the Howard government to the Electoral Act in 2006. In doing so, the bill restores fairness and equality of treatment for all voters in our federal elections and referendums. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not propose to talk at length about the opposition's amendments, which were canvassed at length in my earlier contribution. Suffice to say that the coalition is unequivocal in its view that those who have broken the law, those who have been sentenced to more than one year in prison, should forfeit their right to participate in the community by way of casting a ballot at an election. We were very comfortable with the amendments which we introduced when we were in office. Given the government is seeking to change that situation, seeking to reflect in legislation the decision of the High Court, we think that it is appropriate to link the eligibility to vote to the constitutional requirement that someone who has a custodial sentence of more than a year is not eligible to stand for parliament. We think that is an inappropriate linkage to make. I will not go any further on that matter. I have canvassed it at length in my contribution. I commend the opposition amendments to the chamber.</span>

Obviously, in considering the amendments set out on sheet 7044, the government opposes those amendments. We oppose those amendments on the basis that we have received legal advice on the international law aspects of this proposal from the Attorney-General's Department. That advice states that limiting the right to vote in the way envisaged by these opposition amendments would 'not be objective, reasonable or proportionate' according to the standards of international law in this area. That advice concludes that such a ban would be unlikely to comply with Australia's human rights obligations. We think that the formula found in the bill is an appropriate balance between the right of persons to vote and persons in custodial sentences forfeiting that right.</span>

We are not necessarily hostile to the coalition's position, but it is a matter of degree. If you have copped a parking fine, arguably you have broken the law and nobody would seek to remove your franchise there. What the parliament is attempting to do here is identify exactly where that threshold or boundary should lie of having that important citizenship entitlement withdrawn from you if you are subject to a certain term of imprisonment. In this instance we are inclined to support the government for the reasons Senator Feeney has just set out. Question put:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  The Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 arises principally from the govern­ment's response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee's 2008 inquiry into the effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act in eliminating discrim­ina­tion and promoting gender equity. I should say that the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of gender equity has always been a core value of the Liberal Party and it is a value in which we have been pioneers in giving legislative effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report's very broad recommendations were supported in part by the Liberal senators of the committee and the government's response aligned fairly closely with the position taken by Liberal senators. The bill would make four substantive amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act: to extend the act to ensure equal protection for men as well as for women; to broaden the prohibition on discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities to include indirect discrimination to both men and women in all areas of their work; to establish breast­feeding as a separate ground of prohibition of discrimination; and to strengthen the protections against sexual harassment in workplaces and schools to also include cyber bullying and electronic harassment. he amendments to the Age Discrimination Act provide for the establishment of an age discrimination commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. This is intended to reflect the increasing needs of an ageing population and to address the factors that contribute to age discrimination in the workplace and the broader community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate committee reported on 1 March. The majority recommended that the bill be passed as drafted. However, Liberal members of the committee reiterated their dissenting findings in the 2008 report that there was no evidence of systemic discrimination on the basis of family respon­sibilities or circumstances of sexual harassment that are not adequately addressed by the existing legislation; that the combined effect of the proposed amendments relating to family responsibilities and sexual harassment would impose significant com­pliance costs; that the provisions are so drafted as to facilitate vexatious claims; and that there was no need to further extend the powers of the Australian Human Rights Commission. I will return to those grounds of concern in a moment. The Liberal senators supported the amendments relating to the appointment of a new office of age discrimination commissioner; the amend­ment which would give equal coverage to both men and women of the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act; the recognition of breastfeeding as a separate ground of prohibition of discrimination; and the amendments in relation to sexual harassment of students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something in particular in relation to the prohibition of indirect discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities. The coalition takes the existing prohibition of direct discrimination very seriously, and we strongly support it. It is vital that those seeking to make a contribution to society, and especially those seeking to support their families, are not locked out of opportunities because of a misplaced fear that the demands that families place on workers will detract from their effectiveness or commitment. But the amendment proposed by this bill goes much further than that and has the potential for serious unintended consequences. In fact, I query whether this amendment should be advanced under the rubric of the Sex Discrimination Act at all or whether its proper place is in industrial relations legislation. Indeed, in the view of the coalition, what this amendment reflects is an attempt—perhaps a cynical attempt—to use the suite of discrimination legislation to advance industrial relations agenda which have no place in discrimination law at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum for the bill is particularly unenlightening. The justifi­cation offered for the amendment is this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">For example, an employer who refused to contemplate flexible working arrangements under any circumstances would particularly disadvan</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">­</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">tage people with family responsibilities.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there we have it, Mr Acting Deputy President: the explanatory memorandum itself—against which, as you well know, the terms of the act would be construed by a court or tribunal—tells us that the intention of the drafter and the intention of the government in putting forward this piece of legislation would be to establish a new prohibition against any employer who refused to contemplate flexible working arrangements under any circumstances if a case could then be constructed that a flexible working arrangement in any circumstances might disadvantage people with family responsibilities. It is bogus and false and a legislative sleight of hand to suggest that that is an attempt to advance the cause of antidiscrimination. What it is an attempt to do, as I said, is to use the Sex Discrimination Act as a cover to promote greater inter­ference in the workplace, not in order to protect people from unlawful discrimination but in order to interfere with the legitimate interests of employers and employees in discussing and arriving consensually at decisions about the arrangements within that workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment would do much more than that. The example which I have cited from the explanatory memorandum is evidently wilfully blind to the true effect of the amendment because it ignores the strict liability it imposes. The bill provides that it will be discrimination if a condition, requirement or practice is imposed or proposed that has or is likely to have the effect of disadvantaging a person with family responsibilities. Thus, a struggling company with a casual workforce would be constrain­ed from cutting the hours of its casual employees because those with family responsibilities, with their inherently lower disposable incomes, could be left in a disadvantageous position relative to those with less pressing expenses. It does the cause of antidiscrimination law reform no good at all if the antidiscrimination laws of Australia are used to advance an industrial relations agenda that is in truth unrelated to the bona fide cause of antidiscrimination in a way that punishes, in particular, employers operating small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, I foreshadow that the coalition will be moving amendments to the bill to omit clause 18—that is, the clause which seeks to extend discrimination on the ground of family responsibilities and to create a prohibition on what is called indirect discrimination—and to omit clause 59, which seeks to extend the prohibition of sexual harassment to include customers and contractors n that issue may I say that no case is made for making an employer responsible for unacceptable conduct by a customer of the employer or a contractor to the employer for which in truth the employer has no responsibility, no oversight, does not condone, sanction or direct and, in fact, has  no capacity to control. That is once again an example of using a statute such as this within the category of discrimination law in order to impose inappropriate burdens on employers to govern conduct which is in fact beyond their control. We will also oppose, because we think it to be unnecessary, the extension of the Australian Human Rights Commission's powers proposed by clause 68. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me close by reiterating that just as the coalition has always supported the Sex Discrimination Act and has pioneered antidiscrimination legislation in this country ever since the days of the Fraser government, and at the state level as well, we will be supporting most of the measures in this bill. Australia's population is ageing but older workers are finding it difficult to re-enter the workforce and, anecdotally, to have their applications for employment considered on their merits. So there is a strong case, which we believe and sympathise with, for extending the provisions of the legislation to aged Australians and for creating the office of an age discrimination commissioner. But what we will not do is allow the anti­discrimination laws of Australia to be used as a pretext to impose burdens on business which are not truly prohibitions against discriminatory conduct but seek to impose an industrial relations agenda. If the govern­ment wants to amend the Workplace Relations Act to deal with these matters, that is the appropriate place for them to do so, and let us have the debate in that context. But let us not distort the purpose and objects of discrimination laws for such a purpose. And let us not impose additional, in many cases unendurable, burdens on employers—particularly employers conducting small businesses—under the bogus and false pretext of advancing antidiscrimination.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CROSSIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill before us. I want to provide a bit of background to this legislation and then I intend to address some of the issues that Senator Brandis has just raised in his contribution. The bill before us today is the government's response to the inquiry by the 2008 Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the effectiveness of the 1984 Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act. The inquiry was initiated by me back in 2008, as I had a belief that after 25 years of the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act it was time to undertake a review of that act to look at whether it was still effective and relevant and whether or not it needed to be modernised. So I am delighted to see this legislation before us today. Back in 2008 when we held that inquiry, we came up with quite a number of recommendations—43, in fact—as a result of the review of the act, and this legislation sees some of those recommendations being picked up by this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 was a landmark piece of legislation, as it formally made sex discrimination an illegal practice in Australia. It is amazing to think that the rights that we take for granted today were put in place only 30 years ago. In 2008, during the inquiry into the general relevance of the Sex Discrimination Act and its provisions, we received more than 80 submissions from organisations and individ­uals across the country. Submissions were overwhelmingly in support of the Sex Discrimination Act and its objectives—a stark contrast to the public attitude when the legislation was first introduced into parliament in the early 1980s. But while the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, in its current form, was appropriate at that time, especially since it was the first of its kind on a federal level—and very contentious, of course, back in the early 1980s—it did need to be reviewed and renewed as we headed into the 21st century. The inquiry found ways to improve the law, and while the bill before us today does not address all of those recommendations, it is this government's first steps in that response. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee also conducted an inquiry into this current legislation, the Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This legislation received overwhelming support from those who made submissions to the inquiry, particularly from organisations that specialise and work in the area of discrimination. Nearly all of the submitters were supportive of schedule 1, which seeks to enhance the protections against sex discrimination and sexual harassment that are currently in the Sex Discrimination Act. This bill seeks to protect not only women but also men from sex discrimination. The Sex Discrimination Act in its current form implements certain provisions of CEDAW, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. This bill also extends the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act to men by including the definition of 'relevant international instrument', which would include a range of treaties that promote gender equality, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. n important aspect of this bill is the creation of a separate ground for discrimination—breastfeeding. While dis­crim­ina­tion on the basis of breastfeeding is already prohibited as a subset of sex discrimination since it is only women who breastfeed, the Attorney-General's Depart­ment made clear its reasons for now establishing it as a separate ground for discrimination. The department stated that it will 'make it clearer that actions known as special measures can be taken by employers to address specific requirements of women who are breastfeeding'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative that a modern Australia provides protection from discrimination to women who are breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums all over the country experience discrimination, both direct and indirect, every day simply for trying to feed their newborns, whether it is at work, in shopping centres or in restaurants—as we found recently in Darwin. Discrimination against a breastfeeding mother can also occur subtly. For example, an employer can impose a requirement on employees that prevents them from taking any breaks for set periods during the day under any circumstances, which would consequently disadvantage a woman who needed to express her breastmilk. This bill will also ensure that women breastfeeding in areas of public life—such as accommodation, clubs, education, goods and services and facilities—cannot be prohibited from doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While people are protected by the Sex Discrimination Act from discrimination due to family responsibilities, the act does so only in relation to termination of employ­ment and does not include indirect discrim­ination. The bill seeks to also address this by ensuring that, in employment generally, an employee cannot be discrim­inated against due to family responsibilities. The definition of 'family responsibilities' is expanded to mean the 'responsibilities of a person', rather than an employee, 'to care for or support a dependent child, or any other immediate family member who is in need of care and support'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Employees have shown that discrimination does not have to be direct. The explanatory memorandum for this bill provides examples of both direct and indirect discrimination due to family responsibilities. Direct discrimination, for example, would occur where an employer terminates a person's employment before they return to work from parental leave, on the basis that they consider that the employee's new family responsibilities will interfere with their work. Indirect discrimination, on the other hand, would occur where an employer refuses to consider flexible working arrangements under any circumstances, which would particularly disadvantage people with family responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has consistently recognised that a balance between work and family life is important. The Fair Work Act contains provisions for employers to help employees strike the right balance for all involved. The amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act to ensure employees are protected from discrimination due to family responsibilities complement the reforms made in other areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn for a minute to some of the comments that the previous speaker, Senator Brandis, made. I have great difficulty in understanding the logic behind Senator Brandis's comments. As a former industrial advocate who has worked in a workplace and dealt with discrimination against women in particular and women dealing with family responsibilities I have to say some of his comments indicate to me that he just does not get it. This is not an attempt to impose conditions on employers through some sort of backdoor facility that would otherwise be or should be in the Fair Work Act. This is about complementing and strengthening the rights of people to take action in a workplace where the fair work provisions and the industrial provisions may well be intact. There may well not be a breach of any industrial rights in the workplace; the Fair Work Act may well be shown to have been upheld in a number of these instances. But what this bill does is strengthen the rights of women in particular to take action under those industrial conditions if they believe they have been discriminated against because of their family responsibilities or because they are a woman. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that what Senator Brandis, from his comments, has failed to realise is that the two can actually work in a cooperative way; they can intersect correctly and jointly together. If you listened to Senator Brandis, you would think that you could have only one or the other—that, if you have industrial relations conditions and workplace conditions that can only apply to men and women in the workplace, it prevents you from taking any action under the Sex Discrimination Act. I think he is wrong. It may well be a point of intellectual argument, but I think it is fundamentally wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represented many, many women in the workplace over my industrial advocacy days where the industrial instrument was totally sound and the provisions under that industrial instrument were not broken but were upheld. Employers did what they believed was right according to the legal instrument under the Industrial Relations Act at the time. But, indirectly, their policies failed to recognise that women were not getting the rights they deserved, simply because of their gender, because they had caring responsibilities or because they wanted to be able to return to work and breastfeed. The industrial instrument of the day did not provide flexibility in taking breaks and did not allow an employer to accommodate that in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are going to modernise the workplace, you have to understand that at times employers do actually welcome an intersection between the Sex Discrimination Act and the industrial relations conditions that occur in this country. I do not believe—contrary to what you heard Senator Brandis say—that it has to be one or the other. It has got to be both. At the end of the day, you have got to be able to provide that backup for people in their workplace if they are being victimised, discriminated against, harassed or bullied due to a provision under the Sex Discrimination Act. It does not just have to be: all complaints have to go through Fair Work Australia or all complaints have to go under an industrial relations umbrella. It does not work like that. Otherwise, we would put all Comcare provisions and all super­annuation provisions under one large single piece of legislation in this country. We do not do that. We have different pieces of legislation in the workplace that apply to different people under different circum­stances. As our report shows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The existing prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities in the Sex Discrimination Act protects employees from termination of employment only. Further, the protection is limited to direct discrimination and does not include indirect discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Senate Report recommended that the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities should be broadened to include indirect discrimination and discrimination in all areas of employment …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My report back then went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Evidence to the committee overwhelmingly supported the view that the protection against discrimination on the basis of family responsibilities under the Act is too limited. The current protection is limited to direct discrim­ination resulting in termination. This excludes the most common types of discrimination on this ground such as employees being denied training or promotion, or being demoted or otherwise treated less favourably as a result of their family responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you see you can actually have a provision in an industrial agreement that provides for training and promotion, but the indirect discrimination may clearly show that not everyone in the workplace is getting equal access to those provisions. That is where I think Senator Brandis fundamentally lacked the link between the importance of this legislation to work with and alongside and to complement what is happening in the industrial arena. The committee in 2008 also noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that a failure to strike an appropriate balance between work and caring responsibilities has negative consequences for the health of carers and for their workforce participation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also important to overcoming some entrenched aspects of gender discrimination which continue to lock women into the role of carer and men into the role of breadwinner to the detriment of both sexes. The committee recommends broadening pro­tection against discrimination on this ground—specifically, both direct and indirect discrimination should be prohibited and protected and should extend to all aspects of employment not just termination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you have seen in both the 2008 report and in this report a restatement. As I said previously, you do not have to have just one or the other. The argument has not been raised in either of the Senate committee inquires that for some reason we should not extend this provision on the grounds of family responsibilities under this legislation and only tuck it under an industrial relations instrument. This is the first time I have heard this argument, interestingly from the coalition. It is not a position that was put by the majority of the submitters. The majority of submitters actually welcomed this legislation, welcomed the fact that the Sex Discrimination Act was going to be broadened and strengthened and certainly talked about the way it intersected and worked with any industrial agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act before us ensure that employees are protected against discrimination due to family responsibilities and complement the reforms made in other areas. When the Sex Discrimination Act was created in 1984 the technology we rely on today was not yet in use. Modern tech­nologies, such as the Internet and social networking sites, have many positive uses, but it is also another avenue where sexual harassment can occur. Using the Com­monwealth's power under section 51(v) this bill seeks to prohibit sexual harassment via new technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important amendment includes extending protection against sexual harassment to students, regardless of their age, and removing the requirement that the person responsible for the harassment be at the same educational institution as the victim of the harassment. I want to comment on this because it was a flaw in the original act that we picked up in 2008. If you are a student at an educational institution, for example, under the original piece of legislation you were prevented from taking a claim of harassment against another student, a teacher or anyone else involved unless that person was at the same educational institution. It was a fundamental flaw in the first piece of legislation which we now see is picked up and corrected with this new bill. It will broaden the protection of students while they might be on excursions, sporting trips and camping trips or involved in interschool activities. A claim will now be able to be taken if it is needed. I think that is a welcome change and a modernising to what is happening in our society in terms of when harassment is occurring, how it is occurring and to whom it is occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also we have seen that workers will be protected from sexual harassment by customers, clients and other persons with whom they come into contact in connection with their work. For example, shop assistants will not have to put up with sexual harassment from a customer in their shop. Again this is not something that can be addressed under a provision under Fair Work and it is not something that can be addressed under an industrial relations instrument, because the customer is not party to the industrial relations instrument. Shop assistants should be able to make claims of harassment, bullying or discrimination against members of the general public they deal with. They will be protected by their industrial instrument to do that, but the actual complaint mechanism will be through this bill. The test for sexual harassment will also be amended so that harassment occurs if a reasonable person would anticipate the possibility that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will continue to preserve the operation of state and territory laws to refuse to make, issue or alter an official record of a person's sex if a law of the state or territory requires the refusal because the person is married. The department advised the committee that the Marriage Act 1961 does not ban a person who is married from legally changing their sex, and that full consideration and consultation must be given to the effect this might have on birth, death and marriage laws in states and territories. The Australian government is, however, working with states and territories to consider the many issues raised by the Human Rights Commission in their concluding paper in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill predominately establishes the dedicated position of Sex Discrimination Commissioner. This received strong support during the Senate inquiry. It establishes the office of the commissioner and outlines the terms and conditions in appointing the commissioner. Everyone in this country, regardless of age, should not be prevented from participating in society, including in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):   I wish to raise in the Senate the tragic event of 29 January 2009 when high on the West Gate Bridge in peak-hour traffic a man named Arthur Freeman threw his four-year-old daughter off the bridge to her death. It was morning and Darcy was on her way to attend her first day of school. Arthur Freeman did so in a revenge act towards his former wife. This particular high-profile public act of horror weighs heavily on the minds and hearts of Victorians. It was an act that has wrought unspeakable misery. Its mere contemplation creates an unshakeable dread for so many. I will refer to just some of the victim impact statements made in the court. Kristine Gough, an ambulance officer, was among the first on the scene. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not refer to the heart-wrenching family statements, though they were widely reported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arthur Freeman was convicted by the jury of consciously, voluntarily and intentionally tossing Darcy to her death. However, it took the jury five days to deliberate. The case came exceedingly close to a mistrial, if not for the supreme effort and guidance of the ruling judge. He was strong in his advice that the jury continue to deliberate even when the jury had indicated more than once that it had exhausted all avenues by which to reach a verdict. A reading of the court transcripts shows the judge's thorough attention to every detail in the case. He admirably upheld his oath of office and moreover would not let the truth be buried under any legal or court jargon, any strict procedure or court atmospherics, even human exhaustion and emotion, let alone misleading and false witness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this latter point I wish to take up in the Senate and I do so fully aware I speak under privilege of the parliament. First, as all would be aware of and in full agreement with, it is the foundation stone of our justice system that every person is entitled to a defence. However, they are not entitled to a concocted defence. This, I believe, is what occurred in the Freeman case. I refer to crucial evidence given by Professor Graham Burrows in favour of Arthur Freeman. Professor Burrows was the only one of six psychiatrists who spoke for the accused. Professor Burrows's time in the witness box on 17 March was dutifully and meticulously used to explain away Freeman's deliberate actions. Professor Burrows absurdly claimed Freeman as being 'in a state of serene disassociation' or a 'hypnotic state like sleepwalking'. Burrows actually said: 'Freeman didn't know what he was doing.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every other expert who had the same access to Freeman as Burrows disagreed in the extreme with his analysis. For them, Arthur Freeman knew exactly what he was doing. I add that any common and reasonable person's analysis of the facts of that fateful day would lead them to the same conclusion: that Arthur Freeman knew exactly what he was doing. There was crystal clear fact after crystal clear fact. So it is not good enough for Professor Burrows to hide behind what he would say is his superior knowledge or assessment to that of his peers or say that while his opinion differs his is still an opinion. An opinion is not just an opinion in a murder case. It is held up to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Yet Professor Burrows's time in the witness box came chillingly close to convincing some in the jury and thus dangerously close to getting Freeman off his subsequent murder conviction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps it was because certain members of the jury were in bewilderment of such cruelty coming from a father. Enter Professor Burrows who used his eminent position with an intellectual concoction to give an excuse for such a merciless act. Darcy deserved better than that. Professor Burrows is a gun for hire. He has been described as a psychiatrist of last resort and one who will sing whatever song the defence wants. He has been a star witness for the defence before this particular case. I refer to the Robert Baxter wife killing case, a mirror image defence and performance by Professor Burrows. From the moment Professor Burrows entered the stand in the Freeman case, as the court transcripts will attest, it seems the judge had a rightful suspicion, if not contempt, for this so-called expert. As the judge said, he had crossed paths with Burrows before. While the defence counsel sought to impress the jury with the seemingly eminent credentials of witness Burrows, the judge persistently interrupted the flow of the defence counsel and questioned its relevance. Such was the back and forth of the defence lawyer and the judge on this point, that the court was adjourned on the matter. I refer to but one exchange. The defence counsel, speaking on Burrows' credentials said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All right. Just while I am on my feet, the five pages of degrees, professional activities and memberships and chairmanships and not setting it out—</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">You might appreciate that our paths have crossed in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Defence Counsel</span>: I was sort of guessing that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was it that motivated Professor Burrows to take the stand and argue against the plain truth? Or is it for Professor Burrows a case of 'what is truth'? The position Professor Burrows holds at Melbourne university is quoted in the court transcripts and used to display his eminence before the jury. Professor Burrows is a professorial fellow of the Department of Psychiatry, so I say that the university ought to remove him from that position for the evidence he gave in the Freeman case. The university's reputation must surely be sullied if Professor Burrows remains in that position. I call upon the vice-chancellor to take a stand for common decency and reject the professor's actions. I call upon the vice-chancellor to consider all the facts, to deliberate beyond the excuses like academic freedom or acting outside the university's jurisdiction, and consider the case, its effect on family and society and the university's reputation. I would think that a Melbourne university student of psychiatry would be in peril of misdirection under such a faculty contributor, however occasional. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not rise on this issue and make such claims lightly. Indeed, I am only too aware of how people's lives have been changed, ruined, hurt and affected by this case. It would be easier to let it drift into the mist. However I believe I am compelled to use my position on such an occasion for such a purpose so Professor Burrows may be prevented from being used as a star or eminent witness again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  Thank you, Acting Deputy President Boyce, for this opportunity to speak today, and indeed, for standing in for me in the chair. I want to speak today about the success of the federal government's Building the Education Revolution and also the Teaching and Learning Capital Fund for Vocational Education and Training. It may be a bit unusual for a retiring senator to spend his last weeks criss-crossing vast reaches of Western New South Wales rather than at some overseas location, but I took the opportunity to visit a number of towns and villages in the electorates of Calare and Parkes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that journey I had the pleasure of being able to open school halls, libraries, schoolrooms, science labs, innovative centres and much more. I think I covered 1,400 kilometres in five days. I was able to do this because of the foresight and courage not only of the current government but also the Prime Minister herself. The BER was part of the economic stimulus program announced in February 2009. This meant that there will be 24,000 projects to be delivered over five years in 9,000 schools supporting local jobs in the construction of minor and major infrastructure projects in primary schools or science and language centres in secondary schools. Shortly I will share with the Senate the programs that this government funded and the genuine gratitude that was shown to me as a representative of this government because of our decisions. All up, I was able to announce that this government had spent $11,590,282 in those areas in schools and TAFEs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week in New South Wales it was Catholic Schools Week. It was appropriate, then, that my first school was All Hallows in Gulgong. Gulgong is a famous old gold­mining town where Henry Lawson spent the early part of his life, and in fact the local Labor Party celebrates that formidable feminist, his mother, Louisa Lawson, at an annual Louisa Lawson Dinner. The school, All Hallows, was opened in 1883. The school was run, up until some years ago, by the order that founded it, the Order of Sisters of St Joseph, that is, St Mary McKillop's order. She may well have visited that school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The building itself was constructed in the Spanish Mission style. The school received $1.4 million. The project was managed by that exceptional group of men in the Catholic Education Office in the diocese of Bathurst. The executive director, Peter Hill, was present, as were those chaps from that division, Brian Morrissey and Gerry Lynch. The school has 120 students, and the school captains, Grace Hensley and Olivia Sevin, gave me a tour of the facilities in which they learn. Principal Catherine Gaudry, staff, parents and locals worked hard to get that new classroom, library and the multipurpose refurbishments delivered on time and on budget. It did support the employment of 40 local workers and everybody is proud of the outcome, despite the snickers of those opposite. Indeed, the extensions were blessed by Monsignor Frawley who had a hall named after him, and also by Father Bellamy, who did not have one named after him—maybe he will later. I moved from there to Borenore Public School. This school has been going since May 1876 and the BER, our program, delivered an impressive structure including a new library. The BER funds amounted to $300,000. This primary school has 40 students, and this figure has almost doubled in the last few years. The school captains, Gabrielle Guisard and James Maclennan, gave me a very professional tour of the school. The Principal, Ruth Harris, a former schoolgirl from Tullibigeal—I am sure Senator Nash knows where that is—</span>

                  </a>  spoke at the opening, as did Paul Stirling from the New South Wales Department of Education and Training. I would also like to make a special mention of the school cleaners, Max and Colleen Baker, who retired after 35 years of cleaning the school. Also present at the opening was Cabonne shire councillor Kevin Duffy, who is a former ALP candidate. Kevin advised me that his family has been handing out Labor how-to-votes at Borenore Public School for well over a century—and not once have we won that booth. I suggested that maybe it was time we changed families! </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Catholic school at Eugowra is named St Joseph's. It received $1.24 million from the BER program. The Catholic Education Office out at Bathurst did their usual exceptional and very professional job. For those opposite, 40 jobs were created as a result of the initiative of this government. There are 33 students at this school. It was founded in 1882, again by the Sisters of St Joseph, and St Mary MacKillop may have visited here as well. I was greeted by the school captains, Sophie Welsh and Troy Park. Peter Hill and his team were there, as was the Cabonne shire mayor, Bob Dowling, who sat on my left—I suggested to Bob that that is probably the only time he has been on the left of anything—and councillors Kevin Duffy and Janelle Culverson. The Principal, Kathy Eppelstun, expressed her extreme gratitude for what the federal government had given the school community. Father Dooley blessed it. There was also a nun who had taught there, Sister Kathy Jennings. A nice sideline was that a cake was cut at the opening of the school hall and it was cut by the oldest known former student, Ron Sloane, who left school in 1929, and the youngest, Olivia Holland.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a great day at Eugowra. The St Joseph's community were particularly generous to me. I do not think I need to declare this to the Senate but I was given a variety of gifts. I was given a nice wool clip that I understand contributed to the making of Prince William's jacket. I was given a bit of the marble that was mined there that is in the hall outside. I was also given some honey, wine and soap.</span>

From there I went to Lake Cargelligo Central School and inspected the new science centre and the refurbished primary classrooms. The school received $3 million under the BER. It has 210 students, of whom 30 per cent are of Indigenous background. The Principal, Margaret Chamen, the teachers and students were very, very happy with what the BER money had been at able to do for them. I was given an impressive welcome by the Aboriginal dance group, a great reception by the kids and a great lunch put on by them. Again, there were shire councillors there: Des Manwaring from Lachlan shire; an old mate of mine, Graham Scott, and Bob Sanson, who is the local representative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I attended the opening of programs at the TAFE New South Wales Western Institute in Orange. I had an opportunity to look at the Green Skills Trade Centre, which I opened, and other programs that the government contributed to. The government contribution here was $5.6 million. It employed many locals. It gave some of the apprentices an opportunity to test out their skills and it is going to make a valuable contribution to the local economy. In 2010 this institute had enrolled 40,556 students, of whom 7,132 were Aborigines. That is an increase from 2009 of 589. The building where the centre is located is truly spectacular and any members of the Greens would be smacked by the innovation of the imaginative teachers. Indeed, the mobile mining simulator and the in-house one are very important. These courses train men and women to work in the mining industry. As a number of us would be well aware, there is plenty of work in mining out in western New South Wales. The mobile simulator is able to move between a variety of communities, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, and it allows people to be trained to work in the mining industry. I would like to congratulate Sandra Gray and Rebecca Wilcox, who were my guides on the day, and the institute's well respected director, Kate Baxter, a great leader. I was joined on the day by another old mate of mine, John Davis, whom I first met when he was the Mayor of Blayney and who is now the Mayor of Orange, and by an old sparring partner, John Cobb, the member for Calare, who turned up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have detailed my visit to western New South Wales because I want it understood how many BER and other initiatives this government has taken up have been overwhelmingly well received. The BER gave schools a once in a lifetime chance to do those things that they needed to have done but other priorities pressed. It provided work for locals where work was a bit quiet. It gave communities halls to be used by all, libraries, classrooms, science labs and, in Orange, a spectacular skills centre and practical courses for the mining industry in which Newcrest is actively involved. These decisions that we, the government, made were not supported by all in this parliament, but they are definitely supported by the communities I went to in the last week in the electorates of Parkes and Calare. All the programs were delivered on time and on budget. And it has to be said that the Prime Minister was the minister who pioneered this initiative, and the facilities these students enjoy today and will enjoy into the future are a product of her leadership. These people have said to me in no uncertain terms how grateful they are for the projects that this government has delivered to regional education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="QD4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOB BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I wish to follow on from Senator Hutchins's account of his trip by accounting to the Senate a trip which I took to Papua New Guinea, beginning on Thursday, 28 April. I have wanted to go to this marvellous country, which is our nearest neighbour, for many, many years. This was the first time I did, and I spent four days with my partner, Paul Thomas, in that country. At the outset we received a remarkably warm welcome from Dorothy Tekwie, who was, on that or the next day, elected as the President of the Papua New Guinea Green Party. Dorothy Tekwie was in Australia just a few months ago and toured many states, including my home state of Tasmania. She made an enormous impression on everybody who met her and who listened to her speak about the problems confronting her home country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I think it was a call to Australia, their wealthier neighbours to the south, to take a little bit more notice of what is happening in Papua New Guinea affairs. It is an independent country which is resource rich, and in many ways, including that one, it has parallels with this country of ours. What is notable is the extraordinary power of the mining corporations and the logging corporations which are currently operating and intending to operate in Papua New Guinea. They are making decisions outside that country but being facilitated by a political system where corruption is not a foreign entity but is part of the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with the Acting Deputy High Commissioner for Australia, John Feakes, shortly after arriving. We were later to meet the High Commissioner, Ian Kermish, and we had the services of Tim Bryson from the commission who, by the way, along with the High Commissioner, grew up in Papua New Guinea. They are very well placed to be representing Australia in that country and I thank them for their assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We spent two days in Port Moresby and two days in Madang. I want to give some of my impressions in the short time that is available on matters that we do not often hear aired in this chamber. Firstly, Papua New Guinea, as we all know, has been a functioning democracy since, during the Whitlam years, Australia handed across the reins of self-government. There are just over 100 members of parliament and only one of them is a woman: Dame Carol Kidu. I met her at a meeting of the United Nations organisation in Port Moresby. In fact, we were hosted by the United Nations Development Program there, and the Papua New Guinea Council of Women were in strong attendance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Carol told me about the progress of a bill for 22 places to be allocated to women in future parliaments to try to redress this imbalance. I was able to point out that for the first time in six years following the last election Australia's representation of women in parliament has fallen below 30 per cent. However, it is a very different situation to there being a solitary woman in the Papua New Guinea parliament. Dame Carol will not mind me saying publicly—she made no bones about it there—that after three terms she will not be standing at the next election. I wish well the women and the men behind the move to have this legislation through the parliament in time for the next elections next year—and this includes the Prime Minister of New Guinea, Prime Minister Somare, who was recovering from heart surgery in Singapore while I was in the country; I wish him well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got a very good briefing from Margaret Lokoloko and other members of the PNG Council of Women at the reception. They are remarkable advocates for the representation of women in their parliament and I hope they have success. The bill was gazetted just before I went to Port Moresby and it is in the hands of a parliamentary debate. I would say to the men of the Papua New Guinea parlia­ment, as a man of the parliament here in Australia, that nothing but good can come from having an increased representation of women in the parliament, if my experience of 15 years in this parliament—and before that 10 years in the Tasmanian parliament—is anything to go by. It is not just a counter­balancing contribution to parliament; having more women in the parliament lifts the standard of parliament's debate, content and representation of the people. ining is a huge industry in Papua New Guinea, and I want to talk about just a couple of the current huge mines proposed in that country. One of them is the Ramu nickel mine east of Madang on the northern mainland of Papua New Guinea. This is largely Chinese owned. It was established on the work of the Australian company, Highlands Pacific, which still has a nine per cent interest and which I understand could increase that to 22 per cent in the future depending on the success of the mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mine has been established well inland from the coast, and a processing factory is established on the coast. This is as a result of a quite huge investment by the Chinese company involved. However, it is held up in the courts because of the intention to simply dump the tailings of this massive mine straight into the ocean. When I asked the Department of Environment and Conser­vation in Port Moresby about this—the fact that those tailings are going to be dumped into a sea canyon off the coast—I was unable to elicit any real information about the ecological systems on that marine floor. I got a specious response that the watercourses, particularly when they are in flood, take silt out into the ocean and that this canyon has been receiving that as a matter of natural systems for a long time, so, effectively, what would putting mine tailings on top of it matter? I was horrified by that response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter has been taken up by landowners. Fisheries are very important to large numbers of people in this part of Papua New Guinea—well, the whole of coastal Papua New Guinea, but that includes New Ireland, New Britain and Bougainville to the north and east of the mainland. I understand that a court determination will be made on 23 May. But when I asked the Department of Environment and Conservation if they would take it to appeal if the landowners and environmentalists win there, I did not hear 'no' to that. When I asked if the government would move to legislate to override the court decision on existing law if an appeal is then successful, I again did not get a 'no' to it. We must be very fearful that we are looking at a process where even the due implementation of the law, if it were to prevent that dumping of massive amounts of tailings into the ocean, may be overridden by people who have more influence in the governance of Papua New Guinea than the local landowners do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at a forum of non-government organisations in Madang, and it was a very impressive group of people. Present also were local members of parliament Ken Fairweather and Jamie Maxtone-Graham, and I thank Mr Fairweather for a night's accommodation at the local seaside hotel, which was most enjoyable. We had a swim in the ocean and it was not until the next day that I was asked if I saw any salties while I was out there. Apparently there are a few saltwater crocodiles around. They cannot have been hungry or close enough, or I may not have been delivering this talk to you today. Actually, there were plenty of other people fishing and so on in the ocean. It is a big atoll, and just fascinating. I will come back in a moment to Mr Fairweather's efforts to stop the establishment of a series of fish-canning factories which may put their offal straight out into the ocean if that industrial plant goes ahead close to what is a stunningly beautiful part of the world at Madang.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The representative from New Ireland got up and delivered a most compelling concern about Nautilus Minerals, which is to be the world's first seabed mining operation controlled by robots. There is a Singaporean ship in the ocean south of New Ireland at the moment, and the divers are down there. This is to be remotely controlled, and it is effectively about bulldozers on the seafloor which extract the minerals that are going to make somebody somewhere wealthy and dump the results of that mining straight there onto that marine ecosystem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The threats of that form of process are global. The London Sea Dumping Convention would prevent the Ramu nickel mine from doing what it is doing, and the Australian company would know that. It could not do that in Australia—this is the nickel mine dumping into a canyon. The proponents of Nautilus Minerals have, no doubt, started their experiments off the sea coast for the same reason. They are doing it in Papua and New Guinea, but it is a process coming to affect the oceans of the whole world. I gave a commitment then and there to the representatives from New Ireland that I would move in this Senate to have an inquiry into deep sea seabed mining, and I intend to ask the Senate to seek a government inquiry into the process so that we can assess what that means for our own country's natural marine resources and fisheries into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to Mr Fairweather's petition, which he was handing around at the Catholic university where I spoke in Madang. It is about these sea fisheries and simply says, 'Statement by Ken Fairweather MP, member for Sumkar, Madang Province. We need a fishing ban on foreign vessels. Recent suggestions by the European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Fishing Agency to reduce fishing in our waters by 30 per cent does not do enough. PNG—indeed, the South Pacific—needs a five year ban on all foreign fishing in our waters. It is simple really: (1) PNG gets no real revenue from commercial fishing; and, (2) there are few fish left in the seas. Tuna schools have collapsed, yet waters off New Ireland and Bougainville are the breeding grounds for tuna. The Kavieng fishing factory—PNG owned and operated—cannot fill its orders. Village fishermen are giving up fishing in despair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NFA—the National Fishing Authority—says it is going to do a fish stocktake of the seas. Saying it is going to do that is lies and humbug. Go on a boat in the water around Madang; you will not see a seabird or catch a fish,'—and he is referring to the big fish that used to be caught in any amount. Tuna are now an endangered species in PNG waters. We are now forced to set up false reefs and FADs'—fish-attracting devices—'to help villages catch fish. PNG needs a determined inland fish farming program, not lip service and chickenshit money thrown at some mad scheme.' That is a call by a member of the Papua New Guinea parliament for foreign investors in PNG to respect the idea that the fisheries of PNG, upon which so many million people directly or indirectly rely, be allowed to recover, not be further depleted by a series of projects such as mining and onshore industrial works—indeed, logging affects this as well—which are running down the fisheries of this very important neighbour of ours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Senate for listening to this brief of the trip to PNG, and my heartfelt thanks goes to all the hosts in that beautiful, wonderful country to our north, with whom we should be much more fruitfully engaged.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, firstly, some of the significant announcements last night in the budget were, of course, the announcements around the deficit: $49.4 billion this year, the second-largest since World War II and $8.6 billion worse than was forecast in last year's budget. We have a forecast for the budget deficit in 2011-12 blown out by $9.6 billion to $22.6 billion. We have a net government debt increasing to a record $107 billion in 2011-12. Remember: when we came to government back in 1996, there was $96 billion worth of debt, and that took us 10 years to pay off. The government has managed to rack that up in just a few short years.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator NASH:</span>
                  </a>  I note government senators on the other side are already starting to spark up. I am not surprised that they are a little bit tender when things are pointed out about this budget that they really will not like at all. This government is borrowing $135 million a day. What I think will really interest families and people working—indeed, everyone around this country—is the interest on that government debt, which is going to cost $20 million a day. That is, to put it in context for people around Australia who may or may not be listening, $4,700 debt a day for every single Australian. When you look at those figures, how can you possibly consider that this is a good budget for the Australian people?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, the Treasurer is keeping the focus, as I am sure he would like to do, on this wafer-thin, $3.5 billion surplus that we are apparently going to get in 2012-13. I say don't hold your breath. The chances of that happening—they may well—are about as thin as the figure that has been presented to us. The Treasurer, you can see very clearly, is using this as a distraction. He is jumping straight to 2012-13, saying: 'Look at this surplus. Isn't this fantastic? We're on track to get the surplus.' What he is not mentioning nearly as often is the almost $50 billion deficit we have this year and the almost $23 billion deficit we have for the next financial year. It is extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget has no inclusion whatsoever of the carbon tax. That has serious implications for the veracity of the budget. There is no doubt about that. And this is a carbon tax, I might add, that what seems to be a very few short months ago—just before the last election—the Prime Minister promised the Australian people we would not have. This was a carbon tax we would not have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Prime Minister said. It did not take long before we had the government—I am sorry: the Labor-Greens-Independents government—which meant that apparently Australia was now going to get a carbon tax. I can tell you right now the Nationals and Liberals will be doing everything we possibly can to stop that. But, having promised not to have a carbon tax and then telling the Australian people they were now going to have one, there is no inclusion of it in this budget. There is nothing. They have completely ignored the importance of one of the most important issues for this country over the years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move on to what this budget has for regional Australia, and I have to say it is precious little. There is no plan, there is no strategy and that is not surprising at all from what is a weak and indecisive government. There is no vision. Where is the vision? Where is the plan for regional Australia from this government? The commitment to regional education in the budget is very big on talk but very short on detail. The attention to agriculture is nothing short of pitiful. There is not much more than empty promises for regional development. There are a whole range of areas, but they are the ones I will particularly focus on today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen in regional education is something called the Regional Priorities Round of the Education Investment Fund. What this is is a $500 million raid of the Education Investment Fund for some priorities round that has absolutely no detail behind it—remembering, of course, that that funding was there because of the coalition in the first place. But there is no detail at all on how this will work. What is particularly curious is the fact that in Budget Paper No. 2, where this particular measure for the Education Investment Fund Regional Priorities Round is put forward, it has the rather extraordinary sentence at the bottom saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This measure delivers on the Government's agreement with the Member for Lyne, and the Member for New England.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unprecedented that in a budget paper there should be a reference to a particular member of parliament. That is extraordinary. It just shows the depth to which this government has had to go because of this Labor-Greens-Independent government. That is what it is: it is a Labor-Greens-Indepen­dent government. The thing here is: who is in charge of this country? This country is like a ship without a captain. We have no idea where it is headed because we never know when the next thing is going to come from the Greens or the Independents that is going to shunt the Prime Minister off in another direction. We simply do not have a clue. It should not be a budget paper; it should be BS propaganda. This is extraordinary stuff from a government that has no idea about strategy and a plan for the future of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot help but compare the use of the Education Investment Fund for this. The coalition has been saying for months that the Education Investment Fund should be utilised to fix the problem of independent youth allowance for students in the inner regional areas. The government would not use the funding out of the Education Investment Fund to fix a problem right now that they have said that they cannot fix because of cost and they cannot possibly fix the Education Investment Fund for that. But what do we see here, Senator Mason? We see that they are quite happy to raid it for some funding that is going to appease the Independents. It is extraordinary stuff. Students across the country should quite rightly be absolutely furious that they have been left out in the cold by this government when there was a perfect funding measure available for this government to use to fix the problem and to treat regional students fairly regardless of where they live when it comes to independent youth allowance. It is shame on the government that they refuse and continue to refuse to fix that measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What there is in the budget for agriculture is pathetic. Of the 350 pages, 7½ pages are devoted to agriculture. Take out the five pages that are dedicated to the winding-up of drought assistance in EC, there are 2½ pages. Australian farming and the related sectors generate $155 billion a year in production. They underpin this nation. They contribute 12.1 per cent of GDP. And they get 2½ pages in the budget from this government. That shows more clearly than anything the complete disregard this government has for rural and regional Australia. There is no vision and there is no strategy. It is appalling. No wonder people across regional Australia are screaming out about the complete disregard and the complete disconnection from this government when it comes to the future for regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2050 we are going to have a global population of around nine billion people, and the issue of food security is going to be huge. This government completely ignore it. They have absolutely no idea. The Treasurer, as we have seen through this budget, simply does not have a clue. He is clearly clueless. Not only did his budget not contain anything significant at all for the future of regional Australia, but we have also seen the Treasurer just recently, apparently, approve the sale of a significant proportion of our grain handling and storage facilities to a privately-held American company, Cargill. The Treasurer has not even gone on the record himself to say that he has done this; this has come from the company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this is potentially going to do to this country is extraordinary when we look at the issue of food security. We are potentially going to have a privately-held American company that is not subject to the same transparency as publicly-listed companies having a significant degree of control over our grain silos, through the system, through the rail system, and potentially having a 50 per cent ownership of Melbourne Port. And, in terms of competition, we are potentially going to have the Coles and Woolworths of the grain industry through GrainCorp and Cargill. And what is the Treasurer doing? He goes, 'Okay; that's fine. No problems.' There are no ideas about conditions or anything that should be placed on this. It is the perfect example of the fact that the Treasurer has no idea about what is needed for the future of food security in this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have regional development. This is really quite an extraordinary area. I will just run through a few of the issues. We have millions set aside for a website called MyRegion—which appears to be duplicating other websites and maybe even duplicating the local Yellow Pages, if you look at it closely enough. I think there is about $4.2 million going to that. We have got millions going to regional development committees to do things like funding forums, sitting fees, web engagements and interdepartmental agreements—millions of dollars on this sort of activity—but where are the things of real substance for regional?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly like this one: $19 million on 34 regional strategists, who are actually going to tell regional people what they already know about problems faced with regional education and skills. Compare that to the fact that in the budget the government has failed to address the very important issue of attracting teachers to regional areas and retaining them. The government in its budget has completely failed to address that issue. Then we see that the Building Regions Fund is losing $100 million dollars; yet Sustainable Suburbs gets an extra $100 million allocated to metropolitan suburbs to support employment. This government are completely clueless as to what the strategy is for a sustainable regional Australia into the future. You only to have to look at the fact that they refused to acknowledge the unfairness for students in the inner regional zones when it comes to independent youth allowance to know that they simply do not understand the needs of regional Australia. et us just look at that in the context of the budget. Because of this government's debt, because we are running up to $107 billion worth of debt, this government has to pay $20 million a day. In just five days the government would have enough money to pay for an entire year for the changes that need to be made to the independent youth allowance so that all regional students can be treated fairly—just five days of interest. These regional students are being hung out to dry because this government refuses to fix the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget that has precious little for regional Australia. This is a government that is clearly unable to understand what is needed in the regions. Where is the plan? Where is the plan that says: in 2020, 2030, 2050, this is how we want regional Australia to look? There is nothing in the budget for them. It is all just about the next election cycle—for the government and the Prime Minister, if she is indeed leading the government at the next election. The Australian people deserved better than that. They deserved a budget that was substantive and they deserved a budget that was going to deliver a strong future for the Australian people, which is what they would have got from a coalition government.</span>

What an extraordinary thing! This is a budget which is about bringing the budget back into the black, a budget that is about jobs, jobs, jobs—creating jobs, training people for jobs and getting more people into jobs—and the best they can come with is: 'We don't like a levy to help rebuild Queensland. 'That is the best they can come up with! It is amazing, isn't it? This is an opposition which in government was happy to have a levy to help the sugar industry and happy to have a levy to buy back guns, but they are still fighting an argument on a levy to help rebuild Queensland and other areas of Australia that were hit by a natural disaster.

Why then has the government failed to offset new spending in both 2010-11 and 2011-12 with savings, increasing the deficit by more than $7 billion?

Second, the net save/spend position in this budget is a net save in excess of $5 billion. And I should say that, in terms of restraint on expenditure, the average real growth in expenditure in the years of this budget is about one per cent per year. Under Peter Costello, in his last five budgets it was around three per cent a year—I am talking about real growth. The last time a government showed this sort of expenditure restraint was in the 1980s. This is a budget that brings the budget back to surplus and puts more Australians into jobs, trains more Australians and increases participation. If Senator Cormann wants to talk about performance, why don't we talk about Mr Hockey's performance last night and this morning? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Now that the minister has started talking about tight fiscal discipline and limiting spending growth, does she accept that the government's commitment to keep spending growth below two per cent in real terms is a very easy target to achieve given that government spending is coming off a highly inflated base with spending growth of more than 17 per cent over the last two years in real terms, the highest since Whitlam?</span>

How is it possible that you can come back to surplus and oppose savings measures? Perhaps the opposition should have a think about that.</span>

It is a surplus achieved by taking some $22 billion worth of savings and a surplus achieved despite the significant downgrade in revenues from the legacy effects of the global financial crisis as well as the effects of a high dollar and the floods and disasters on the Australian economy—things that the opposition seem to like to avoid. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen revenue write-downs in 2010-11 and 2011-2012 of some $16.3 billion but, despite this, this government has taken the decisions to ensure the budget comes back to surplus and that the budget prepares Australians for the increase in employment which we will see continue. Remember, this is a government under which there have been some 750,000 jobs created and we anticipate another 500,000 jobs in the year ahead. It is a budget focused on ensuring we reprioritise expenditure, make spending cuts and apply our investment to those things which are good for the economy, good for Australian workers and good for Australian families.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that some of the decisions in this budget will not be popular, but they are necessary because we must build surpluses. We must not compound the price pressures we know will increase as a result of the gathering pace of the mining boom. That is why the government have made the disciplined decisions necessary to achieve that surplus. We look forward to the opposition finding some semblance of economic responsibility in the number of hours between now and the budget reply. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Some of them are quite novel. It might be instructive for senators from the opposition to be aware of just where Mr Hockey is taking them. Mr Hockey has committed to bringing the budget back to surplus by 2011-12. He has done it all by himself but he has committed you to it. He also says he does not want to support the government's savings measures. He is complaining that a number of the measures that the government put forward in last night's budget which will return funds to the budget to help the return to surplus should be opposed. I wonder if opposition senators, who pretend to care about economic and fiscal responsibility, would be aware that they have been put in a position of opposing savings measures but delivering a surplus earlier. It simply does not add up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In its agreement with the Independents to form government, the government agreed to invest $1.4 billion in community infrastructure. Can the minister please outline how much of this money is being spent on regional infrastructure projects over the forward estimates as outlined in last night's budget, and did your negotiations with the Independents insist on investment in such things as crazy ants, the Australian Antarctic Division, Canberra centenary celebrations and Perth airport roads?</span>

I know that is embarrassing for the National Party who, when they were in coalition, never managed to deliver what a Labor government with this parliament has delivered last night. I can understand why Senator Joyce might feel a little embarrassed about that issue. an I go through some of the many investments in regional Australia that the government is putting in place. There is a $4.3 billion investment in health, education and infrastructure initiatives for the benefit of regional Australians. One of those is, as the senator would know, the Health and Hospitals Fund where there is a commitment of $1.8 billion, of which $1.3 billion was delivered last night. There were a great many regional hospitals and other health investments out of that $1.3 billion fund for Queensland and for states and territories all around Australia. I hope that the coalition will be supportive of those investments in regional health programs. In addition, the government is delivering a $500 million investment in the regional priorities round of the Education Investment Fund to support capital investments in regional higher education and vocational education. So they are amongst the $4.3 billion worth of investments in regional Australia delivered under this government and in this budget.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, on the point of order: Senator Wong has indicated that the question is most likely well outside the budget portfolio that she has. Together with that, it is a question about an announcement in March by the regional development minister, Simon Crean, about a $1 billion announcement. Minister Wong also indicated that she would have a look at that. But, notwithstanding that response, Minister Wong was also directly relevant to the question by dealing with the substance of the matter—that is, the question around the $1 billion announcement. All of that means that Senator Joyce is well outside his comfort zone in asking this question and I would ask that no point of order be recorded.</span>

Can he tell the Senate what he knows about the logging of the Gulaga Mountain, south of Narooma in New South Wales? Is it true that this process is being taken under contract with the New South Wales forestry department by a Tasmanian logging company, which was given an $825,000 payout under the minister's $17 million funding of Tasmanian contractors? Did the minister facilitate this contractor from Tasmania to outcompete other potential contractors in New South Wales against my advice to him before he issued or signed off on that contract last year?</span>

We did exceed that commitment on 23 November 2010 when we announced $22.4 million for the Australian government funding package. If I go through the explanation of the package, it will answer the question you asked about New South Wales because this package was designed to deal with the oversupply of contractors in that sector while continuing to support viable ongoing businesses in Tasmania. The package was developed following discus­sions with the Tasmanian government representatives from the Tasmanian forestry industry and the CFMEU. The measures included both exit and financial support measures. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Under the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities there is a line item, point 3, where the government will provide $0.3 million in 2011-12 to support signatories to the Tasmanian forest statement of principles leading to an agreement among other relevant organisations to better engage and consult with their membership in the negotiation process and assistance will be provided to industry, environmental organisations, unions and other groups. As I indicated, that is within the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, but I am happy to provide that information out of Budget Paper No. 2 as an explanation of what that is used for. In the broader issue that you mentioned, I will see what further information I can provide.</span>

                  </a>  There was a time when those opposite cared about their economic credibility and cared about their fiscal credibility. Now you have got Mr Hockey running around promising surpluses but opposing savings, which, as you know, does not add up. We also have Mr Abbott, who we know has previously described economics as very 'boring'; and rather than talking about something that bores him like how you bring the budget back into the black and secure the future prosperity of the nation all he wants to do is run around and say, 'Where's the carbon price?' That is all he wants to talk about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the Australian people are on to you. They know that the only reason you want to talk about the carbon price is that you have nothing to say on the budget, you have nothing to say about the jobs of Australians, you have nothing to say about how we bring the budget back into surplus and you have nothing to say about building the workforce for this nation's future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If somehow the allegation is that we should have put the carbon price into this budget, as we have said on many occasions, we will account for the carbon price after it has been finalised in the first update post those decisions. That is what we have said, and we are no different in that to Mr Howard, who promised an emissions trading scheme, but never put it in his budget. Mr Howard talked about a GST in 1997 but did not put it into his budget for a couple of years. What we are doing is no different to what Mr Howard did. We will account for it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:36</span>):  I thank Senator Cameron for the question and his interest in the important issue of skilling up Australians. The most important thing a government can do is to give people the security and dignity that comes with a job, and this government has a very proud record on jobs. During the global financial crisis we saved hundreds of thousands of jobs by our investment stimulus, and since coming to government we have created 750,000 jobs in the economy. abor is the party of work, jobs and opportunity. That is why this budget will get more Australians into work. We will invest in skills, we will let many people keep more of their pay when they take up work and we will require more from those who are not working. Labor believes that those who can work should work and those who want to work should have the opportunity to gain the skills they need to enter the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the government announced a $3 billion investment in skills and training initiatives over six years to ensure Australia has the skilled workers the economy needs and ensure more Australians can benefit from our growing prosperity. Through these measures, we are putting industry at the heart of the training effort with a new national workforce development fund that will be administered by an independent, industry led workforce agency; reforming the apprentice­ship system to make it more modern and flexible, including accelerated apprentice­ships and mentoring support; and increasing access to the workforce for disadvantaged Australians by addressing the barriers that they confront.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians find themselves locked out of our success, sitting on the sidelines unable to join the workforce for a whole range of reasons. This budget gives them the chance to get off the sideline and get into the game, to share in our nation's success and build a better life through skills development.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even with this success, the Gillard government recognised the need for reform when we commissioned an independent review of the Australian apprenticeships system by an expert panel last year. That report provides a clear direction for reform of the Australian apprenticeship system. The package announced in the budget this year is the Gillard government's initial direction-setting response to the panel's recom­mendation and is informed by stakeholder consultations. We are investing over $200 million in initiatives to boost apprenticeship completion rates by introducing mentoring support and competency based training that allow us to see more apprentices start and complete their apprenticeships and join the workforce with high skills. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

When the minister said this morning that this budget is a 'very Labor budget', was she referring to the fact that net debt is now set to peak at $107 billion next year and will remain above $100 billion for at least the next four years? How does this reconcile with the govern­ment's supposedly 'tight fiscal rules'? Is the minister proud that she has now topped Paul Keating's debt record of $96 billion?</span>

It might be useful to remember how that compares with the net debt figures of other major advanced economies. The average peak net debt figure of major advanced economies is over 90 per cent of GDP. Ours peaks at 7.2 per cent; the average net debt peak of advanced economies is in excess of 90 per cent of GDP. So let us get a bit of perspective into how much stronger our economy is as a result of where we are in the world, the nature of the terms of trade and the actions of this government to invest in the economy to support jobs, opposed by those opposite. Let us get some perspective of how much stronger our economy is than other major advanced economies.</span>

We have laid out the details of how we return to surplus. We have made spending cuts and we have exercised substantial spending restraint. As I said, on average over the budget periods real growth in Commonwealth expenditure is one per cent per year. Peter Costello delivered an average of 3.6 per cent per year in his last five budgets. At the conclusion of the forward estimates, Commonwealth govern­ment spending as a proportion of GDP declines under us. That was the test, or one of the tests, that the opposition, in its lead-up to the budget, was propounding. But, if the senator cares about the surplus, he will pass the government savings measures. If he cares about the surplus he will pass the saves. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But if the senator cares about debt levels—and he appears to—then he should be pressuring and demanding that his shadow Treasurer and his leader lay out their path for a return to surplus, because if he does not and if they do not then we will know that what Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott really stand for is wrecking the surplus through opposing savings measures that the government is putting in place. That is what you will be known for, and no amount of rhetoric will get you out of that particular bind. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

One is dealing with the change of name. As we know, births, deaths and marriages are state responsibilities, and they deal with them, so deed poll changes are not a matter for the Commonwealth as far as I am aware. But if I am wrong about that then I will correct the record. In terms of privacy, it is not a privacy matter per se if you want to change your name and deal with births, deaths and marriages in a state registry. They may require and have to keep privacy issues surrounding births, deaths and marriages and those matters. So I am just attempting to separate the two issues out. In terms of privacy, of course, this government has significant reform in this area. We have already announced the first tranche of reform of the privacy legislation.</span>

But, to the extent that I can take that on notice and get further and better particulars in relation to the primary issue, I will.</span>

We do seem to have jumped a fraction from the initial substance of the question—which I thought did go to privacy, which is within Minister O'Connor's portfolio, which deals with privacy reform—to an issue which now is subsumed within the Attorney-General's portfolio, dealing with the AFP and how to effectively close this particular loophole. In looking at this issue, I am not aware of it having been raised two years ago in Senate estimates. However, if it has been, I will certainly ask the Attorney-General's portfolio to have a look at Senate estimates and to examine the issue that you have raised and provide an explanation, to the extent that they are able to, as to the work that they are conducting. In and around what I think you have identified is an issue where people with— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I will take the question on notice to ensure I am correct, but my recollection is that there is a significant amount of information-sharing between the Commonwealth, through the Australian Federal Police, and the states and territories. They use CrimTrac, which is a body that has been set up to deal with the sharing of criminal information.

This government took to the last election the policy to extend a higher level of family tax benefits to families with teenagers who were still in study and in training. We think that is a sensible policy that will mean more families get higher levels of support through the family payment system. That policy was fully funded, fully costed and has been provisioned for in last night's budget. If the opposition want to complain about measures we have taken to target the family payment system to ensure it is more sustainable, I hope the opposition will live up to its own rhetoric and point to what other savings it would put forward if it wishes to oppose those measures.

                  </a>  Here we have the hypocrisy on the opposition side. On the one hand we have Senator Cormann wanting to be tough—'You haven't been tough enough'—and then you have Senator Eggleston and others who are interjecting on that side saying that we should not put in place measures to better target family payments so that they are more sustainable into the future. You cannot have it both ways. This is the problem that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey has. On the one hand he wants a bigger surplus and wants it earlier, but he is opposing savings. The Australian people are entitled to something a little more coherent from the alternative government than the complete mess they are presenting in response to this budget.</span>

I do not see that appearing anywhere in their election costings or subsequently. I think people know, if they are watching this question time, the sorts of politics that are being played on the other side and they know this: there is no sensible response to the opposition as yet on this budget—a budget which is very important for Australia's future; a budget that brings the budget back to black; a budget which is focused on creating jobs, training more people for jobs and getting more people into jobs. That is what this budget is about. But what do we see from the other side? Absolutely nothing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Senator Sherry, of course, is interjecting—and he is one of the greatest recalcitrants on the other side. He cannot answer a question. He is not across his portfolio and all he does is either snooze or interject during question time—and normally in that order.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to talk about what this budget does not include, which means that it is not set in stone but rather it is a budget built on sand. This budget will not stop the boats. This budget will not pay off debt, but rather will increase it. This budget will not put the budget into surplus. No-one believes this government can ever, ever deliver a budget surplus. It will take very, very minimal movement in the economy of China—upon which this surplus is built—for the surplus to dissipate in front of our very eyes. This budget will not stop the government's waste and mismanagement. It will not ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families, but rather will add to them. It will not assist private health insurance and it will not do anything about the government's dishonest dealings with the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what this budget will do is impose a carbon tax and a mining tax and destroy private health insurance. It will increase net debt. It will require the borrowings of approximately $135 million per day this financial year and, over the next four years, $20 million a day in borrowings—$4,200 for every Australian over the next four years. This is a government that inherited a strong economy. This is a government that inherited a budget surplus. This is a government that inherited no debt. And in the short space of three years they have driven the net debt into the second highest in this country's history. It was a despicable act last night. It was not a budget; it was an excuse for inactivity. It was an excuse for a government that simply has not got any control of itself. It has no control of our borders and it has no control of the economy, and families are ultimately the ones who have suffered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will repeat the comments that Senator Eggleston made when he said: 'Why should families be responsible for this government's refusal or inability to do anything about properly protecting our borders?' This so-called Malaysian deal, which will cost close to $300 million, is a complete and utter farce. There is not one person in the Australian community who believes that it is going to resolve the situation. The solution is there, as Senator Eggleston said, with Nauru. It is quite simple. The Prime Minister knows that, the Labor Party backbench knows that, but the Prime Minister will not swallow her pride, admit she has made a mistake and get on and do something about it. Why should the Australian community pay for her refusal to acknowledge the mistakes that she has made? Why should they pay for her ego? Why should they continue to pay for her refusal to protect Australian families and to ease these increasing cost-of-living pressures?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government had an opportunity to do something significant for this country in last night's budget. But, instead, they have put every single egg of every single Australian family in the basket of the Chinese economy. This is a Chinese economy driven budget—and if there is a sneeze in the Chinese economy we will get a very, very serious does of the flu. Not one economic or political commentator thinks for one minute that there will not be a sneeze in the Chinese community. It beggars belief that in the next three years there will not be a shiver in the Chinese economy. No-one for one minute thinks that the Chinese economy is at risk, but no-one believes that there will not be some— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  This is the 17th budget that I have witnessed as a member of this parliament. I arrived here at the time of the budget in 1994. So I have seen a lot of budgets—both Labor ones and coalition ones. And let me tell you something: the history of this country shows that when the country gets into some trouble you have to go to a Labor government to get us out of it. It happened in World War II—you fell apart and John Curtin had to take over to save the country. It was Chifley, of course, who started to rebuild the Australian economy after World War II and it was the Hawke and Keating governments that transformed this economy and opened it up to the world—and today we see the great benefits of those visionary decisions. hat have we had in the last couple of years? We have had the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression. What do we have in Australia? We have an economy that is the envy of the Western world. We have the only economy in all of those great nations that did not go into recession. We have an economy that has low unemployment, that has a low inflation rate and that has one of the lowest government-debt-to-GDP ratios of the world. We are a country with an economy that did not have all of the crises that we continue to see in Europe, in countries like Spain, Greece, Ireland and so on. Why was that? It was because of the great economic management of the Rudd and Gillard governments, through, as I said, the worst economic crisis this world has seen since the 1930s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is as if the opposition thinks that it did not occur—because we fixed it, or because we made sure that our economy did not suffer in the way those other nations did. Senator Ronaldson talks about how when China sneezes we get a cold. A couple of years ago the world had one of the worst cases of economic flu in the history of the world in this century and the last century, but we did not catch a cold. We did not even sneeze, and that was because of the decisions taken by the Labor government at the time, decisions which those on the other side opposed. You opposed the economic stimulus package which ensured that our people stayed in work and that our economy continued to grow. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we hear the latest pronouncement on this budget. Senator Ronaldson just rattled off his problems as if he thinks this is the worst budget in history—as somebody over there said. It is not. This is a budget for the times. This is a budget that delivers some real increases in important services and important programs to this country, to areas, like mental health, that people have been screaming about for years. I served on a Senate select committee where we made recommendations for increased funding to mental health. I acknowledge that the Howard government did belatedly do something about it, but we have now put another $2.2 billion into that area. That is one of the most vital areas and it has been crying out for government support. Other changes we have made clearly will benefit many Australian families, particularly in terms of getting more people into the workforce.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget has also had to have some savings cuts in it, because we are still going to meet that target to get this budget back into surplus by the next financial year, 2012-13. Those cuts are important. But what do we get from the opposition? On the one hand, as Minister Wong said, the opposition says that it will just happen. They say they will just take us back into surplus if they were in government. But, as Senator Wong also pointed out, Mr Hockey is saying he will not support any of these savings cuts. What are you going to cut? Tell us the areas you are going to cut. You have an opportunity tomorrow night to tell the Australian parliament and the Australian people in what areas you will find the savings in government spending? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you were in government, govern­ment spending grew by an average of three per cent. Under the Rudd and Gillard governments it has been growing at one per cent, so do not lecture us about wasteful government spending and all the rest of it. This is a terrific budget for the times and for the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  Before I correct Senator Forshaw's attempt to rewrite history, I want to congratulate Senator Wong, who, together with the Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, has been responsible for putting Australia in a position where we now borrow $135 million each and every day. We pay something like $18 million to $20 million every day in interest on those monies that Labor keeps borrowing. In the time we have had question time today, Labor has borrowed another $5.6 million—ticking it up on the credit card. That is something like $92,000 a minute. While I am speaking today, Labor will have borrowed something like $500,000—in the five minutes I have today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Forshaw reminded us of the Keating days. What he forgot to tell us is that, when we took government in 1996, we found a $10 billion deficit that had been hidden by the Keating government out of that year's budget alone. When we looked at the books, we found that there was a $96 billion deficit run up by Labor's prolific spending, Labor's incapacity to run a country without taxing, spending and borrowing. It took the Howard government something like seven or eight years to pay off Labor's $96 billion debt. We did that through a lot of hard work and here we are a couple of years later with another Labor debt of in excess of $100 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder they moved Senator Wong from climate change; they should move her from this as well, because she is completely incapable. She talks about what a great economy Australia has. Australia used to have a great economy. Why? Because John Howard and Peter Costello paid off Labor's $96 billion debt and then put us into a $50 billion to $60 billion surplus, which in two short years Labor has blown and run us into additional debt of over $100 billion. Sure, we had a great economy. It was recorded by I think it was the OECD as the miracle economy of the world when it was under the control of Peter Costello and John Howard. Now we are rapidly moving down to the bottom. As one of my colleagues interjected on the GDP, Labor would have us try and emulate those countries who are in debt to the extent of 90 per cent of GDP. It is not, can I say to Senator Wong, a race to the bottom. As I look through this budget I see very little for rural, remote and regional Australia and I see absolutely nothing for agriculture. The minister sits in the chamber—he should hang his head in shame. There is no new money whatsoever for agriculture. We have a cutback in the Defence budget of some $4.3 billion over four years. At least the Defence budget puts a bit of money into rural and regional Australia, but that is being slashed by this government. Dealing with asylum seekers, as one of my colleagues has mentioned, has eaten up $2.5 billion over five years out of this budget, due to Labor's incapacity and inability to manage it properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note with some amusement the money allocated for the NBN rollout. I wonder where the 'private investment'—which was so lauded by Senator Conroy prior to the NBN starting—is. I see in the budget papers some reference to 'infrastructure bonds', but you ask them about it, you say, 'What are these about?' and nobody wants to talk about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />This is a budget from a weak, indecisive government who simply cannot be trusted to manage Australia's economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e6c" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WORTLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  As the minister pointed out, last night the Treasurer delivered a budget that aims to put the opportunities that flow from a strong economy within reach of more Australians. It is a budget that aims to get more people into work and to train them for more rewarding jobs. We know Australia emerged strongly from the global recession, with hundreds of thousands of jobs created, while around the world we saw record unemployment and the enormous social consequences it triggered. As the Treasurer pointed out last night, our public debt is a tiny fraction of that carried by comparable economies and our fiscal position is the envy of the developed world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have sat in this chamber and heard those opposite—and I was listening earlier to Senator Nash and, just now, to Senator Macdonald—talk about regional Australia. I would like to point out a few facts. The 2011-12 budget will invest a record $3.7 billion over the next 12 months in renewing and extending road, rail and aviation infrastructure across regional Australia—a sum far greater than anything ever provided before. Compared to what was spent in the last full year of the Howard government, we will be providing more than twice as much regional infrastructure funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest budget figures should make the National Party feel particularly uncom­fortable about their record in government because they again confirm that, when it comes to regional infrastructure, Labor governments deliver more than coalition governments. The choice for regional Australia is clear: a record infrastructure budget under federal Labor or cuts and the shelving of nation-building projects such as the NBN with Mr Abbott and his mates in the Nationals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other areas of interest include the mental health package. There was a fantastic contribution there. The mental health reform package, of $2.2 billion over five years, will improve the lives of thousands of Australians with mental illness and their families, providing more intensive support services and better coordinating those services for people with severe and persistent mental illness who have complex care needs. It targets support to areas and communities that need it most, such as Indigenous commun­ities and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas that are underserviced by the system as it is today. It will help to detect potential mental health problems in the early years and support young people who struggle with mental illness. Given the impact of mental illness on individuals, their families and the community, the Gillard government believes mental health reform should be a priority. That belief is reflected in the funding provided in what is a very responsible budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also builds on the government's strong record of lifting educational standards. Over three years, $200 million will be invested to support students with disabilities in their classrooms and to improve their learning outcomes. This package applies to students with a disability in our government, Catholic and independent schools and includes new services such as speech and occupational therapy delivered at schools, additional hours of in-class support and access to specialist equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 2012, students from years 9 to 12 will be offered a new national trade cadetship as an option under the Australian Curriculum. This cadetship will be delivered through local trades training centres and other eligible venues. Up to 50,000 additional structured work experience places will also be provided to students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians, regardless of their background or where they live, should have the opportunity to gain a university education. Labor is investing a further $1.4 billion to meet the growth in university enrolments. We will see 480,000 under­graduate places funded this year. A fund will be created to upgrade infrastructure at regional tertiary institutions and to assist universities to support, attract and retain students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs are another important issue. Training a bigger workforce is vital for the strength of the economy and the living standards of our community. The 2011-12 budget invests in education, apprenticeships, jobs and training. This government is delivering the skilled workers our economy needs while ensuring more Australians benefit from our growing prosperity. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>)</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>): Well, I have heard everything! If nothing is the responsibility of this government then for some reason they will claim credit for everything. The conceit on the part of this government—claiming credit, as we have heard from previous speakers, for the resilience of the Australian economy over the last three or four years! The conceit to say that all the small business people who worked harder and all the people that took reduced hours contributed nothing! The conceit of this government to think that it controls the economy and that the success of the economy belongs solely to it is unbounded. e know this from the last 70 years of economics. While I am a big fan of the writer that wrote about the 'fatal conceit', the point is that this government only claims credit for those things it wishes to. It seeks to avoid responsibility and makes excuses for those issues it wants to avoid. It says we should compare Australia's debt to that of other nations. I have never heard a successful defence when a bank comes to repossess a house or business being based on, 'My neighbour owes more.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is ridiculous to compare the success of the Australian economy and the massive run-up in debt that we have experienced over the last three years with what is happening in other parts of the world because, quite frankly, they are profoundly mismanaged. Unlike those governments in other parts of the world, this government did not inherit a mismanaged economy. It inherited the most sound finances of any government in the Western world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government does not want to tell you is that, while the average debt in Australia is lower than some of our competitors, if we look at other countries we have had the third fastest run-up of public debt in the OECD over the last five years. You have got the bronze medal there. I suppose you are going for gold very soon if we keep up this record of 20 per cent explosions over six months in budget deficits. In one year this government has run up half the debt that was repaid by 10 years of the previous government. That is $50 billion of debt in one year—up by $10 billion in six months. The children of Australia are never going to see a debt-free Commonwealth if this government stays in office. I fear for the work that will have to be undertaken, the difficult decisions and the sacrifices that will have to be made, if this government stays in office much longer. It has run up $50 billion—half of the previous debt of the Commonwealth that was repaid in a decade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At its core is a profound misunderstanding of the Australian economy. Yes, the Australian Commonwealth does not have as much debt as some other nations. If we look at net public sector debt around Australia and the behaviour of our state governments, we have a fairly significant debt level in Australia. All this, due to the terms of the Loan Council provisions in the Constitution, is effectively guaranteed by Australian taxpayers. Let us not just look at the Commonwealth balance sheet; let us look at what is happening in the states to see what Australian taxpayers are really up for. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we have had historically low public debt in Australia since the coalition paid it back, we have incredibly high private debt. Our private banks are dependent upon levels of funding on a regular basis from overseas that, quite frankly, their competitors in the private sector banking systems of other countries are not dependent on. You do not need to be an economist to know that the only reason our four big banks could continue to access the funds they needed for functioning during the credit-squeeze phase of the global financial crisis was that, even though their debt position was safe, the Australian financial system was regarded as strong—that there was indeed a strong net financial position for the Commonwealth of Australia. You cannot have a situation where both of your private banks are dependent on massive borrowings from overseas. You cannot have a situation where you are a capital-importing country having regular levels of foreign investment from overseas and at the same time are continuing to run up Commonwealth debt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is going to sink without trace. This government looks at the next three years and says it is not increasing spending. It is like an alcoholic saying 'I am not having a drink today' after a three-day binge, because in the last few years spending has increased by more than 15 per cent, in real terms. This government will stand condemned for its mismanagement and run-up of debt in Australia.</span>

                    </a>  The coal-seam gas proposals in Australia, like those in the United States, Russia and elsewhere around the world, are simply mind-bending. There is a proposal for 40,000 gas wells to be sunk on the Darling Downs, one of the world's premier food lands, alone. There are now proposals for 550 such gas wells in the Pilliga Scrub woodland near Narrabri in New South Wales. We know that there is a proposal for a gas well at Petersham, right in the heart of metropolitan Sydney, and there are other proposals breaking out all over Australia. The concern about this is that not only would these proposals compromise some of the best farm and food producing lands in the country but they offer a direct threat to the groundwater systems, because they involve going through the groundwater systems into coal seams underneath and extracting methane under various measures—the worst of which is fracking, which involves the use of carcinogenic chemicals which have caused pandemonium in the United States. One only has to read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Times </span>of this last weekend to see the extreme concern that is being expressed in Pennsylvania, for one. I am amazed that the big parties, and in particular the National Party, have voted against an inquiry into coal-seam gas in this country. I am amazed that there could be such a deliberate subservience to these corporations that the Senate has denied the opportunity for there to be a proper inquiry.</span>

The government notes that it has already made a commitment to the member for New England, who chairs the Regional Australia Committee, to investigate coal-seam gas mining. In this capacity the Commonwealth will support that inquiry which will include some of the relevant matters that Senator Brown's motion refers to.</span>

I do note the fracture that is developing between the National Party and the Liberal Party on this issue, though.</span>

                    </a>  I wish to say in my statement that this is a very controversial issue. It was raised prior to the state election in New South Wales of 26 March. The then shadow minister handling this portfolio on this issue was the Hon. Duncan Gay, now Minister for Roads and Ports. Mr Gay put his coalition policy forward, which was endorsed by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament, prior to the election. The Greens supported the coalition and the National Party-led policy that the states are responsible on this very issue about exploration and mining rights. It was a very protective way the National Party put that policy forward, supported by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament. We have an inquiry into this under the Rural Affairs and Transport Committee. Senator Brown would probably like to have two to waste more taxpayers' money, because he does not understand budgets. We see that as a waste of money. The issue is being handled by the Rural Affairs and Transport Committee led by Senator Heffernan as chair. The inquiry will be carried out. We know how important it is to protect these areas, especially the underground water in these very prime agricultural areas. We support the inquiry totally. There is one running now. I have told you, Mr Deputy President, about the National Party in the New South Wales parliament in conjunction with our coalition partners led by Premier Barry O'Farrell and the policy announced prior to the election that was supported by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament. This is simply a political wedge by Senator Brown, trying to cause trouble. We support the inquiry and we will go with the inquiry that is already established.</span>

This was put in the notice of motion for the rural committee on the Murray-Darling Basin inquiry as the coal seam side to it. The debate in the community is well developed. I agree there are serious issues, which include health and the issue of fracking. It has locked up in the courts for 20 years a lot of serious potential and we will certainly be dealing with every aspect of it in the coming weeks, starting in the Dalby and Gunnedah areas.</span>

                  </a>  It is one of those matters which is a longstanding foreign affairs issue. The government has a longstanding practice of not dealing with complex foreign policy matters through Senate motions. The government does not support boycotts that impede legitimate trade between states and has expressed its strong opposition to the Marrickville council's earlier proposed boycotts, disinvestment and sanctions campaign against Israel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion moved by the Senator Abetz does appear to be more concerned with politics than expressing support for Israel. I ask Senator Abetz if he would care to explain to the Senate why at the last federal election the Liberal Party directed preferences to Greens candidates in New South Wales, in particular why the Liberal Party directed preferences to Sam Byrne, the Greens candidate for Grayndler, which covers Marrickville council. But without turning this into the politics that Senator Abetz has expressed, the longstanding practice really highlights the issue that I have indicated—that is, they are complex foreign policy matters and on that basis it has been long practice that we do not support this motion.</span>

I did previously circulate a motion which simply referred to the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian people. That is not correct in the sense that the blockade is confined, if you want to use that word, to Gaza. But if we are going to move this motion, it is important to also state as a matter of fact the impact on the Palestinians in Gaza in terms of the blockade. I did give notice earlier to my colleagues, as soon as I could, but I do seek to move from the floor an amendment to the motion to put at the end of Senator Abetz's motion. I move:</span>

This is a motion relating solely to the BDS situation—that is, the boycotts, divestment and sanctions policy against Israel. Senator Xenophon is now trying to introduce other extraneous matters not directly relevant to the motion and, interestingly enough, on a technical point, it is interesting that Senator Xenophon sees the need to note the detrimental effect of the Israeli blockade on the people of Gaza, but allegedly the Egyptian blockade on the people of Gaza can be completely ignored and that is the evil of the BDS policy because what it seeks to do—</span>

On 23 March this year it was not a complex issue. What has made it complex for the Australian Labor Party is that they are unable to justify why so many of their affiliated unions, and indeed the state division of the Labor Party, of which their foreign minister, Mr Rudd, is a member, have passed motions in support of this objectionable policy.</span>

That is why the BDS policy that the Greens have been promoting is so wrong: it only seeks to condemn Israel and not Egypt. Why don't we have a BDS policy on Egypt courtesy of the Greens, especially from New South Wales? Why doesn't that concern Senator Xenophon?</span>

We are dealing with the evil of the BDS policy which Senator Bob Brown himself has finally come to reject in the wake of the New South Wales state election where one of the Green candidates clearly did not win a seat against Labor because of that policy. I say to the people of New South Wales, 'Well done!' </span>

The Labor Party did and put Fiona Byrne at No. 2 on the how-to-vote card in the state election, so please do not come in here and try to lecture and hector us. I know it is embarrassing for certain elements in this place that the anti-Israel stance being taken by some political parties and groups, such as trade unions, does need to be opposed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Clearly the blockade, whether it is by Israel or Egypt, on Gaza and the impact on the Palestinian people is something that is causing detriment and that should be noted. That was the intent of the motion. I seek your guidance, Mr Deputy President, as to whether I can withdraw my previous amendment and move another amendment which would incorporate Egypt as well as Israel in terms of the blockade.

                  </a>  I draw the Senate back to the terrific circumstances which have led to this debate both in Marrickville in the New South Wales elections and now in this great parliament—that is, the unhealed sore of the disputes, the violence, the continuing death toll and the harrowing circumstances of people living in Palestine and in Israel and, indeed, in other parts of the Middle East.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is our job to think about it and to debate it. We should not merely find ourselves fighting over it. We should also find some way of actually helping more than the world has helped in the past to ensure the security of the people of Israel and their right to live in peace into the future as well as the right of the people of Palestine to have their own country with equal security to chart their own future in the same way as the rest of the world does. It is incredibly important that we try to limit in the future the violence that we have seen in the past from both sides and to give a peace dividend to the whole region by having those two peoples living in peace with each other. Maybe we should set aside a full and open debate at some stage in this chamber to talk about just that. They deserve it, and we deserve to do it in a constructive way that would end in a peace which would in turn make all of us on this planet a bit more secure and happy.</span>

                  </a>  Or his proposition; I think it was an invitation as well as a proposition, Senator Siewert. The position is this: there is no doubt, on the basis of the discussions I have had with members of the Palestinian community and the friends of Palestine here in Australia, that both the Egyptian and the Israeli blockades have had an enormous impact on Palestinians who are completely innocent of any involvement with Hamas. The effect on children and on the supply of medicines is quite profound. I note that the Israeli government says that they have instituted the blockade in response to the role of Hamas; but things such as pasta, pencils and stationery have been blockaded. So I think that the blockade goes well beyond issues of security.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel comfortable about supporting this motion if this amendment is passed, but I do not support the blockade of Israel that has been proposed by, I think, the New South Wales Greens and by some in the Labor Party. I think that is completely unacceptable, and I want that to be on the record; but in the context of this motion I believe it to be appropriate that we acknowledge the impact of the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian people. That in itself should not be seen as an endorsement in any way whatsoever of a terrorist organisation such as Hamas; instead it is about the impact of the blockade on innocent Palestinians and the very deep detrimental effects on those Palestinians.</span>

This is not the correct process of discovering formal business.</span>

                  </a>  The coalition senators will not support this motion, not so much because of what it says as because of the stench of hypocrisy which surrounds it. At the last federal election, the efficiency dividend was a very big issue in the ACT. The coalition proposed, as members will know, a two per cent efficiency dividend across the Public Service. The Labor Party and the Greens strongly opposed this. In fact, the ALP said that, if elected, it would tolerate no increase in the efficiency dividend applying to the Public Service.</span>

                  </a>  I will speak more loudly. A few days ago, of course, the government announced, courtesy of Senator Wong, that it was breaking that election promise and increasing the efficiency dividend from 1¼ per cent to 1½ per cent. I put that on the record because broken promises from this government are now so frequent that they are not even newsworthy anymore. We know that both major parties at the last election proposed to reduce the cost of the Public Service, but of course only the coalition was prepared to be honest about its intentions. Labor also said in the last few days that it would save cultural institutions by providing that the dividend did not necessarily apply to small institutions like the cultural institutions, but in the budget tabled last night the budgets of those institutions were all reduced on account of the increased dividend.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brown and his Greens closely supported the Labor Party's campaign in the ACT against the coalition's proposals, and now Senator Brown's Greens support the government and their budget by guaranteeing supply. The hypocrisy inherent in this motion is breathtaking, and for that reason the coalition senators will not support it.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. I will not respond in kind but will try to be a bit more informative to the chamber than the submission we have just heard from Senator Humphries. But let me say at the outset that, had we supported the coalition into govern­ment, the cuts to these institutions now through a bigger dividend would be even more destructive to the cultural institutions here in the national capital and elsewhere in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that escapes Senator Humphries here is that, yes, the Greens have guaranteed to ensure supply—and we will, because that is a responsible contribution to the welfare of this country and that is what voters would expect of us—but it does not mean that all the detail of a budget into which we had no effective input has to be accepted. If we can find a means through good argument and a strong approach to the government to take the burden of cuts from the great art and cultural institutions then we will do that, and if we cannot then we will look at other means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware that, for example, the cuts to the National Gallery may mean that five or six hugely publicly wanted exhibitions will not occur in the next 12 months and that there will be a couple of dozen, if not more, people losing their jobs at that institution, to the great detriment of the cultural wellbeing of this whole nation. It is just an example of why we should not be doing this. I hope Senator Humphries will join me in seeking to influence the government to alter this component of the budget for the wellbeing of the institutions and the people of Australia as a whole. </span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. The coalition will be supporting this motion. The desperate deal announced by the Prime Minister shows that this government will pay any price and do any deal, no matter how one-sided, to avoid implementing the proven policies of the coalition. The deal that has been struck by the Prime Minister is a desperate stop-gap deal with Malaysia, with the use-by date of just 800 arrivals. At the current rate of arrivals this will last just a few months, with no renewal. The five-for-one swap proposed by the Prime Minister is a deal that shows that the Malaysians clearly saw the Prime Minister of Australia coming and shows just how politically desperate this government has become.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's dealing in Asia shows that, under her prime ministership, Australia is now the junior partner in the region. Because of the Labor government's border protection policy failures Australia is now negotiating from a position of weakness. When you negotiate from a position of weakness you end up with a deal that has been struck—one which will in no way benefit Australia. This Malaysian deal is a panicked announcement from a government that is yet again proving it is directionless, untrustworthy and incompetent. The deal will cover about 12 boats and after that it will be back to business as usual under Labor because Labor have no permanent plans to deal with the mess they have created on our borders and in our detention centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's announcement makes a mockery of the government's rejection of Nauru on the grounds that they are not a signatory to the UN convention on refugees, as Malaysia is also not a signatory. This government will adopt any excuse to avoid the proven policies of the coalition. If the Prime Minister wants to send a tough message to people smugglers, there is one thing and one thing alone that she can do: reinstate the policies of the Howard government. They worked and the statistics show that they were proven to work.</span>

                <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I think the subject of the matter of public importance bears repeating:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Gillard government's decision in this Budget to be tough on Australian families, rather than tough on itself with a new assault on families that are already struggling under cost of living pressures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think there has ever been a government that is so reticent to take difficult decisions, that is so timid and so hidebound by its own electoral self-interest, that it does not take the decisions necessary for the national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">'The national interest' is a phrase that you will hear Labor members and senators use over and over. Any half-baked idea, any act of political self-interest, will always be followed by the phrase 'because this is in the national interest', as though those are magic words—you use the phrase 'national interest' and it transforms self-interested policies in the eyes of the electorate into worthwhile policies. Whenever we hear those words 'national interest' from the Labor Party we know that it is anything but.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party used to tell us all the time that they were the party for families. They used to say that they were the party for workers. That then morphed into the 'party for families' and then you could not turn on the television in 2007 without hearing a Labor MP drone on about 'working families'. We care about working families, but for the Labor Party it is a mantra. It is a focus-group tested mantra which they think will convince the voting public. But what has changed between 2007 and now? Labor did profess to care about working families and Labor have now cast away that commitment to working families. There was no mention of working families in the budget. Given the measures in the budget, it was a little too much even for the Labor Party to talk about a commitment to working families—such would be the hypocrisy if they did that. Indeed, not only has the budget neglected families, it has absolutely potted them, with a raft of measures that are going to make things worse for families. e know that Australian families are facing severe cost-of-living pressures due to Labor's profligacy and waste. Electricity prices are up 51 per cent since Labor was elected; grocery prices are up by 14 per cent; education and health costs are up by about 20 per cent; and there have been no fewer than seven interest rate rises in a row, increasing average mortgage repayments by over $500 a month.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not asserting that every one of those cost-of-living increases is the direct result of Labor policies. Some of them are. Some of those cost-of-living pressures have been exacerbated by Labor policies. But, surely, it is the job of government firstly, when it comes to the Australian people, to seek to do no harm. This government has exacerbated those cost-of-living pressures and has made it even harder for families to meet those in this budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">So, instead of trying to fix this problem, Labor's budget has cut support for families and it has hit them with new and higher taxes. The budget strips $2 billion from families by freezing for three years the indexation of key family tax payments and income thresholds. It also slugs families and businesses with $6 billion of new and increased taxes. To make matters worse, Australian families are yet to be hit by the Gillard-Brown carbon tax. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of taking the opportunity that this budget presented to end months of uncertainty around the carbon tax, the budget fails to give any details of the carbon tax or its impact on living costs or jobs. We know that all the budget forecasts will be thrown out the window when the government finally does get around to releasing the details of the carbon tax. I guess they will have to release some sort of mid-year economic forecast to update all of those effects. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As Tony Abbott has said many, many times, the budget is not worth the paper that it is written on, because it does not include the biggest macroeconomic so-called reform. Not everything a government does is a reform. But this government calls it a 'reform'; it is a misnomer. The budget does not include that significant macroeconomic reform that they claim.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's failure to rein in reckless and wasteful spending is going to lead to high inflation. It is going to put upward pressure on interest rates. That is going to see more interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank—we know that. But just at the time that families are being slugged by increases in interest rates, they will be in a worse position because there will be the freezing of indexation of key family tax benefits which are usually indexed to the CPI, so it is a double whammy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also frozen the indexation of the higher income thresholds for family payments for the next three years. These thresholds are usually indexed by the CPI. These thresholds are to be frozen, and they include the $150,000 limit for FTBB, the $75,000 baby bonus eligibility limit for family income, the $150,000 paid parental leave income limit and the higher income threshold for FTBA. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also the first budget in eight years that has not provided tax cuts for Australians. Instead, as I have mentioned before, Labor has hit Australian families and the economy with more than $6 billion in new and higher taxes. Labor are still determined to means test the private health insurance rebate to hurt families. Labor have been tough on families because they have failed to be tough on themselves. I want to evidence that. There is a thread that runs through and joins each Labor budget. There is an unerring constancy and a consistency of approach. They are undoubtedly works of fiction. I have those works of fiction here: the 2008-09 budget, a work of fiction; the 2009-10 budget, a work of fiction; the 2010-11 budget, a work of fiction; and the most recent work of fiction, the 2011-12 budget, another work of fiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to detail what I mean. Let's go back to 2008, the first budget by Mr Swan, when he said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">We are budgeting for a surplus of $21.7 billion in 2008</span>
                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:MS Mincho;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‑</span>
                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">09, 1.8 per cent of GDP, the largest budget surplus as a share of GDP in nearly a decade.</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">An opposition senator:</span>  Yeah, right! </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="D2I" type="MemberContinuation">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FIFIELD:</span>
                </a>  'Yeah, right' indeed! What was the outcome of that budget? It wasn't a $21.7 billion surplus; it was a $27.079 billion deficit. So, there is another work of fiction. If you look hard in 2009-10 budget, you will not actually find the forecasted deficit, so embarrassed was Mr Swan. The outcome was a $54 billion deficit. In the 2010-11 budget—and these numbers actually get further back in the budget speech as you go—Mr Swan said the budget deficit would be $40.8 billion for 2010-11. It ended up being $49 billion. Now we have the final work of fiction, which says that there will be a deficit for 2011-12 of $22.6 billion. I am guessing it might actually be a bit bigger.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government actually did something extremely helpful: they changed the colour of the budget papers, so now it is really easy to work out what is a surplus budget and what is a deficit budget. The last Costello budget, as all the Costello budgets were, is white in colour—a surplus budget. Wayne Swan, very kindly changed the colour of the budget paper to blue so we can now easily tell. Any blue budget paper is a deficit budget. That was very thoughtful, Mr Swan. Thank you for doing that.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the exhibits to support the case that Labor are not tough on themselves. They are clearly not. They always take the soft option. I just want to touch on a few comments of Mr Swan over the last few days. He said yesterday that the opposition is set to wreck the surplus. There is no surplus, and any good psychologist will tell you that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. I do not believe there will be a surplus. Mr Swan yesterday said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I've done a lot of things Peter Costello has never done.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">He is spot on. Peter Costello: 12 budgets and 10 surpluses; Wayne Swan: four budgets, four deficits and no surpluses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Penny Wong yesterday said this is a typical Labor budget. You bet it is—debt and deficit, with no tough decisions, and at the same time slugging ordinary Australians. If you listen to Senator Wong, she will tell you that they have really had a lot of bad luck, that overwhelmingly it is revenue shortfalls that have led to these budget deficits. That is not true. The overwhelming majority of the reasons for the budget deficits have been policy decisions by government. If you look at the reasons for the budget deficits, they are policy decisions by government, not revenue shortfalls. But if you listen to Senator Wong and Mr Swan you will believe that no government has ever had such a bad run of luck as this outfit has.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, the Labor Party, claimed at the 2007 election that they would be economic conservatives. They have not been. This has been a government of sloth, waste and incompetence. The people who are paying the price for that are the Australian public, and this budget stands as a testament to the fact that the Australian Labor Party are not tough on themselves; they cannot take a tough decision. It is always the Australian people who pay. They are paying again. They are suffering from rising costs of living. This budget will exacerbate those costs of living. Every budget tells the story of deceit. Every budget tells the story that it is the Australian Labor Party, through their bad policy decisions, who are inflicting pain on the Australian people.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  What an appalling matter of public importance brought on by Senator Fifield. It is appalling because it feeds into the campaign of fearmongering that the federal opposition continues to engage in. It is absolutely breathtaking in its hypocrisy. Another day, another scare campaign. The opposition are trying to tell us how to budget when they brought forward election costings with an $11 billion black hole. Being criticised by the opposition on fiscal responsibility is like being flogged with a feather duster. I would sooner take marriage guidance lessons from Tiger Woods than I would take lessons in accounting from those opposite!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The other great hypocrisy is that, if there was ever an assault on families, it has been perpetrated by the coalition. Let's look at their record. They talk about Work Choices being dumped and yet they come up with a workplace relations policy that revives the worst elements of Work Choices. They talk about cost of living pressures and last year they proposed a levy that would feed through to the cost of every grocery item at Coles and Woolworths. They talk about the effects of a carbon price and then they come up with a so-called 'direct action' plan which will cost the average family $720 a year and will blow a $30 billion black hole in the budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">While the opposition perpetrates its attacks on families, the Gillard Labor government is actually delivering for families in this budget. The family assistance measures in this budget build on the $46.7 billion we have already delivered in income tax cuts. A person earning $50,000 a year pays $1,750 less tax now than they paid in 2007. The budget also builds on the family assistance we have delivered through the education tax refund, the childcare rebate, our teen dental plan and pension reforms. And through the budget we continue to deliver on skills and jobs, after making our workplace laws fairer and simpler and tearing up Work Choices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I will outline just a few of the initiatives that are helping Australian families through this budget—just in case Senator Fifield missed them. We are providing a $296.3 million boost to provide more community based support for people with mental illness and their families. We are providing $147 million through the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, which will give children with disability affecting their development better access to early intervention services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are trialling new measures in disadvantaged communities to help teenage parents to finish school and support their children. These measures will break the cycle of disadvantage experienced by some families. For vulnerable and disadvantaged Australians we are making investments in financial counselling, emergency relief and other money management initiatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The headline initiatives for families are our changes to the family payments system. At the same time as making the system fairer, simpler and more sustainable in the long term, we are providing more support for low- and middle-income families raising children. From 1 January this year, family tax benefit part A will be increased for 16- to 17-year-olds in secondary school by $4,208 per year and for 18- to 19-year-olds in school by $3,741 per year. This measure will benefit the families of 650,000 teenagers. We will also give families access to more flexible advance payments of family tax benefit part A.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">At the core of this budget is the one thing that helps Australian families more than anything else, and that is the dignity and financial independence that comes with getting a job. Since coming to government in 2007, Labor has created well over 700,000 jobs, and we intend to build on this success. The Gillard Labor government is investing $3 billion over six years in skilling the Australian workforce. We are also delivering a package of participation reforms to make sure that more Australians have the opportunity to engage in the workforce. This includes a workforce development fund to deliver 130,000 training places over four years, a national mentoring program to help 40,000 apprentices finish training, and investment in more flexible training models to allow apprentices to be fast-tracked as they acquire critical trade skills.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are providing additional investment in the national partnership with the states and territories to boost vocational education and training. We are reforming the disability support pension and providing more support for DSP recipients to participate in work. We are extending our 'earn or learn' requirements to 21-year-olds and creating new pathways to full-time employment for early school leavers. We are investing in targeted wage subsidies and extended work experience programs to help the long-term unemployed into work. Now let me go to the issue of a carbon price, because there are a couple of things the opposition conveniently overlooks in its commentary on this. First of all, the carbon price is not going to be included in the budget because the design is yet to be finalised. It will not affect the budget bottom line because the measure is expected to be revenue neutral. However, one member of the opposition who is sceptical about that claim put in one of the best comical performances I have ever seen on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> last Sunday morning. I am referring to the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey. For those who missed it, here is the transcript:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JOE HOCKEY: Well on budget night when they claim to deliver a surplus in 2012/13 there will be a gaping hole and the hole will be the carbon tax ...</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">BARRIE CASSIDY: It's true that the carbon tax figures won't be there but isn't it generally accepted that the figures will be broadly neutral in that first year?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JOE HOCKEY: No, because revenue will be higher.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hockey claims that the government's carbon price will make it more difficult to deliver a surplus in 2012-13 and then five seconds later he claims that revenue from the carbon price will be higher than expenditure. Can the opposition please make up their minds on this one? If one member of your caucus has two views, it is no wonder you have trouble coming up with any sensible policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The other salient fact that the opposition choose to ignore when they start their big scare campaign on cost of living pressures is that this is a tax on big polluters. While we accept that there will be some price increases, we have committed to at least 50 per cent of the revenue from a carbon price going to household assistance, a measure that we expect will fully compensate many Australians and will leave millions of Australians better off.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to supporting families, this government's record is second to none. The opposition likes to try to scare families because it suits its political purpose, but the scariest prospect for families would be if Tony Abbott became Prime Minister. We must not forget that if Tony Abbott had his way there would be an $11 billion black hole in the budget and 200,000 Australians would be out of work because of his opposition to the economic stimulus plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the pressures that Australian families are under. We have just been through a global financial crisis and, despite Australia's resilience, we have all felt the effects. But this Gillard Labor government is supporting families, supporting skills and jobs and supporting strong and responsible fiscal management that will return the budget to surplus by 2012-13.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know Mr Abbott has a knack of getting the big economic calls wrong. Just look at his approach to the global financial crisis, the flood recovery package and his so-called health reform. The big risk to Australian families is the opposition, just as it is a big risk to the budget and a risk to our $1.3 trillion economy.</span>

                <a href="I0V" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  Senator Bilyk said this Gillard Labor government is committed to fiscal restraint and fiscal responsibility, but we are yet to see a budget in the black. This matter of public importance today about the harm this government is causing to our families and to their cost of living is simply a free kick in front of goal for us on the opposition benches.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to look at the history of the Labor Party. Senator Cormann pointed out to me last night what happened in the 13 years of the Hawke-Keating government. How many budget surpluses were there? Just three out of 13. It was borrow, borrow, borrow—and run up the debt. We know the debt. It was $96 billion inherited by the Howard coalition government. They had some 10 or 11 years to pay it off. We can go back to the late eighties and the early nineties and look at the way the Labor Party managed the states. Victoria had a $60 billion debt and down the tube it went. South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania were similar.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="I0N" type="MemberInterjecting">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Farrell:</span>
                </a>  That's not true!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="I0V" type="MemberContinuation">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WILLIAMS:</span>
                </a>  It is absolutely true. What happened to your bank in South Australia, Senator Farrell? It had to be cashed in to clean up some of your debt. It was all brought on by the Labor Party. It has not changed. On 26 March this year, there was a state election in New South Wales. I think those opposite would probably like to forget about that date. They should remember it. It was when the people of New South Wales really had their say on what they thought of that state's Labor administration after 16 years. And guess what: the Treasurer has now confirmed there is a $5 billion hole in the New South Wales budget and forward estimates. Does that surprise anyone? Not at all. All my life I have talked to people in the street and they say, 'Every time Labor gets into government they send us broke.' Nothing has changed; it is the same here.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us have a look at what is happening now. Senator Fifield pointed out earlier that this current financial year has a budget with some $41 billion deficit, and $9 billion has been added to that. There was $50 billion borrowed this year. It is amazing. Yesterday I looked on the website of the Australian Office of Financial Management. It stated that the debt was $187.7 billion and growing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I find the stimulus package amazing—the $42 billion stimulus waste that was brought forward to this parliament. That package had a section in it where the government could borrow up to $2 billion. That was the overdraft. I think we will have to extend the overdraft. If we are on $187.7 billion now, by the end of this month it will be $190 billion; yet next year's budget forecast is $22.6 billion. So it will be back to the parliament to extend the overdraft.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not only concern about the federal government's debt but also concern that this parliament has underwritten the states' debts for some $240 billion. If the federal government's gross debt goes to $220 billion and there is $240 billion for the states, we would be looking at a $460 billion debt between the states and the federal government of Australia. With a $1.3 trillion GDP, we will probably be looking at 40 per cent. It is only a guess.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The real problem is what this is going to do to working families. Remember that prior to the 2007 election it was all about working families. These are the same families that had $2 billion taken out of their family allowances in Mr Swan's budget last night. hat this means is higher interest rates. I have told the Senate before about the days of Treasurer Paul Keating. At one stage he was the so-called 'world's greatest treasurer'. For what—borrowing money and running up debt? We were paying an interest rate of 22.25 per cent on the farm. People cannot believe that today. It is a figure I will never forget, and I hope Senator Cameron does not forget it. We have now had seven interest rate rises. The cash rate was at three per cent but it is now at 4.75 per cent and there is more to come.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When interest rates go up, there are two effects. The Aussie battlers, those buying their home and trying to fulfil their dream, are the ones who will pay. People in small business, with their debts, will pay. The farmers, after eight years of drought and with many having their crops washed out over the summer months last year, will pay. That is what happens with interest rates. But the bad effect of all this is that the higher our interest rates go in Australia, the greater the difference between Australian interest rates and overseas rates. And then what happens? We have foreign investors investing in the higher rates in Australia and we have a stronger Australian dollar, and the stronger the Australian dollar gets, the more income is wiped out of regional Australia again. This is why, when the government say they are out to promote jobs and help unemployment, the higher interest rates and the higher Australian dollar are going to have a very negative effect on the future of our regional economies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What concerns me is that, for the next four years, the government's interest bill will be close to $20 million a day. That is quite amazing. Last night, when I was watching Sky TV, I saw the member for New England, Tony Windsor, saying, 'Don't be concerned about the deficit, it is really not a problem.' How far he has turned to the left since he has been in alliance with the Labor Party and the Greens!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the budget deficit growing and this is on top of increased taxes. First of all, there was the alcopops tax, then there was the car tax and then the flood tax. Soon there will be a mining tax and then there will be a carbon tax, the tax we were never going to have. We had a promise from Ms Gillard that, under any government she leads, there will be no carbon tax. And we had the magical words of Treasurer Swan on the hysterical accusation that if Labor won the election in August 2011 they would introduce a carbon tax. Of course, it is on the way. So that is the situation we face now.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to raise a smaller issue—it might not be big to people in here—and that is the funding of our cooperative research centres, which do all the research. Look out for cures for disease in animals, whether it be in the poultry industry, the pork industry, the sheepmeat industry, or in the cotton industry now that we have $33.4 million sliced out of the funding to our CRCs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="H6V" type="MemberInterjecting">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Boyce:</span>
                </a>  Oh, careful, they might've been productive!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="I0V" type="MemberContinuation">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WILLIAMS:</span>
                </a>  Exactly, Senator Boyce. I will take that interjection. They would be productive; they will increase productivity; they will lead to growing more food so that we can actually feed people. But, no, Treasurer Swan and the Labor Party take an axe to research and development in our regional centres and our rural and agricultural products. I find that simply amazing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ryan made this point earlier on. So many times we hear this comparison about Australia's debt in relation to many other countries: 'Well, it's not too bad really, there's nothing to worry about.' That is a furphy. Imagine if you were having trouble paying your mortgage, if you owed, say, $300,000 on your home loan. Does it make you feel better if the bloke down the road owes $400,000 or if the lady across the street owes $450,000? That does not help you to pay your debt any easier. The fact is that $18 million to $20 million a day, every day, seven days a week, is what we are going to have to pay in interest for the next four years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talks about the surplus. If there is a four per cent reduction in commodity prices, or a further increase in the exchange rate, there will be no surplus. As I said at the start of this debate, we had 13 years of Labor from 1983 to 1996 and we had three surpluses. We have had another four years of Labor from 2007 to 2011. That makes 17 years of Labor government and we have had just three surpluses. Borrow, borrow, spend, spend, and mortgage our children's futures away, and they call it economic and fiscal responsibility! It is reckless, it is wrong, and that is why the people of Australia are going to turn against this government in a big way. When interest rates rise—and, as sure as I speak, they will—and the exchange rate rises further as a result of that, we will see less income for our nation, more imports and the loss of jobs, and industries like cement, aluminium and steel will be affected. When we get the carbon tax that is when we are going to see it all come to a head. We will see exactly what that tax does to destroy jobs and destroy families' livelihoods.</span>

I am very happy to have the opportunity to place on record the benefits of the Gillard government's budget, a budget to ensure the long-term future of all Australians, and I congratulate Treasurer Wayne Swan on this budget. The Gillard government's budget of 2011-12 will strengthen the Australian economy, creating jobs and opportunities. We said this would be a tough budget, and it is. However, the Gillard government is delivering for Australian families with increased flexibility and fair and sustainable financial support. We will deliver a further $300 a year of the low-income tax offset into pay packets and not at the end of the year. Extra support is also being directed to families with an increase in family tax benefit part A of up to $4,208 per year for older teenagers and $3,741 per year for 18- and 19-year-olds in school. We understand the costs associated with raising children and we know that you cannot plan for unexpected expenses. For this reason we will be offering a $1,000 advance for family tax benefit part A to Australian families at any time to cover those unexpected costs. he government is providing more support for low- and middle-income families raising children through our election commitments to increase family assistance to support teenagers in school; making advance payments more flexible; and encouraging parents to get health checks for their children before they start school. Finding a way to include these important measures in a budget that makes a substantial saving to return to surplus in 2012-13 shows the strength and the discipline of the government's commitment to supporting Australian families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The FTB part A will only be available for families where their teenager is in full-time study, secondary study or vocational equivalent. This government is committed to ensuring Australian youth have access to the best possible educational opportunities. This funding is aimed at helping youth stay in school until at the least year 12. This government believes that having the building blocks for further education or vocational training is essential for the youth of Australia. The families of around 650,000 teenagers turning 16 over the next five years could benefit from substantial increases if the young person stays in school. Family tax benefit will be the primary payment for dependent full-time secondary students living at home. Youth allowance will continue to be available for those children who meet other eligibility criteria.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a budget that required us to make difficult choices and create savings where possible. However, our commitment to supporting Australian families is obvious. The Gillard government is committed to supporting families through increased funding aimed at education and training, placing industry at the heart of the training effort with a new $558 million National Workforce Development Fund. $233 million will be aimed at supporting the very long-term unemployed move back into employment through the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. Would the coalition prefer people to stay on welfare and struggle to make their lives meaningful? It is very easy to forget the day-to-day benefits of employment when all you have are concerns with political spin. The more Australians we encourage to get into the workforce, the larger our tax base will be. This gives us additional funding to spend in areas of necessity such as health and education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing the government can do to assist a family more than to have those family members eligible to work having a job. The Gillard government is reforming the apprenticeship system to make it more modern and flexible, including accelerating apprenticeships and mentoring support. It is increasing workforce participation by getting disadvantaged Australians the skills they need to get a job—something the opposition had plenty of opportunity to do over the 11½ years those opposite sat on the government benches. We know and industry know, as the Australian community know, that they failed to do anything. They failed to provide the skills this country needed. Those on the opposition benches should hang their heads in shame because we are reaping the disadvantages of those 11½ years of the Howard government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health has been a focus of this budget, something I know we all welcome in this chamber. $2.5 billion has been committed over the next five years to improve and establish an array of community mental health services. This is, once again, another area that those opposite had 11½ years to do something about but failed miserably in. They should be ashamed of themselves. To come in here with the hypocrisy that they have demonstrated thus far is shameful. But the Australian people do see through them. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government has also understood the importance of easy, accessible, quality health care and as a result will invest $1.8 billion to improve regional health infrastructure through the Health and Hospitals Fund regional priorities round. This funding will be directly helping people in my home state of Tasmania, where $240 million has been allocated to the Royal Hobart Hospital. Funding has also been allocated to Cygnet and Sheffield.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Keeping Australians engaged and connected with their communities and fam­ilies is of high importance to this govern­ment. Thousands of older Australians will be able to stay connected to their family and friends through free access to broadband internet, with continued funding under the Gillard government's successful Broadband for Seniors initiative. This government will invest a further $10.4 million over four years to 30 June 2015 to keep supporting the 2,000 Broadband for Seniors kiosks already established across this country.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget that will ensure we are on track for a surplus in 2012-13. This is despite dealing with the new challenges to our finances that come from natural disasters and the lingering effects of the GFC. The budget will also train Australians for better jobs and spread the opportunities of the mining boom. Our government has a track record for getting the big economic calls right. Our policy responses helped protect hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs—</span>

                </a>  Those opposite can laugh, because we know what their solution was with the GFC—and that was to keep your head in the sand, sit back and do nothing. The Australian people have their jobs. We have Australian workers still working because we took the action that was needed. We protected Australian jobs and businesses from the worst global financial downturn in 75 years. Now we are putting the settings right to deal with the pressures and to build our economy. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast with the performance of Tony Abbott and the coalition cannot be more stark. He has a knack of getting the big economic calls wrong: whether it is the GFC, the flood recovery package or health reform. That is what makes them such a risk to the bottom line, to jobs and our economy. For the party that once claimed the high moral ground for fiscal responsibility, they would now struggle to get a seat even at the Mad Hatter's tea party! All the coalition do is oppose. They oppose everything and support nothing. They say this budget is too tough and then they say it is not tough enough. The aim is to cause political division and confusion within the community. But the Australian people are much smarter than that and in fact very much smarter than those opposite. aybe it is about time the coalition thought about the Australian community rather than their own selfish interests. And what I have to say to the chamber and to those listening today it is that I encourage Australians to listen in tomorrow night to what I hope will be an alternative budget put up, because it would be the first time that has happened. We want to know where the savings are coming from, because those opposite cannot have it both ways and they cannot just attack the Public Service in this country. They will not be able to do that because the Australian community sees through them. The Australian community sees how ineffective those opposite are and they are also very much aware of the three Stooges that lead the coalition's financial team.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I must admit I found the whole effort of the Treasurer last night quite bemusing. He is happily admitting that we have a patchwork economy that is growing unevenly across the nation, and then he uses the current Labor mantra for why this would happen. Thank God in some ways, the Labor government must be saying, for the natural disasters that have affected my home state of Queensland and many other parts of Australia because it has allowed them to continue to mask the fact that the only thing that is prospering in this country right now is the mining industry and businesses associated with it. We do indeed have a patchwork economy. And perhaps the government might like to think a little bit about that and about how they might do something about it because this budget certainly is not the way of doing it.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at families and some of the budget measures that have come up. Families include people with mental health problems, they include people with disabilities, they include teenage mothers and their children, they include the vulnerable people who have been affected by floods and cyclones and other natural disasters, they affect fathers who are planning for paid parental leave, they affect people who own small businesses, and yet none of these areas have been helped in any way by the Labor government's budget and by the smoke and mirrors in it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us start with mental health and the much-trumpeted $2.2 billion, shall we? There appears to be about $500 million of new spending in that. The rest of it has already been announced. It follows on very much from the pattern and the policy announced three weeks ago by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and our shadow minister for mental health, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. I might also make the point, perhaps for Senator Polley's edification, that when the current Leader of the Opposition was the minister for health Australia had a record national spend on mental health, the establishment of most of the policies that underpin the work that is going on in that area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at that. Mental health, an extra $500 million or so over four years, and a desperate need. It is a good start, but it is just a bit of a start. Let us look too at the need to get disability support pensioners into work. Great idea, good idea, should be done. However, how are we proposing they get to work? I have received email after email in the past month, since these moves were mooted, saying, 'I'd love to work, but I can't get the care package I need to get someone to come here, give me a shower, get me dressed and give me breakfast in time to turn up to work at the starting time every day.' So we have the much-vaunted national disability insurance scheme, which of course is not even mentioned here because it is not even going to start in this forward estimates period. We already have the criticism of the current scheme saying it is underfunded, inequitable, it is not even a support scheme; it is just something that has been cobbled together. Yes, let us get disability support pensioners out to work, but let us put the supports in place that would give them the chance to take jobs by providing someone to assist them to get ready for work in a timely fashion. Let us put all of those support services out on the never-never, then whose fault will it be when this fails? It is yet another implementation problem that this government has.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to also look at the wonderful $200 million package for early intervention services. Now in the disability area, special education area, I think people are grateful for all of the crumbs they get. People are grateful for this, but $200 million over three years divided by 165,000 students—you come down to about $400 a year per student. This is to provide necessary early inter­ventions and specialist therapies. Has anyone tried to employ a speech pathologist recently? You will pay well over $100 or $150 for an hour's session. So $400 a year per student. It is a start, but it is just a start. It is not something that is going to assist families in any meaningful way. Let us look at the teenage mothers, shall we. I was most amused to hear an apologist for the Labor government on radio recently suggest that, if teenage mothers had problems getting child care locally so they could go to work, as this government wants them to, they could just drive to another childcare centre about 10 minutes away. We are talking about teenage mothers who own cars and who are going to drive to childcare centres? Yes, we are. Again, this government does not have a clue about the reality out there. I do not know many 16- or 17-year-old mothers who drive their own cars.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I said in my newsletter a little while ago that I am expecting a series of poorly thought through plans to take money from middle-income groups so that the government could then ineptly squander it somewhere in the vicinity of people in need. But I did get that wrong because it is not even being squandered ineptly in the area of people in need—it has not even been brought within the vicinity of the people who need it. Once again, we have ideological plans that have no chance of being able to be implemented because the government does not understand their audience and does not understand the practical needs of people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We will have increases in the costs of petrol, electricity, groceries, health costs and mortgage costs brought on by the flood levy, the carbon tax and the mining tax. It will go on and on, yet this government is attempting to say that it is helping families. It is a nonsense.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">What is Labor doing? Labor will get the budget back into the black by 2012-13. We will build Australia's future workforce. One of the biggest crimes against this country committed by the coalition was to diminish the number of tradespeople that were trained in this country. You handed money over to McDonald's and Red Rooster and forgot that you needed tradespeople in this country to build the country. Your record on building skills for this country was abysmal. It was an absolute national disgrace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We will build the infrastructure in this country. You were warned time and time again by the Reserve Bank, by the Treasury, by engineers and by academics. Academics said the infrastructure in this country needed to be rebuilt, and what did you in the coalition do? You did nothing because you had no vision and no values to take this country forward with. We will continue, through this budget, to invest $36 billion in roads, rails and ports, including $1 billion in funding for the duplication of the Pacific Highway. We are going to put better hospitals and health care in place. When we came to government, what was the complaint we heard? That the hospitals were in crisis. The coalition could not deliver on hospitals. They could not deliver on health care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we would make every school a great school, and we will make schools great schools. I have opened a number of BER projects and, let me tell you, the number of coalition members who want to come along and actually bathe in the glory of increasing the infrastructure in our schools is quite mind-boggling. Your members are there in droves, trying to get their picture taken with the opening of the new facility that the federal government has put in place.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to help families, we are going to help low-income earners and we are going to invest in our regions. The Nationals, who are supposed to be about regional Australia, delivered nothing but pork-barrelling over all the years they were in power—anything to try and get a vote but nothing of any vision or future proofing of the economy. We will invest $4.3 billion in this budget on our regions and on our businesses. To argue that this is an assault on families and the hypocrisy of the coalition to talk about cost-of-living pressures is mind-boggling.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government which has delivered 750,000 jobs since it has been in power. We will deliver another 500,000 jobs over the next two years. We are prepared to take on the fear campaigns and the nonsense that will leave our economy in the backwoods for generations to come. We will put a price on carbon and we will make sure that our industries are at the cutting edge. We will build for the low-carbon future—something which you know has to be done but which, for pure base political motives, you are not prepared to pull on. We are prepared to make sure that the miners pay their fair share of taxes, that ordinary people in this country get a fair go and that the money does not just slosh around in the back pockets of the mining magnates. We will look after pensioners. We will look after school­children. That is what Labor is about—building jobs and building a good society. Let me tell you about Menzies—the great Sir Robert Menzies that you keep talking about. He said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Nothing could be worse for democracy than to adopt the practice of permitting knowledge to be overthrown by ignorance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The knowledge in this nation is being overthrown every day by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and his three-line points of view. Tony Abbott is certainly about delivering ignorance, not knowledge, in this country—the antithesis of what Sir Robert Menzies said. Sir Robert Menzies also said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Fear can never be a proper or useful ingredient in those mutual relations of respect and good-will which ought to exist between the elector and the elected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day in this place, we see a disrespect for the Australian people from the coalition; we see fear and ignorance from the opposition party benches. We see fear being peddled on everything that this government is trying to do. The Leader of the Opposition takes unprincipled positions and shamelessly peddles fear and ignorance. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition are the great pretenders. That is what they are: great pretenders. Tony Abbott is out there masquerading as the friend of workers. Well, workers are onto Tony Abbott. They know he is not a friend of workers; they know he is a friend of Work Choices. They are the great pretenders. The opposition try to tell us they are good economic managers, but what did they say at the time of the global financial crisis? They said, 'Wait and see what happens.' That was the opposition's approach. That has been proved wrong, while it has been proved that what this government did saved and underpinned 210,000 jobs and kept this country out of recession. They are the great pretenders on climate change. Those in the opposition who do believe in climate change pretend that they now do not believe, because the Leader of the Opposition considers it 'crap'. There are those on the other side like Senator Boswell, who just does not believe in it, who keeps telling us that he goes out on his yacht off Brisbane on a regular basis and cannot see any rise in the sea level. That is the level of argument dominating the coalition. The great pretenders try to pretend that there were no disasters in Japan, that the GFC had no influence on the Australian economy, that there were no disasters in Australia—no floods, no Cyclone Yasi—and no disasters in New Zealand. None of those things matter; they really do not matter! They want to continue to run fear campaigns on refugees, on government debt and on climate change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There is little left of the Menzian legacy in this rabble sitting across from me every sitting period. They are not Menzians; they are extremists—and they are extremists on all the issues that are important for this country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk about us being tough on Australian families—what hypocrisy! Let me go back to what Senator Bushby said a bit earlier in this place. He said, 'We created 380,000 jobs through Work Choices.' Senator Bushby, who is in the chamber, nods his head, because he is a great supporter of Work Choices. Senator Bushby and Senator Abetz want to go back to Work Choices. They want to go back to a position where 65 per cent of workers on individual agreements lose their penalty rates, where 70 per cent of workers lose their shift allowances, where over a million award workers lose $100 a week, where 68 per cent of workers lose their annual leave loading, where 25 per cent of workers lose their public holidays and where 3½ million workers lose their protection from unfair dismissal. Don't lecture us about economic ability; you are a failure. And Peter Costello was one of the worst treasurers this country has ever seen. The record is there. He was incompetent, he had no courage and he did nothing to build this nation—a failed Treasurer, and now a failed opposition.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act requires the Committee to consider 'draft estimates for the Audit Office', with the Committee ultimately making a statement to the Senate following the budget on whether, in our opinion, the Auditor-General has been given sufficient funding to carry out his duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In support of this process, the Auditor-General is empowered under the Act to disclose their budget proposals to the Committee, which we then consider in making representations to Government as necessary. This process reflects both the Committee's status as the Parliament's audit committee, and the Auditor-General's status as an independent officer of the Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee met with the Auditor-General in March to review the Audit Office's budget proposals for the coming financial year. The Auditor-General advised that, although facing a number of cost pressures, he is conscious of the overall pressures on the Government's budget and is not seeking additional budget supplementation at this time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Auditor-General advised that, in common with other agencies, the ANAO is facing increased employee and supplier costs. He again reiterated that the Audit Office has had to absorb the impact of recent changes to the Australian Auditing Standards which came into effect from 1 January 2010. Despite the support of the previous Committee, the ANAO were not successful in receiving additional supplementation in either the 2009-10 or 2010-11 Budgets to offset these costs. The Auditor-General advised the Committee that the ANAO is now managing significant additional costs in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Auditor-General advised that further pressure could result from the possible implementation of the JCPAA's recommendation in Report 419: Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997. The recommendations would require the Auditor-General to review the adequacy of agencies' performance indicators. This is not expected to affect the ANAO's 2011-12 Budget as the report still requires formal Government consideration. However, if implemented, in addition to initial set up costs, ongoing costs of between seven and ten percent of the cost of the financial statement audit program could be required. The Committee would expect the Auditor-General to seek additional budget supplementation to cover this extended mandate in 2012-13.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee appreciates the efforts of the Auditor-General and his staff to establish a strong working relationship with the new Committee. They have made themselves available to brief the Committee regularly and have been responsive to our requests for information on a variety of topics. The Committee looks forward to continuing a productive relationship with the Audit Office over the term of this Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recognises the important role the Auditor-General plays in scrutinising the Government and will continue to support that role. The Committee does not want to see the discretionary work of the Audit Office suffer due to future budget constraints and will endeavour to ensure the Office remains adequately resourced. This acknowledges the importance of the performance audit program and the contribution that the ANAO makes to better practice across-agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Audit Office's total revenue from Government is $74.891 million in 2011-12. Mr President, the Auditor-General has advised that his appropriation for the year ahead is sufficient for him to discharge his statutory obligations and planned audit work plan for 2011-12. He also advises that his office will be able to absorb the increase in the efficiency dividend over the next two years. Therefore, we endorse the budget proposed for the Audit Office for 2011-12.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 116 contains the Committee's views on 15 treaties ranging from amendments to CITES, and the Australia and New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement; to ILO conventions on the working conditions of sailors, the treatment of asbestos, and occupational health and safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am happy to advise, Mr President, that this Report deals with the last of the treaties for which consideration was delayed by the 2010 Federal Election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a credit to the Committee's Members that it has been able to consider and report on no less than 55 treaties since the election, and has met the agreed reporting deadline for each one of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition Mr President, for many of the treaties, the Committee did not only issue invitations to participate to its regular stakeholders, including Commonwealth Government Agencies and State and Territory Governments, but was able to take evidence from a range of other interested parties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example Mr President, the Committee's consideration of amendments to the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement involved a visit to suiting manufacturers the Stafford Group, whose plant is in North Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Stafford Group retails its suits under the brands Anthony Squires, Giotto and 1096. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Anthony Squires is the only retailer of high quality suits still manufacturing in Australia. The Stafford Group is concerned that this arrangement will be placed at risk by the amendments proposed to the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee has been assured by the Government that it is aware of The Stafford Group's tenuous position, and is working to ameliorate the impact of the treaty amendments on that organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, I would also like to draw the Parliament's attention to the participation of the seafaring community in the inquiry into the ILO Maritime Convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Convention is intended to provide a set of basic working conditions for seafarers employed in international commercial shipping. The Convention requires that seafarers, amongst other things: be properly trained; have written, legally enforceable pay and conditions; and have appropriate living conditions and access to medical care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Crucially, the Convention will ensure that the conditions extend to ships registered in countries that are not party to the Convention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">International shipping that does not meet these conditions will face severe penalties when it enters the ports of Convention signatories. The penalties will remove any shipping cost advantages attributable to poor working and living conditions for seafarers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Amongst those to have already ratified the Convention are the 'flag of convenience' states Liberia, Panama and the Bahamas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Convention has been well received by the seafaring community in Australia. Amongst those expressing support for Australia's ratification of the Convention are: peak employer organisations Shipping Australia Ltd and the Australian Ship Owners' Association; seafarers' representatives the Maritime Union of Australia and the Aust­ralian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers; and representatives of charities supporting seafarers the Australian Council of the Mission to Seafarers and the Sydney Seafarers' Centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All of these organisations had useful suggestions about how the Convention is imple­mented, and the Committee commends their suggestions to the Government for consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, only one submission, from the Australian Patriotic Movement, opposed the Convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, Mr President, Report 116 expresses the Committee's frustration about treaties amen­ded without ratification that come into force before they are scrutinised by the Committee or the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the Treaty amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships was tabled in Parliament in November 2010, after having come into force some five months earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This does not need to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Changes to treaties amended without ratifi­cation are provided to signatory countries for consideration up to twelve months before they take effect. This period allows signatory countries that do not agree with the changes to either 'opt out' of the changes or attempt to have the changes removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the case of the Treaty amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, the amendments were provided to Australia in mid 2009, and the period for objecting to the Treaty ended in June 2010. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, there is enough time in this twelve month period for Parliament and the public to make a material contribution to the outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Report recommends that amendments to treaties of this sort be referred to the Parliament for consideration at the time they are first provided to Australia, so that the Parliament can have a say before the changes come into force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key aim of the delegation was to visit two countries that are relatively new democracies. In particular, the delegation aimed to gain an understanding of political, economic and social issues in both countries and to obtain an insight into Australia's development assistance activities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bhutan is a small landlocked country in the eastern Himalayas in South Asia, bordered by India to the south, east and west and by China to the north. Bhutan has recently developed from an absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. Australia enjoys a modest yet warm relationship with Bhutan, extending back to the early 1960s, with formal diplomatic relations with Bhutan being established in 2002. The initial relationship was based around the provision of aid to Bhutan. The focus of Australia's aid program is now primarily on human resources development. The Australian government will provide approximately $5.3 million in development assistance to Bhutan in 2010-11. Education, through a scholarships program, is the focus of Australia's bilateral assistance to Bhutan. Since 1998, nearly 600 Bhutanese students have studied in Australia through various scholarship schemes. As a result of these scholarship programs there is now a core of Bhutanese senior to mid-level public servants who have been educated in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first members of the parliament of Bhutan took their seats in 2008. His Majesty the King of Bhutan has stated that the country's first democratic government has the responsibility of setting the right examples, laying strong foundations and promoting the best practices of democracy. The parliament of Australia is able to assist the parliament of Bhutan in dealing with the steep learning curve it faces in all aspects of operating a parliament. The parliament of Bhutan is seeking guidance and advice, particularly in the areas of legislative drafting, development of procedures for both houses and the development of secretariat support for members of parliament, both houses and parliamentary committees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report recommends that the Australian government provide legislative drafting assistance to the parliament of Bhutan. The delegation understands that providing training in drafting is a very resource intensive activity for our agencies; however, that drafting expertise is of vital importance, especially to parliaments that are newly established and still coming to terms with new procedures, practices, roles and responsibilities. The report recognises the value of the Australian parliament's inter­parlia­mentary study program; however, the report recommends that the Australian parliament investigate the provision of more exclusive access to our parliament for senior parliamentary officials from Bhutan. Short-term residencies for several officials, perhaps over a sitting fortnight, may provide unique opportunities for those officials to learn, through shadowing roles, about our parliamentary departmental functions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mongolia is a landlocked country in East and Central Asia. Mongolia became a democracy in 1990 after 70 years of Soviet style, single party rule. Australia established diplomatic relations with Mongolia in 1972, with bilateral relations developing further following democratic and free market reforms in Mongolia in the early 1990s. Australia has been a longstanding development partner for Mongolia. Since 1995 Australia has provided more than $50 million in aid to Mongolia. In 2010-11 Australia will provide approximately $7.4 million in aid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1993 the provision of scholarships to Mongolia has been Australia's primary mode of development assistance. In recent years the number of scholarships has almost doubled. The Mongolia Australian Scholar­ships Program provides 28 Australian Development Scholarships to Mongolians from both the public and private sectors each year. The scholarships program is highly regarded by the Mongolian government, with graduates including current and former ministers, parliamentarians and senior public service officials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation met with representatives from Australian businesses with a presence in Mongolia. Companies such as Leighton and Rio Tinto now have significant invest­ment in Mongolian mining and resources, particularly through coalmines at Tavan Tolgoi and the substantial copper and gold mine at Oyu Tolgoi in the Gobi Desert. Australian businesses have benefited from the presence of an Austrade official on a trial basis in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar. Australian businesses empha­sised the importance of Australian govern­ment representation in Mongolia and called for, at best, representation through an embassy in Ulaanbaatar and, at a minimum, permanent Austrade representation. The delegation notes that Mongolia established an embassy in Canberra in 2008.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation observed that the most pressing need for larger firms is the presence of high-level advocacy to the Mongolian government. This is particularly important for the protection of current investments and for the support of new ventures. The delegation considers that Australian government representation through an embassy in Ulaanbaatar is necessary for the continued development of a strong relationship between the two countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation was very warmly received. I would like to thank the host nations for their friendly hospitality and willingness to share their experiences with us. I would like to thank the many individuals and organi­sations in the host countries who were generous with their hospitality, insight and knowledge. I would also like to thank the other members of the delegation: the Hon. David Hawker MP, the Hon. Bob Debus MP and Mrs Kay Hull MP, all of whom retired at the end of the 42nd Parliament after many years of dedicated parliamentary service. I also particularly want to thank Mr Anthony Overs, secretary to the delegation, for his assistance. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a member of the delegation that went to Mongolia for the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum. The delegation comprised the Speaker of the House of Representatives; the member for Reid, Mr John Murphy; and me. The delegation would also have included two members from the coalition, but unfortunately the flooding in Queensland and Victoria prevented their participation on this occasion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A delegation from the Australian parliament has participated in every annual meeting as well as the meetings that prepared for the establishment of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, and this was the second time that I had attended an annual meeting of the APPF. My first experience was in Jakarta in 2006, and I was very pleased to have the opportunity to renew friendships at the APPF and to see the way the forum is developing as it approaches its 20th anniversary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As usual, there were three broad subject headings on the meeting agenda for the APPF: economic and trade matters, political and security issues, and interparliamentary cooperation. The Australian delegation to the forum usually proposes a number of draft resolutions that are then debated and negotiated during the meeting. On this occasion the draft agenda for the meeting was delayed, and so we were able to propose only one resolution—and that was on the reform of the APPF. The New Zealand and Canadian delegations joined with us in finalising a resolution for adoption by the plenary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although our delegation was smaller in number than usual and proposed only this resolution, we were very active in the plenary and participated in all sessions of the drafting committee and in bilateral meetings with other delegations, some of which I will refer to shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each member of the delegation spoke in the plenary. The Speaker, Mr Jenkins, contributed to debate on reform of the APPF and on peace and security in the region. The member for Reid spoke on the agenda item on promotion of economic partnership and free trade. And in the plenary I addressed an agenda item that I had also spoken about in Jakarta in 2006, the Millennium Develop­ment Goals. It was useful to make a comparison of the situation then with the current context. The resolution that the meeting adopted on this topic included an affirmation of the role of parliaments in legislating, budgeting and monitoring, to support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as participating in the formal parts of the meeting, the delegation had a number of meetings with individual Mongolian leaders and delegations from other countries. The delegation was pleased to have meetings with the Prime Minister of Mongolia, who subsequently visited this parliament shortly afterwards; with the Chairman of the State Great Hural, who was also President of APPF 19; and the delegations from Russia, South Korea and China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our hosts at the parliament in Mongolia, the State Great Hural, were very generous and thoughtful to us, and I would like to thank them for that. The Vice-Chairman of the Hural,<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>Mr Enkhbold Nyamaa, had studied at the University of Sydney and, from our first day in Ulaanbaatar, he made us especially welcome. He also ensured that we met a number of Mozzies—members of the Mongolia Australia Society. Mr Enkhbold, like all of the Mongolian people we met, was friendly and had the same dry sense of humour that we think of as the hallmark of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparation for the meeting of the APPF, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra assisted us, as usual, with comprehensive briefing materials, and we appreciated their assistance. The delegation also greatly appreciated the invaluable and tireless assistance of Ms Catherine Cornish, the delegation's secretary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian embassy in Seoul is currently responsible for relations in Mongolia and the First Secretary, Mr Charles Adamson, travelled to Ulaanbaatar and assisted the delegation throughout the meeting. He gave us practical and thoughtful advice as we prepared for meetings, and he continued that role until we left. We were very grateful to have him with us for the whole time and for his understanding of Australia's interests in Mongolia as well as on matters that arose during the APPF and the various bilateral meetings. So our thanks to Mr Adamson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wish to thank the staff member from the Hural, the Mongolian parliament, who was our liaison officer: Mr Amartuvshin Amgalanbayar. Amartuvshin had studied at Monash University, so he was well versed in Australian ways, and he was always cheerful, calm and thoroughly professional and a delight to spend time with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my abiding memories of Ulaanbaatar is the weather. It is the coldest national capital in the world, and the January meeting was in midwinter. The temperatures averaged minus 34 degrees. It will be some time before I complain about a Canberra winter again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next meeting of the APPF is scheduled to be held in Tokyo in January 2012, and I wish our colleagues in the Japanese Diet well in their preparations, particularly given the devastating tsunami and earthquakes that have occurred in Japan since the APPF meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, I would like to thank the Speaker for his leadership of the delegation, and the member for Reid for his enthusiastic cooperation in the delegation's work. I believe that the delegation effectively represented the Parliament of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Those acts removed a longstanding barrier for appropriately qualified and experienced midwives who wish to provide high-quality midwifery services to Australian women as part of a collaborative team with doctors and other health professionals.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Act 2010 currently excludes ‘employed’ midwives from accessing a Commonwealth Contribution and a Run-off  Cover Commonwealth Contribution, to ensure there is no intentional cost shifting from employers of midwives to the Commonwealth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill tidies up the act by placing the rule-making powers in a more appropriate section and thus ensures that eligible ‘self-employed’ midwives are not excluded from access to a Common­wealth contribution for claims that are made while they are in the workforce and also any claims that are made after they retire. By doing this the act will continue to exclude other ‘employed’ midwives (such as those employed by private hospitals) to prevent cost shifting to the Commonwealth by employers.  </span>

This will ensure that the bill will be able to accurately describe midwives and their employment arrangements that are within the scope of the government's maternity reform policy. </span>

Our Sex Discrimination Act, now more than a quarter of a century old, realised our obligations as a ratifying party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. It encompasses, too, parts of the ILO Convention 156 which refers specifically to those workers who have family respon­sibilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the act's overriding intention is to promote equality between men and women. It eliminates discrimination on the basis of gender, marital status, pregnancy, and family responsibilities in the context of unlawful dismissal. It aims to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace, in education, and in the provision of accommodation, goods and services. The Sex Discrimination Act has proved its worth over more than 25 years of profound social and economic change in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Age Discrimination Act 2004 is an equally worthy adjunct. Its aim is to ensure that a person's age does not result in less favourable treatment in the areas of employment, education, or the provision of goods, services or Commonwealth programs. The act also protects those whose age might otherwise disadvantage them. Individually and together, these acts have assisted and protected Australians—both women and men—in all walks of life and enabled them to participate fully in our social, public and economic environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to the bill before us. It will augment the provisions of the existing Sex Discrimination Act 1984 by strengthening protections against sex discrimination and sexual harassment, and it will establish the position of an Age Discrimination Com­missioner in the Australian Human Rights Commission to make certain the proposition that all citizens, whatever their age, are able to participate in Australian society. The amendments intended to improve protection against sex discrimin­ation and sexual harassment are just one element of the government's response to the inquiry of our Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee into the effectiveness of the Sex Dis­crimination Act in eliminating discrimination and promoting gender equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents four strategic amendments to the present sex discrimin­ation legislation. No. 1, it will make certain that the act provides equal protection to both women and men. No. 2, it will enlarge the ambit of the prohibition on discrimination with regard to family responsibilities. This would ensure equivalent protection from discrimination to both men and women in every sphere of endeavour. This prohibition will of course encompass indirect discrimination as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, our Labor government will never treat Australian workers and working families with disdain, as units in an economic equation that takes no account of personal circumstances or personal need. We are committed to supporting our people, to enhancing productivity, to allowing workplace flexibility, and to underpinning our com­petitive edge. For these reasons, the third amendment will establish discrimination with regard to breastfeeding as a distinct and separate ground of discrimination rather than as an element of sex discrimination. And No. 4 will strengthen the protections against sexual harassment in schools and workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Court cases featured in the news over the last 12 months or so have highlighted the fact that sexual harassment continues to be a significant problem in the workplace.  profile of our Sex Discrimination Commissioner in a recent edition of Fairfax's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Magazine</span> indicated her ongoing concern with this matter and re-emphasised the need 'to focus on the alleged behaviour and whether such a thing could happen where we work', rather than on the appearance of the complainant or the quantum of the com­pensation sought. It is incumbent upon us as legislators to ensure that the message is loud and clear: sexual harassment—against women or men—will not be tolerated. I fully support these amendments, and turn now with equal enthusiasm to those related to the Age Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will establish and administratively support the position of Age Discrimination Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. This is a timely initiative, and one which will simultaneously provide a specific advocate for the rights of mature Australians in the workforce and elsewhere and enable our Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who has thus far been responsible for both areas, to focus specifically on sex discrimination matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is undoubtedly the case that we have an ageing demographic. Our forward planning has highlighted the requirement for a dedicated role in age discrimination matters: to engage with employers, employees and communities; to address workplace and community age discrimination; to educate people about the values of fairness and respect; and to alleviate the attitudes and the stereotypes that often, regrettably, hurt our older people and dissuade or prevent their full engagement. Our mature citizens, our mature workers, our mature carers and volunteers all represent invaluable skills and resources and provide invaluable services. They are our social memory and, increasingly, often our corporate memory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we discuss today provides, through its amendments to the act, the mechanism for the appointment of the new Age Discrimination Commissioner, whose term is scheduled to begin from July this year, and the terms and conditions of his or her employment. By virtue too of the amendments, the commissioner will be a member of the commission and have the same advocacy powers as his or her fellow commissioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will: impact positively on and strengthen protections for working families by expanding the prohibition of discrimination for both men and women on the ground of family responsibilities; send a strong message that sexual harassment is unacceptable anywhere, including in the workplace; and confront the incidence of age discrimination in the workplace and in the broader community. They will contribute also to the ongoing cultural change that consequently improves understanding and cooperation and enhances the dignity of and respect for all of our people, whatever their stage of life. I commend the Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill 2010.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The bill will make important amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act to better protect both women and men from discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, in schools and in the community at large. In particular, the bill will ensure the act provides equal protection to women and men. It will also broaden the prohibition on discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities to provide equal protection from discrimination, including indirect discrimination, to both men and women in all areas of work. It will also establish breastfeeding as a separate ground of discrimination rather than as a subset of sex discrimination. Finally, it will strengthen the protections against sexual harassment in workplaces and schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act contained in this bill implements in part the government's response to the 2008 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act—and what a fine and upstanding report that is indeed, Acting Deputy President Crossin. Other recommendations will be considered as part of the government's broader review of Commonwealth antidiscrimination laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes historic amendments to the Age Discrimination Act to establish the position of Age Discrimina­tion Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. There is a need for a dedicated commissioner to engage with stakeholders including industry and community representatives, to address discrimination in the workplace and in the community, to promote respect and fairness and to tackle the attitudes and stereotypes that can and do contribute to age discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed additional funding of $5.7 million to the Australian Human Rights Commission for the appointment of a new Age Discrimination Commissioner and a stand-alone Race Discrimination Commissioner, which will mean that once again we will have stand-alone race, sex, age and disability dis­crimination commissioners. This will ensure that the Australian Human Rights Com­mission continues to play a leading role in the protection and promotion of human rights, including their valuable public education role and advocacy for vulnerable members of our community. Appointment processes are currently underway and the new commissioners are expected to commence their duties on 1 July 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its report on this bill. In its report the committee recommended that the explanatory memorandum be revised to specifically recognise the role of the Age Discrimination Commissioner in protecting and promoting the rights of younger Australians. I would like to take this opportunity to address the committee's recommendation and in particular confirm that the new Age Discrimination Com­missioner will be an advocate for all Australians who are susceptible to age discrimination, regardless of their age. This could include children, teenagers, retirees, mature Australians and everyone in between. A specific area which the new commissioner will focus on is the need to address issues in employment against older workers, which continues to be the most common cause for complaint under the Age Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also recommended that the government consider the outstanding recommendations in the committee's 2008 report on the effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act as part of the review of antidiscrimination laws under Australia's human rights framework. I would like to reiterate that the government will and, indeed, is doing something. The review and consolidation of federal antidiscrimination legislation into a single act is underway and the government will be undertaking public consultations in 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also considered the inclusion in the bill of an exemption from marital status discrimination for state and territory laws relating to the legal process for changing a person's sex on the births, deaths and marriages register. The exemption has been included to maintain the existing policy position that the registration of change of sex is a matter for states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just make a few remarks concerning the proposed opposition amendments. Senator Brandis has foreshadowed that he will be moving opposition amendments to the bill during the committee stage. I will address each of the proposed amendments in more detail during that stage, but let me now say that the government will be opposing each of these amendments. I would also like to note at this stage that the government does not agree with the opposition's character­isation of the amendments contained in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill will implement important reforms in the areas of age and sex discrimination. These reforms are but one part of the government's strong and continuing commitment to fostering an inclusive Australia and ensuring our antidiscrimination laws are relevant to both now and into the future. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a>  The reason these amendments are being dealt with together but not with amendments (4) and (6) is that these are the bracket of amendments which deal with the extension of the grounds of discrimination to indirect discrimination on the basis of family responsibilities, whereas the other two opposition amendments deal with different topics. These amendments reflect the opposition's opposition to the extension of the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of family responsibility. (1) is directed against the introduction of proposed section 7A2, while amendments (2), (3) and (5) are consequential to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated in the second reading debate, the coalition supports a prohibition against discrimination on the grounds of family responsibility. That is our position; it has always been our position. But we are concerned at the extension of the characterisation of discrimination, which would fall foul of that prohibition to include the very amorphous concept of indirect discrimination. As the bill puts it, imposing 'a condition, requirement or practice that has, or is likely to have, the effect of dis­advantaging persons with family respon­sibilities' carries a substantial risk of unintended consequences. The proposed extension would make employers liable in respect of working conditions or practices where there was no intention to discriminate and, indeed, where there was every intention not to discriminate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my second reading debate speech I gave the example of a company needing to reduce the hours of its casual workforce. That would have a disproportionate effect on workers with family responsibilities, because they seem to have more pressing financial commitments than those without family responsibilities. The scope of claims that could be arguably in breach of the proposed extended language of the statute is enormous because of the time, money and added worry that having a family necessarily entails.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the objection that a reasonableness test applies, the answer is that the act places the onus of establishing reasonableness on the employer, whose compliance obligations would therefore extend to anticipating every effect of every work practice on those employees whose lives tend to be more complicated than their unencumbered colleagues, and the employer must respond in a way that does not preference men over women or vice versa or parents over workers without children. What the provision does, in effect, is to legislate for employers to implement a work-life balance scheme in anticipation of possible liability for discrimination. The proper way to address those issues is through the industrial relations system, where the interests of employers and employees can be managed consultatively and by reference to appropriate processes. This provision, however, is a blunt instrument which creates potentially boundless claims, and responsibility is sheeted home entirely to the employer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally and lastly, let me make this point: when this parliament imposes new burdens, obligations or responsibilities upon people, it is good legislative practice to make those burdens, obligations and responsibilities as clear as they can possibly be so that the people upon whom that imposition is made know what is required of them and can arrange their affairs and, in the case of a business or a workplace, arrange their practices to ensure that they are compliant with those obligations. hen you introduce an amorphous concept like indirectness, that as a matter of the very meaning of language adds an additional penumbra of uncertainty around the core concept. So it is that much more difficult for people to know whether or not their conduct is compliant. As we know, when we introduce a greater degree of uncertainty into a law, then it involves additional cost consequences with full compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, as legislators, need to be specific in telling people what we expect of them when we impose an obligation upon them. And to expand the scope of that obligation into the amorphous, almost category-less, concept of indirect breach of the legislation flies in the face of that very legislative objective. It flies in the face of good legislative practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the reason the Liberal senators gave in the committee, and for the reasons of good legislative practice that I have recited, the opposition opposes this amendment. We look to the crossbenchers, particularly to Senator Xenophon—whose role as a champion of the interests of small business and small employers we all acknowledge and respect—to think very carefully about the potentially very serious consequences for small business were this amendment not to be carried.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FEENEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I seek to make a few remarks concerning the contribution made by Senator Brandis about the opposition amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key feature of this bill is to enhance protections from family responsibilities discrimination. The Gillard government is committed to help Australian working families, and the proposed amendments in the bill will assist both men and women to balance work and family responsibilities without fear of penalty. The proposed amendments implement a recommendation of the Senate committee's 2008 inquiry into the Sex Discrimination Act, which was based on evidence from various groups, including business representatives and human rights advocates, which supported the need to improve the current provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will provide greater consistency with existing protections and therefore help to simplify the current regulatory approach. The government, as I indicated earlier, will not support the opposition's amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are disappointed that the opposition is seeking to limit these new protections to direct discrimination only so that working parents will not be protected from indirect discrimination on the basis of their family responsibilities. We do not accept the opposition's claims that these provisions are unnecessary or will unnecessarily impose additional burdens on employers. The protections do not discriminate on the grounds of family responsibilities and only applies to reasonable working arrangements. An employer must have legitimate reasons for their actions so as to avoid unlawfully discriminating on the grounds of family responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, the new provisions would only apply to reasonable working arrangements. As an example, it would not be reasonable for an employee in a restaurant to be unavailable at meal times due to family responsibilities, as being available during these periods is evidently an inherent requirement of the position. In contrast, it may constitute discrimination if an employer decided to deny a worker the opportunity to undertake specialised training solely because that worker had previously taken time off to care for their sick child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has suggested that these provisions require an employer to take into account an employee's disposable income or cost of living before making a legitimate business decision. This is quite simply not the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now seek to make a few remarks about how the new family responsibilities provision interacts with the Fair Work Act and National Employment Standards. The National Employment Standards, found in the Fair Work Act, provide the right to request flexible working arrangements. Such a request can only be refused on reasonable business grounds. The Fair Work Act also prohibits an employer from taking adverse action against an employee, which can include a range of employment decisions, on the basis of family responsibilities. These amendments will ensure that the SDA is consistent with these provisions by: firstly, affording the protections to men and women equally; secondly, applying to all areas of employment, not just termination decisions; and, finally, including indirect discrimina­tion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prohibiting discrimination on the basis of family responsibilities in the SDA will bolster the protections afforded by these provisions. It will reassure employees that they can balance their work and family responsibilities without fear of dismissal or discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what impact the family responsibilities will have on business, we say that discrimination against men and women on the grounds of family or carer res­ponsibilities is currently prohibited under the Fair Work Act 2009 and, of course, also under relevant state and territory legislation. The amendments will clarify the obligations of employers, making them consistent at the federal level. We argue that the bill does not impose an additional regulatory burden on business. Instead, they will operate to reduce the existing regulatory burden arising from inconsistencies in legislation found at the federal, state and territory levels, a fact recognised by the Senate committee in its report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the government's project to review and consolidate federal antidiscrimination laws into a single act will focus on removing unnecessary regulatory overlap and making the system more user friendly. Put simply, the proposed provisions do not require employers to take into account the living expenses of people with family responsibilities. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  Parliamentary Secretary Feeney, the conduct you have described would be caught by a prohibition against direct discrimination; and, as I have been at pains to say, the opposition supports the prohibition of discrimination against people on the grounds of family responsibilities—as long as that is direct or intended. But the problem with your argument is that that is not what the proposed section 7A does. If I may take you to clause 2 of the proposed new section, this is how it defines discrimination:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the purposes of this Act, a person (the <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">discriminator </span>) discriminates against another person (the <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">aggrieved person</span> ) on the ground of the aggrieved person’s family responsibilities if the discriminator imposes, or proposes to impose, a condition, requirement or practice that has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging persons with family responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what it says.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us take a relatively small business. You may have the business owner or the business operator with a perfect record when it comes to treating people of both genders equally and with equal respect. He or she may be a business operator who goes out of their way to be careful of and considerate of the needs of his or her employees who have family responsibilities. This person might be a paragon of antidiscrimination practice. But in the business they might employ single people without family responsibilities and married people or people with children who do have family responsibilities. Because there is not an element of intention in your proposed provision—because it does not include what lawyers call a 'purpose test' but only an 'effects test'—this business operator, if he or she introduces a practice that has a differential effect on the single person or the person with family responsibilities or if it is even a practice which may not have any differential effect but is likely to have a differential effect, falls foul of the prohibition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think you have children, Parliamentary Secretary. I have children. Most of our colleagues do. Anyone who has any familiarity with family circumstances knows that the parents of children have particular obligations as a result of that fact alone that single people do not have; and therefore, a change in workplace arrangements is bound to affect employees with parental res­ponsibilities in a different way from the way it affects employees without parental responsibilities. Because of the legislative overreach in the proposed section 7A, the business operator whom I have postulated—this paragon of good antidiscrimination practice whose motives are as pure as can be and who would never intentionally discriminate against one of his or her employees because of family circum­stances—could still fall foul of it simply because of the fact of life that people with children live different lives and have different pressures and, therefore, have different workplace pressures from single people. That, if I may say so respectfully, Parliamentary Secretary, is unreasonable, and it does impose an unreasonable compliance burden on, in particular, all small business operators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, as well, as I said in the second reading debate, the opposition is also concerned that a provision like this could be used for a collateral purpose: to achieve an industrial relations outcome in prosecution of an industrial relations agenda, not for the bona fide purpose of preventing discriminatory practices in the workplace itself. We all know how legislative pro­hibitions, burdens or superadded obligations can be used for collateral purposes, and that also ought always to be avoided. Unless, Parliamentary Secretary, you can be reassured that no decision an employer ever makes will have a different effect on employees who have children and on employees who do not have the family responsibility of children, then such an employer will always potentially be in breach of this law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can it possibly be the case that it is good legislation to create a prohibition so wide that any employer could always be in breach of it merely because that employer employs parents and non-parents among the workforce? What it will have—and beware the law of unintended consequences—is a greater reluctance, particularly for small business operators, to employ people with family responsibilities in the first place but to mask their recruitment practices in such a way that it would never be apparent that that was their motive. The result of section 7A will be to entrench much deeper potential discrimination against people with family responsibilities because of the incompetence of the legislative overreach inherent in this section.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-State">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I would like to ensure that it is on the record that the Greens will not be supporting any of the coalition's amendments. I realise that they are being moved in two blocks—or at least that is my understanding, Senator Brandis. There is no way that the Greens will be supporting these amendments. The justification being put forward by Senator Brandis on behalf of the coalition is simply an attempt to find any which way to get out of the fact that for far too long Australian working women in particular have wanted this parliament to accept that there is discrimination in our workplaces—whether it is based on gender, whether it is based on our family responsibilities or whether it is based on the age of a woman, particularly if she is in a family situation. It does happen, and that is why there was an inquiry into this issue. For far too long Australian women have been asking for this parliament to take this issue seriously, and to come in here and hear the opposition try to justify the idea that somewhere there should be a loophole for employers to continue to discriminate is absolutely appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue is the coalition's attempt to ensure that the Human Rights Commission does not get the support it needs to make sure that these new laws are monitored and looked after. We know what the coalition's view on the Human Rights Commission is: you hate it. You do absolutely everything you can to tear the commission down, whether through this bill or any other bill. You spend your entire time during Senate estimates ripping into the Human Rights Commission just because you feel like it and not because of anything it does wrong.</span>

This is a piece of legislation that Australian working women in particular have been calling for for a very, very long time, and it is about time that we just got on with it, got it passed and got over this pettiness being put forward by the coalition.</span>

                    </a>  I am just a generous soul, I suppose, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. First of all, let me for the record say that the Australian Human Rights Commission is and has always been supported by the coalition. But that does not mean that either we—or for that matter you, Senator Hanson-Young, as a parliamentarian with oversight of a Commonwealth agency—should not feel at liberty to criticise it at times, including in estimates. It is a rather shocking proposition that merely because a senator criticises an aspect of the operation of a Commonwealth agency in Senate estimates they hate that agency. That is a very, very foolish thing to say, Senator Hanson-Young, and not worthy of you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">May I return to the principal point here: it is very foolish indeed to describe the coalition's opposition to proposed section 7A of the bill as a 'loophole'. This is a proposition that says: 'We will overreach as far as we like in order to prohibit a practice, and because somebody points out to us that we have overreached they are therefore seeking to rely on a loophole. Their heart isn't in it. They don't really support the legislative intention.' Senator Hanson-Young, in case you were not listening, the coalition supports this bill.</span>

That is what the Senate does, Senator Hanson-Young—it moves amendments to improve legislation where in the opinion of non-government senators that legislation could be improved in the committee stage. The fact is that we support this bill, but there are three particular aspects of it which form the subject of our amendments and which we think are injudicious and bad legislative practice and will in fact have the unintended consequence of making discrimination worse, not better. For that and only that reason, we are moving these amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that discriminating against people because of their gender, because of their age or because they have family responsibilities is wrong. There has never been any controversy about our commitment to that position. But our criticism of this proposed section and the reason we moved the four related amendments to delete it from the bill is that it is not a competent or effective way of dealing with discrimination. You do not competently attack the vice of discrimination in this society by treating as discrimination conduct which is not discrimination. To say that any decision of an employer which may have different effects or bearing upon people who have the responsibility of parents and people who do not have that responsibility is discrimination is foolish in the extreme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the ordinary experience of our lives that people who lead single lives and do not have family responsibilities lead different lives to those led by people who do have family responsibilities—in particular, responsibilities in relation to the care and nurture of children. We also know from the ordinary experience of our lives that what happens in the workplace will impinge upon people in those two different categories differently. That is just common sense. To identify the vice of discrimination in the fact that the experience or practice of the workplace might impinge differently upon people with family responsibilities and people without family responsibilities—which is inevitable in some circumstances—is to miss the point; it is to chase a shadow. e want to see those who would discriminate against people because of family responsibilities prohibited from doing so. You do not achieve that objective of social policy by in fact attacking something different which is so widespread and commonplace—that is, the fact that people who are single and people who have the responsibility of children lead different lives and have a different relationship with the workplace and that workplace practices might affect them differently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It saddens me that you attack the motives of the opposition, who, as I have said all along, have championed antidiscrimination. We seek to improve this legislation by drawing it back to its core value and its core legislative objective, which is to make it against the law of this country to discriminate against people, not to make it against the law of this country to run a workplace in which you have single people and parents and therefore, inevitably in the ordinary course of human life, the reality that decisions will affect people in each of those two categories differently and then to say that is the vice of discrimination.</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />We say that in practical effect that reasonableness test means that, if, for example, a food factory owner arbitrarily changes the starting time for all employees from 9 am to 7.30 am, this may be found to constitute discrimination because it would disproportionately disadvantage those employees with young children. However, it would not constitute discrimination if that same owner made the same change because the food produced in the factory has a limited shelf life and needs to be distributed to shops as early as possible before it goes off, because this change is reasonable in the circumstances.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, using the example of an employer who, due to economic downturn, equally cuts the hours of all casual staff, some of whom have children and some of whom do not, this would not constitute discrimination on the basis of family responsibilities because the action applied equally to all of the employees and it was reasonable in the circumstances. The fact that the workers with children may find it harder to cope with the reduced income is not relevant to the actions of the employer; it is exactly the same situation as two employees having different sized mortgages or different lifestyles or, indeed, different spending habits. Put simply, we say the proposed provisions do not require employers to take into account the living expenses of people with family responsibilities. For example, employers will not be required to pay a worker who has a family and therefore higher expenses more for the same job than a worker who does not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We say that section 7A relates to indirect discrimination against people with family responsibilities but indirect discrimination arises where an apparently mutual condition, requirement or practice has the effect of disadvantaging a particular group, in this case people with family responsibilities. We say that section 7B, the reasonableness test, means that common sense will prevail. We are not imposing further obligations upon the business community, let alone the small business community. You can be reassured that your concerns are dealt with through that reasonableness test.</span>

                    </a>  Pardon me, Senator Feeney. Through you, Madam Temporary Chairman, the problem with your response, Senator Feeney, is this: reasonableness is a defence. To use the example you have posited of an employer who changes the starting time from 9 am to 7.30 am, that will have a differential effect upon those of his employees who take their kids to school and those of his employees who do not have kids to take to school. I know this well. At 7.30 am on any day in Brisbane when parliament is not sitting I may be seen taking my boy to school. The dropping off of kids at school is, as most of us know, just part of the daily life of parents.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the starting time were to be changed and it had a differential impact on parents and single people, then proceedings could be brought under the act against the employer. It would then be thrown upon the employer to demonstrate that his or her decision was a reasonable decision. o the issue of reasonableness only starts to arise once the employer, the small business person—and we have been talking, in the context of this debate, in particular about small businesses with narrow margins, uncertain cashflows and usually not very deep capital resources—is already in the toils of the act, has already been proceeded against and then, in the appropriate tribunal, must defend themselves. Reasonableness is not an a priori part of this legislative scheme. So it is very little comfort to a small business operator who finds themselves being pursued under your proposed section 7A—after potentially spending tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawyers that they cannot afford, and spending days upon end of worry and distraction from their business which they cannot afford—at last to prepare a defence to the claim: 'Well, this was reasonable in the circumstances. So reason­ableness, as I say, sounds fine—as a legal practitioner myself, I know all about advancing arguments and mounting defences on the basis of the reasonableness of the conduct—but those arguments and defences are raised once it is already, in essence, too late for the small business operator.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, reasonableness is itself, as we all know, a very porous, open-textured concept. So, if we are to observe the good legislative practice of giving people certainty about the nature or extent of the obligations and burdens that we are imposing upon them, we should not think that we have discharged our duty by simply saying, 'If you can show reasonableness, you don't have a problem.'</span>

I make the comment also that the report, perhaps for reasons I do not understand, is limited. I hasten to add that the next report that I want to speak about, which is the same report for the next financial year, is a bit more effusive, but with the 2008-09 report, unless you knew what was happening you would not really have any idea of what the Royal Australian Air Force Welfare Recreational Company actually did or does.</span>

It wanted to make sure that anything that is government funded is able to be viewed by the public. Tabling this report some three years after the event is not good enough. I say with all due respect to you, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, but with no respect to the current government: this sort of poor accountability cannot be accepted. It is even more difficult to accept given that the current Prime Minister was elected on a mantra of openness and accountability. The words are easy to say; the actions are much harder. I think that this report, coming out some three years after the event, is typical of this government's lack of accountability and lack of openness in spite of the rhetoric.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note in this report, although it is a little late coming before the parliament, that the report does in this instance contain a chairman's report. I want to congratulate Air Com­modore Hewitson for the report and for the work he has done in relation to this trust over many years. The trust was established to provide for affordable holidays for members of the Australian Air Force. I must say that, as a senator of some longstanding in this parliament, I had never heard of this activity before. That is perhaps a criticism of me rather than of anyone else. From what I see in the chairman's report, it is a very useful organisation and it is one that I do want to learn a little more about. I understand from the chairman's report that the basis of activity for the trust is to provide affordable holidays for members of the Air Force, and that is a very creditable activity and one which I support. I note that the trust owns 11 units at the Ambassador Hotel on the Gold Coast, six apartments in the Tuscany apartment complex in Merimbula on the South Coast of New South Wales and one apartment in Darwin. The idea of providing assistance to service personnel at an affordable rate is to be commended, although I will look into this a bit further in relation to my role in the opposition in a small way in the Defence area. n the context of that general initiative, the Rotary Club of Surfers Paradise Central has for some years had a foundation going, the Ken Bromley Memorial Foundation, which provides holidays for wounded Defence Force personnel and their immediate families. Again, this is a foundation set up by Rotary and providing, as I understand it, fully recompensed holidays for wounded Defence Force personnel and their families. That is a very creditable approach from the Rotary Club of Surfers Paradise Central—one which, regrettably, does not get the publicity and recognition it deserves. Although Rotary Club members do not seek recognition or publicity, I wanted to say in this parliament: congratulations to them on the establishment of the Ken Bromley Memorial Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure—indeed, the honour—of being with the Rotary Club of Surfers Paradise Central recently. I spoke to a very fine gentleman, Colin Bannister OAM, who was very involved in this very creditable community service organisation. I am just sorry that, before that day, I was not aware of it. I am sure most Australians are not aware, and I suspect many members of the defence forces are not aware, of this foundation's activities. I want to congratulate the Rotary Club and, as much as I can, publicise the work of the Ken Bromley Memorial Foundation. I encourage our servicemen who have been wounded in action to contact the foundation. Surfers Paradise is a great place to have a holiday, and the Rotary Club will really looks after those members of the services who contact them to take advantage of what they offer. Congratulations, Rotarians on the Gold Coast. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

Unless they have been in this place for as long as I have, people would probably not remember the activities of the Natural Heritage Trust back in 2007-08.

                  </a>  Thank you. I did not quite get the interjection, but no doubt the interjection was made in embarrassment by a member of the government front bench over the lack of accountability of this government in reporting to parliament. This report for 2007-08 is really a report on the final years of the Howard government. It is up to the following government to get the report in, and that is why it is so late coming.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a look at the report brought back some nostalgia, some recollection of the good times for serious environment groups and conservation in our country. Reading this report demonstrates just what the Natural Heritage Trust did in a genuine way for Australia's environment and natural resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay credit to the advisory committee of the Natural Heritage Trust. Unfortunately, I do not have the document in front of me. I wanted to actually name those who were on the advisory committee at the time. It is a significant list of very prominent Australians who gave their time to assist in the natural resource management of Australia. The work they did in those days showed a genuine commitment to natural resource management—something that, I am disappointed to say, has almost disappeared under the Gillard and Rudd governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have now, thanks to the attendants, got the report before me. I want to particularly thank Sir James Hardy, who was chair of the advisory committee back in 2007-08, and the board members: Professor Peter Cullen, who has, regrettably, passed away; Ms Diane Tarte; Professor Jamie Kirkpatrick; Ms Pam Green; Mr Geoff Gorrie; Professor Bob Beaton; Mrs Roberta 'Bobbie' Brazil; Ms Melissa George; and Mr Kim Keogh. All are significant Australians who made a significant contribution to the management of our natural resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report deserves more attention than I am able to give it in the couple of minutes I have. I note, however, that the Auditor-General commented on this report. That Auditor-General's report is dated 4 September 2008. Unfortunately, this report is not dated. It is for 2007-08, but the Auditor-General saw it in September 2008 and it has taken almost three years for the Gillard government to get this report before the parliament. ow can the Gillard government claim any accountability or respect for parliament when it takes three years for a very simple report, dealt with by the Auditor-General three years ago, to get before this parliament? It is almost like reading old history. I would have liked to talk more about this report today but time will prevent me from doing so. Perhaps the only point I can really make, apart from congratulating those who were on the advisory board at the time, is to emphasise again the lack of accountability of the Gillard government. They have no interest in the environment, no interest in conservation and no interest in natural resource management.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I rise tonight to honour the memory of a friend and colleague, Ian Harrington. Ian leaves behind his wife of 42 years, Fran, his five children, Tricia, Cheryl, Linda, Michelle and Greg, and 14 grandchildren whom he adored and who adored him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian lived for his family. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. He was a modest man but a man of incredible strength and capacity. In his younger days he was a champion high-board diver, winning many state and national competitions. Such was his modesty that not many of his friends or colleagues knew of his skills and talent in this sporting field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian died recently of mesothelioma, contracted during his working life as a fitter. Mesothelioma is a horrible disease contracted by exposure to airborne asbestos fibres. It is a tragedy that Ian Harrington, who campaigned against the use of asbestos while he was a rank and file delegate and an elected official of the AMWU, became another working-class victim of asbestos related disease. Mesothelioma is a horrible, destructive disease that inevitably results in an agonising and debilitating death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The incidence of death from meso­thelioma is increasing. It afflicts Australians who have worked with asbestos in many industries, including manufacturing, engineering, our wharfs and the building industry. We should never forget that companies like James Hardy and CSR made huge profits from asbestos and from the suffering and devastation that this product brings to working-class Australians and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must continue to be vigilant and ensure that employers who expose workers to asbestos related disease are held to account through appropriate legislative and legal processes. Through the hard work of the trade union movement, all forms of asbestos have been banned since the end of 2003. Unfortunately, despite the ban asbestos is still common in many older houses. Ian would have wanted me to issue a general warning to all householders to be extremely careful if they come across asbestos in a domestic situation and to ensure its removal by properly trained personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian served his apprenticeship as a fitter and travelled the world as an engineer in the merchant navy. He worked for many years at Shell's Clyde refinery in the maintenance team. It was at the Shell refinery that he met his good mate David Hughes. David delivered a moving tribute to Ian at his recent funeral. David spoke of the kindness and support that Ian gave to him and everyone else that he came in contact with. The high regard in which Ian was held resulted in his election as the metal trades union delegate at Shell. Ian held that position for almost 15 years. In that time Ian gained the enormous respect not only of his workmates but also of other delegates in the oil industry and the union and of the employers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian was seen as a tough negotiator and an honest person, a voracious defender of workers' rights and conditions and one who would never back away from a dispute if workers' rights were being challenged. In his capacity as a highly competent union delegate, Ian was recognised by his union, the AMWU, where he became a union organiser, a position he held for 10 years. It was during this time that I became a friend and colleague of Ian's.  found Ian to be a tough and courageous organiser who would never leave you wondering what he thought. He was involved in many tough industrial disputes but always came out of them with the respect of his members and the employers. I have always said that a good union organiser instils confidence in their members, knows the benefits of education and training and fearlessly and tirelessly works for their members. If I was a worker in trouble I would have been extremely confident when Ian Harrington walked onto the job that my interests were going to be looked after by a tough, professional union official. Ian represented workers on the shop floor and as an advocate in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, where his capacity for research, preparation and advocacy helped thousands of workers over his career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian's trade skills were recognised by the former state and federal minister the Hon. Bob Debus when he seconded Ian to his office to help establish the trade courses that are now offered to TAFE students in New South Wales high schools as part of their curriculum. Ian spent his final few working years as a member services manager with the Superannuation Trust of Australia, now called Australian Super. Ian very quickly became an expert in superannuation matters and was a fantastic advocate for industry superannuation and the rights of workers to retire with dignity and security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian was nominated for Senior Australian of the Year for his ongoing contribution to the welfare of others during his lifetime. This was most appropriate, as Ian spent the major part of his life trying to improve the lot of working people, even after he retired. In his retirement, Ian enjoyed a couple of beers with his mates and fishing at Fingal Bay in New South Wales. My wife, Elaine, and I visited Fran and Ian in Fingal Bay not long after he had been diagnosed with mesothelioma. He had a lovely home, a loving wife, fantastic kids and wonderful grandkids. It is an absolute tragedy that asbestos and mesothelioma destroyed Ian's retirement and his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian was optimistic about his condition but also realistic. His good mate David noted that, when Ian was in the final stages of the disease, his strength and courage amazed everyone. Despite his personal battle with the horrible disease that is mesothelioma, Ian always had a genuine concern for others and was always wondering how he could help them with their problems. As David said, 'Let's not remember the way he died but, rather, how he lived—as a genuine and good man.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important also to remember that Ian was taken from his family and his friends by a disease that was avoidable. We must never forget that workers die while building this nation. I am sure that Ian and his family and the families of the thousands of workers who lose their lives through industrial accidents or industrial disease will applaud the decision of the government to honour the memory of workers who lose their lives while building this nation by building a national workers memorial in Canberra. People like Ian should be remembered for their efforts, and their families should have a place to remember them and contemplate their lives together when they visit the national capital. The memorial will be a fitting tribute to Ian and his fellow workers who have lost their lives as a result of their employment. I congratulate the Prime Minister and Minister Evans for supporting this important symbol of the nation's recognition of the sacrifice of workers. I pay tribute to the government, the coalition, the Greens and the Independents, who have worked together to ensure that a memorial for people like Ian Harrington will be built in the national capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vale, Ian Harrington. You were a good man, a union man and a great family man. You will be sadly missed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="KO6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUMPHRIES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I too rise to note the passing of a significant Australian. Mr Alan Fitzgerald passed away on 31 March 2011. Alan was a distinguished journalist, author and satirist. He was a founder and former president of the National Press Club and a member of the former ACT Advisory Council. He was one of the iconic characters of Canberra life during the period after the Second World War when this city was growing at a remarkable pace and was full of people who had come to live here from other parts of Australia. To feed the requirements of government departments, people were being shifted here from Melbourne, Sydney and the like. Canberrans had a common experience at that time as they began to populate this new city which was going rapidly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan was born in Sydney in 1935 and educated in Catholic schools in the eastern suburbs before going first into advertising and then into trade journalism. He came to Canberra in 1964 from Fiji, where he had edited the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fiji Times</span>. He was invited to write a satirical column for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span> by the paper's then editor, John Pringle, whom he had met while writing in London. This column made Alan Fitzgerald an immensely popular figure in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Fitzgerald's writing was very successful in part because his wry observations reflected the experience of most of his readers. At this time Canberra was burgeoning, with the population increasing by 10 per cent a year and a new suburb opening almost every month. Young public servants were arriving in Canberra, getting married and starting families, just as Alan and his wife, Maria, were themselves doing. Through common experience, and often shared frustration, Alan's satire helped to forge the character of a rapidly growing city. But he had a much wider audience than just the people living in the ACT. He also wrote opinion pieces for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sun-Herald</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Australian</span>; the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Observer</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Fitzgerald was a founder and early president of the National Press Club. He was president from 1969 to 1971 and remained active on the club's committee for many years. He was a member of the federal parliamentary press gallery. He was hired as a foreign correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Ottawa in 1974. He conducted his own current affairs program for nine years on Canberra radio station 2CA. He was also a frequent contributor to ABC radio programs and made regular appearances on Channel 7's breakfast program. In time he even became a publisher himself, presiding over the conservative periodical the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian National Review</span> for five years and establishing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Constitutional News</span>. He continued to be a prolific author all his life, writing thousands of satirical newspaper stories, hundreds of opinion pieces and a dozen humorous and historical books on Canberra. His son Julian, also a journalist, recently commented that almost until the day of his death his father was still reading newspapers and listening to current affairs. He published the satirical compilation <span style="font-style:italic;">Fitzgerald's Canberra: A Guide to Life in the National Capital</span>, which contained gems such as this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The longest distance between two points is a Canberra bus route … Bus routes are determined by the need to move the least number of people the longest distance in the maximum time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some would say that not much has changed in the intervening few decades. He, however, was never cruel or spiteful in his satire; it was a gentle ribbing of the city, its institutions and the way in which it worked. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many who moved to this city in its rapidly growing phrase, he loved the city and he knew it very well. For many years he was a member and chairman of the ACT Historic Sites and Building Committee, now the ACT Heritage Council, that had been established at his initiative to protect and preserve historic homesteads and buildings at a time of rapid expansion of the city into the surrounding rural area. Like so many adopted sons and daughters of this city, he was deeply in love with this place. Beyond his daily journalism he published a number of books on the history of Canberra, including <span style="font-style:italic;">Historic Canberra 1825-1945</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra's Engineering Heritage</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra and the New Parliament House </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra in Two Centuries—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Pictorial History</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was also involved in the public life of this city. That is somewhat ironic given that he spent a lot of time lampooning the institutions that he ultimately participated in and joined. He had a real dedication to the formation of the city of Canberra and to his fellow citizens, but I think he felt an obligation to remind them of the less serious side of that process while doing that. In 1967 he was elected to the pre-self-government ACT Advisory Council, an institution he had lampooned in his columns. He ran on the platform that he promised to do absolutely nothing, citing as his inspiration local politicians. This promise, I must say, was not kept. Once elected, Mr Fitzgerald took his role very seriously, working behind the scenes to help the Canberra community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With increasing respect and popularity in the Canberra community, he was twice fielded as a candidate for the Australia Party and ran for election in 1970 and 1972 in the federal seat of the Australian Capital Territory, as it was then known. Though he missed out both times, he is remembered for having gained the largest vote of any Australia Party candidate in an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He served as a director of the National Capital Development Commission, which of course was the precursor of today's National Capital Authority. That again may seem slightly ironic, given that he had lampooned the NCDC for many years. Of course, in that respect he was in very good company: virtually every Canberran had something unpleasant to say about the NCDC—at least until the time it disappeared, at which point everyone became very nostalgic about its role in the building of the city. For example, Alan wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In Canberra, even the mistakes are planned, by the National Capital Development Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, again, once in office in that role at the NCDC he was instrumental in improving Canberra, taking very seriously his role as a representative of the Canberra community in that way and ensuring that the city grew consistent with the character that was conceived for it and that reflected the needs of a living, breathing city and not merely a design-winning entry in a competition. He was also a foundation member and chairman of the ACT and region branch of the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy and played an active role in the debate about Australia becoming a republic in 1999.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said in his 2001 autobiography:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... my life had been shaped by living in the national capital in ways that I could not have imagined possible had I lived elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying that, once again, he exhibited this great ability to speak for many, many Canberrans. He was changed, as were thousands and thousands of people, by the experience of moving to this new, rather strange environment of the planned national capital. But as he grew and developed so did the city around him, and that embryonic relationship made an important difference to the way in which the city grew and became, in my humble opinion, one of the best places in Australia to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this occasion I believe we need to extend, as a chamber, our condolences to Alan's family, particularly his wife, Maria, and his sons, Dominic and Julian—and I see some of them in the chamber tonight—his six grandchildren, his extended family and his friends in their loss. He was more than simply a contributor; he was a man who chronicled and reflected the changing nature of the national capital at a critical time in its development. We would all certainly have been much, much poorer had he not been here, had he not written so prolifically about this city, had he not lifted the tone of the city with his comments and had he not made the contribution he made in so many ways to the institutions which were responsible for the development of the modern city of Canberra.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  On 17 January 2008, a two-year-old child, Dokthjan Saynaydet, was playing with his brother and seven other boys in their home town in Laos. They chanced upon an unexploded cluster submunition, or bomblet, left over from the years of fighting that ravaged their country. The war was long over, but this relic remained. The submunition exploded, killing the child's brother and three of the other boys, leaving him and four other bloodied children screaming in pain and terror from shrapnel injuries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1998, again in Laos, Phouvieng was digging in his garden and hit an unexploded cluster munition. It blew off his left arm and left leg. Fourteen-year-old Smajic found a cluster bomb in the woods while playing with friends in Bosnia in 1997. He lost his hand. Afghan student Rafeullah was 11 years old when he and his brother found a cluster bomb in 2002 which they believed to be a toy. It blew off his right hand. Zahra Soufan was also 11 when she found a cluster bomb, this time in Lebanon. She lost the fingers of her right hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2007, 17-year-old Rasha was watching television in Lebanon when her sister brought in a sack of thyme their father had just harvested. She reached into the bag and to her surprise pulled out what appeared to be a white ribbon. The cluster bomb inside the bag exploded, tearing her left leg to shreds. In that same country in 2006 a 34-year-old fisherman pulled in his net and the cluster bomb that was caught in it exploded, blowing off his hands and blinding him for life. This father of four was left a total invalid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the stories of the survivors; these are the 'lucky ones'. Every one of them was injured after the fighting in their country was over, and in some cases had been over for decades. Many, many more are killed and we do not know their names. Of the victims of submunitions from cluster bombs that do not explode on first impact, 98 per cent are estimated to be civilian. These weapons are indiscriminate. They remain a threat for decades after deployment. They are designed intentionally for maximum human casualties and maximum human suffering. As military doctrines have changed over the decades it has become apparent that these weapons are far more effective at killing children than they are at winning wars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Vietnam War ended 37 years ago but survivors of that war are still being harmed and killed by cluster munitions. There were 280 million cluster bombs dropped on Laos with an estimated 30 per cent failure rate, leaving approximately 80 million unexploded cluster bombs in that country alone. These weapons must be eradicated. Not reduced, not scaled back, not discouraged, but completely eliminated from the arsenals of every country in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This chamber will shortly debate a bill which ostensibly ratifies the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The treaty is an impressive legal document. Australia was at the front of the queue to sign it. We have played an important role in its creation and the treaty itself, as a tribute to many, many people who worked for a very long period of time, seeks to eliminate these weapons. It is a disarmament treaty. It bans the use, manufacture, stockpile, trade and investment with no exceptions. The first provision in the treaty is the most important: never under any circumstances. Proper adherence to this treaty expressly outlaws the presence of these weapons on Australian soil; it outlaws our military in assisting in the use of these weapons of indiscriminate destruction. Australia is one of the 108 countries that signed that treaty, and I am very proud to be part of that. The object and the purpose is universal disarmament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has had a long history, and often a proud one, in the creation of international treaties and arms control instruments of this kind. And so it is profoundly disturbing that the role of the Australian government in this treaty has been revealed to be so shameful. Senators are no doubt aware of the piece that ran in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> by Philip Dorling on 2 May this year that exposed the role of the Australian government's covert manoeuvres with the United States authorities to weaken the treaty—an extraordinary betrayal of the ideals behind the treaty and of the people who have worked so hard to bring it into legal effect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">WikiLeaks has again shown another example of just why the government is expressing so much outrage about the document drops that are coming from WikiLeaks and just how valuable they are. Every now and again you overturn one of these diplomatic stones and look at what is going on underneath it. Diplomatic cables from the US embassy have revealed the Australian government told the United States government in 2007 that it was prepared to withdraw from negotiations on a global ban if key issues to the United States, because Australia does not deploy these weapons and we never have, were not addressed—principally the inclusion of a loophole to allow signatories—that is, us—to cooperate with military forces still using cluster munitions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was reported in that same report that our authorities lobbied Asian countries, including Vietnam—what an extraordinary irony there—on the issue and sought advice from Washington on which African countries in which these horrific devices have also been deployed might be recruited to vote with Australia on parts of the treaty text. What an extraordinarily ugly episode in modern Australian history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that will shortly be before the Senate is therefore the expression of those behind-the-scenes negotiations where Australia was effectively doing the dirty work of a party that is refusing to sign and ratify that treaty. There is Australia doing the dirty work of the United States, which still sees these devices as having utility, these weapons that drop from aircraft or are fired from ground forces that then disperse into multiple explosive devices that get left behind on the battlefield or in metropolitan or civilian areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that the Senate will soon be debating allows the stockpiling and transfer of cluster bombs. It permits our forces to violate the spirit and intent of the treaty if the act involving cluster bombs is carried out in the course of a joint exercise with a non-party to the treaty, which is exactly what happened during Operation Desert Storm when we assisted the United States in the invasion of Iraq.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Harvard Law School's International Human Rights Clinic said this bill could be interpreted to: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… allow Australian military personnel to load and aim the gun, so long as they did not pull the trigger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser warns that the bill is 'scattered with alarming loopholes'. Former Australian Defence Force head Paul Barratt says this bill is now at odds with our obligations under international law. Some of us, perhaps naively—certainly naively—had assumed that perhaps it was sloppy drafting, that the Australian government was trying to be a little bit too cute. It has been revealed in the ugliest possible fashion that, no, it is entirely intentional and it is the result of a strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia must not make, use, distribute or assist in the use of cluster bombs and we must not allow the funding of cluster bombs. Australia's Future Fund, in a welcome recent development, divested from companies connected to the manufacture of cluster munitions. This was a positive step, but it actually goes beyond what is required under the bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank photojournalist John Rodsted, who is in the public gallery tonight, co-recipient of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, for providing some of the stories of the survivors. And I would also like to congratulate the work of the Cluster Munition Coalition and their allies and friends and supporters for the work they have done in getting us to where we are today.  have one final story. Soraj Ghulam Habib was 10 years old when he and his cousin came across a cluster bomb in Afghanistan. Soraj's legs were blown off and his cousin was killed. With his legs destroyed, covered in blood and unconscious, he was also believed to be dead. He was taken to the morgue, where his uncle realised he was still alive and rescued him. Soraj is here today and, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I welcome him to the Australian Senate's public gallery. He has come to Australia to urge us to adopt laws that will make real progress towards the eradication of these weapons forever. Soraj is calling on all governments to take a strong stand and to ban cluster bombs, with no exceptions, which I think is nothing more nor less than the Australian public would have anticipated when we signed this treaty in the first place. He has urged those who use, produce and transport munitions of this kind to stop and, in his words, 'to act as if your own children had such a distressed destiny'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a question of left or right; this is not something on which the crossbenchers plan to score political points off either of the major parties. It is a question of humanity against inhumanity. The Senate must fix this bill. We will shortly be given the opportunity to do just that. This is something that we are not looking back on in retrospect. This is not a proposal to amend an instrument that has already occurred or to come back and fix a mistake. We do have the opportunity before us, as parliamentarians and as representatives of a constituency that has not suffered the use of these weapons on Australian soil, to get this right the first time when we debate this bill shortly. The signs from the government and from the opposition thus far are not encouraging, but for some reason I still have a certain amount of hope that perhaps we can get this right. When the bill is debated we will put some amendments forward that do no more nor less than what the expert witnesses who appeared before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee recommended we do to bring the treaty into proper legal effect in Australia, as is happening overseas. I hope there is still time to get this right for the sake of people like Soraj, who have come to tell us their stories directly.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-State">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise to speak about one of those wonderful fundraisers that many politicians get involved in, and that is the Cancer Council's Relay for Life. I will specifically refer to the Cancer Council's Relay for Life that was held in Huonville in southern Tasmania. Firstly, I will give a bit of history about the Relay for Life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Relay for Life began in May 1985 when American colorectal surgeon Dr Gordy Klatt spent a gruelling 24 hours running and walking around a local oval in Tacoma, Washington, raising awareness of cancer. His efforts raised over $27,000, with people paying $25 to run or walk for 30 minutes with him. Since then, the event has spread across the USA and then across the globe. Relay for Life events are now held in more than 600 communities spanning 20 countries. Relay for Life began in Australia in 1999, when the Victorian community of Murrumbeena raised over $75,000 for the Cancer Council. This event is now held in every state and raises over $14 million annually. Money raised goes towards transport for patients, research grants, scholarships, cancer prevention, education, a helpline and various other important activities and services to reduce the incidence of cancer and support people living with the disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March I entered a team, Catryna's Crusaders, in the inaugural Huonville Relay for Life event in Australia's most southern municipality, the beautiful Huon Valley. The team consisted of family, friends and staff from my office. It is estimated that more than 370 walkers participated in total throughout the duration of the Huonville event. Catryna's Crusaders raised over $1,700 in just two weeks, so we are fairly proud of our support for the Cancer Council. The Huonville Relay for Life Committee had a goal of raising $30,000. This was well exceeded, with a total in excess of $59,000. That was an amazing effort, especially when you consider that it is one of four relay events in Tasmania, Huonville is much smaller than the major population centres and it was also the inaugural event for the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other parts of Tasmania, the Hobart event raised more than $341,000; Launceston, $219,000; and Penguin, on the north-west coast, over $271,000. That is a total of more than $890,000 raised by Tasmania, which I think is a terrific effort for such a small state. I am personally overwhelmed by the amount of support that Relay for Life receives each year in Tasmania, as does the Cancer Council in general. I think they are a great organisation and people in Tasmania are very appreciative of the work they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone participating in the Huonville event entered into the spirit of things in their own way. Some participants chose to dress up, with people wearing party hats, wigs, or dressed in animal suits and other costumes such as Spiderman and Darth Vader. My team had a purple theme, with balloons, streamers, a banner and a purple baton. We did have a bit of fun getting our tent and banner up, but they pleasingly did stay up for the whole event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The relay requires that each team has at least one member on the track for the duration of the event. We walked together as a team sometimes, while at other times there was only one member on the track. At 1.30 am, I walked for an hour or so and a young man, a 16-year-old, from one of the school teams I knew just ran out and joined me and walked around and around doing the laps with me. I thought that was impressive. Some members of the team jogged or ran but mostly it was a nice leisurely pace, great for keeping up the conversation. There was a real carnival atmosphere, with a jumping castle and carousel set up for the children. There were bands playing, a massage tent for participants, a tug-of-war challenge, and food available courtesy of the local Lions Club. It was wonderful to see so many people involved and to see people of all ages taking part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention the highest fundraisers for the Huonville event. Gary Smith won the individual award for raising $4,029, while the Black Rods team—yes, there was a team called the Black Rods, from the Legislative Council in Tasmania—raised $7,112.50. It was a remarkable effort by everyone concerned.  number of teams were involved in this event. They were: the Huonville Pharmacy; the Huon Valley Little Athletics; the Black Rods—as I said, from Tasmanian Legislative Council; Woolies Huonville; A Law Unto Themselves—which is a firm of lawyers in the local area, Baker Wilson Lawyers; The Bankers Dozen from the ANZ Bank; Lucaston Park Orchards; The Council Crusaders, who were from the Huon Valley Council; Sacred Heart Catholic School, Geeveston; The Bendy Go-Gos, the Bendigo Community Bank; Huon Valley Aquatic; A Drop of Red, the Red Cross; The Flintstones, which is Duggans Earthmoving Equipment; and the St James Flames, St James Catholic College. Prizes were also awarded for a number achievements. Lucaston Park Orchards won the prize for the most laps, Bankers Dozen won best baton and the Black Rods team won best uniform. Huon Valley Little Athletics won the best campsite, while best team name went to A Law Unto Themselves—as I said, a local legal group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a great sense of fun and camaraderie, but everyone knew that we were there to raise money and awareness for cancer. And, of course, we were there to pay tribute to all those people who have fought cancer, those we have lost, those who have triumphed and those who are currently battling the disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opening ceremony included the <span style="font-style:italic;">Relay Oath</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Survivors' Dedication</span> by Miss Barbara Greenstreet. The ribbon was cut by the mayor of the Huon Valley, Councillor Robert Armstrong. The opening ceremony was followed by the first lap of the event, known as the Survivors' Walk. As a survivor of cancer, I had the privilege of participating in the front row of the walk and helping to hold the banner. It was really wonderful to see so many survivors wearing their purple sashes as well. We were then joined in the walk by carers and other participants for the next lap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know the statistics about cancer, but to see so many survivors and their carers in the one place really does bring home to everyone how many people are touched by cancer. On the Saturday night there was a luminary session ceremony, where people could light a candle to remember all those people who have passed away following the battle with cancer. The closing ceremony on the Sunday included Mrs Megan Graham, a team member of the Black Rods, sharing her cancer experience in a very moving speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved with Relay for Life: the organisers, including the Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Council Tasmania, Mr Darren Carr and his team; the Lions Clubs of Huon and Port Cygnet and the Kingborough/Huon Rural Youth Club; all the participants, of course; and the many people who donated so generously of their time, their money and their hard work and effort. Thank you also to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Huon Valley News</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>for the wonderful coverage of the event both in the lead-up and following that event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say a special thanks to the other members of Catryna's Crusaders: my husband Robert; my staff, Daniel Hulme, Gabrielle Morrison, Brooke Eastley and Scott Faulkner. Other members of the team were: Jeffrey Gough, Colleen Smith, Leah Triffett, Emily Brinckman, Caleb Irwin, Fiona Emmett, David O'Byrne MP and Josephine Sinclair and her children Teagan, Chloe and Toby. Teagan, Chloe and Toby did not stay that long, but they did do a few a laps and they gave me some money that the children had raised through the neighbourhood and the school in the preceding week. It was about $70, and I think that deserves a special mention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point I would also like to acknowledge Senators Furner, Moore, Stephens and McEwen for their generous donations to the Catryna's Crusaders team. I know that Senator Furner regularly has his own team in Relay for Life and raises a considerable amount of money for the Cancer Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cancer Council has decided to hold the Huonville event again in 2012, and I look forward to participating and raising even more money for this very worthwhile cause.</span>

To the extent that that employee entitlements are covered by GEERS, employees would receive no additional advantage by receiving a higher priority in the distribution. Almost all employee entitlements are covered by GEERS. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Commonly, a receiver is appointed as part of the contract between the bank and the borrower. A receiver is required by law to be a registered liquidator. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">A receiver is primarily obligated to look after the interests of the secured creditor who appointed them. However, the Corporations Act 2001 also requires them to take reasonable steps to attempt to sell charged property for not less than its market value or, if there is no market value, the best price reasonably obtainable. In addition, they are under an obligation to incur only reasonable and necessary costs. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this, their conduct is subject to a range of duties that apply to company officers in general. Receivers are afforded a high degree of independence in the manner in which they carry out their functions. The Courts have the power to review and intervene in the manner in which they legally carry out their functions.</span>

The guidelines set out the rules regarding: what a debt collector can do with a debtor's personal information, how a debt collector can contact a debtor (including debtors with a special disadvantage) and the role of independent external dispute resolution schemes. The Commonwealth also has in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010  laws to prohibit the use of physical force, unconscionable conduct, undue harassment and coercion in debt collection. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In 2009, the Government enacted the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 including the National Credit Code, which introduced for the first time, a nationally consistent legislative regime for the regulation of consumer credit. Section 59 of the National Credit Code makes any guarantee unenforceable unless the credit provider has given the guarantor a copy of the contract document and subsequently obtained the guarantor's written acceptance.  Therefore under the Commonwealth's legislation, banks can not use an 'all monies clause' to attach a debt to people who are not aware that they are responsible for the guarantee of a third party. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Can an explanation be provided and substantiated as to how this figure was derived when the Future Fund Actuary estimated the liability to be $96.3 billion for the 2009-10 financial year, and the department itself was quoted on page 34 of the Matthews Review report (Review of pension indexation arrangements in Australian Government civilian and military superannuation schemes, by Mr Trevor Matthews, dated December 2008) to have estimated the figure to be $100.3 billion as of 30 June 2008.</span>

However, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) clearly states in its document 4102.0 (dated 7 August 2007) that 'Purchasing Power' and 'material living standards' are directly proportional to 'real national disposable income per capita' and 'real national net worth per capita', in other words, purchasing power is directly proportional to income and net worth after inflation. Given this does the Minister agree with the ABS analysis and definition of 'Purchasing Power'; if not, is there a preferred alternative.</span>

                  </a>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Australia is a supporting member country of EITI. Australia provides funding, through the aid program, to support developing countries implement EITI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) EITI is a global initiative promoting the disclosure by both governments and companies of revenue payments relevant to the mining, gas and petroleum sectors. Countries participate in the EITI process on a voluntary basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, each government jurisdiction has its own regulations and financial disclosure obligations. All Australian Government agencies comply with internationally accepted accounting standards and are subject to the Australian National Audit Office. Corporations are regulated under the Corporations Act 2001. Payments made by the mining, oil and gas companies operating in Australia and receipted by the Australian Government are publicly disclosed through these mechanisms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) AusAID has contributed a total of $1.45m to the World Bank administered EITI Multi-Donor Trust Fund, which supports implementation of EITI in developing countries. AusAID has allocated a further $9m over three years for the EITI MDTF. AusAID has also allocated $1m over three years for the EITI Secretariat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The Government, in conjunction with industry and civil society, is considering the issues around the EITI and its domestic implementation, noting the response to Question 2. The Government has yet to conclude its consideration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) The Commonwealth Government is responsible for considering whether Australia becomes an implementing country, although aspects of implementation may be the responsibility of, and may require the agreement of, state and territory governments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(6) The Government is aware of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 2010 and its impact on the Securities Exchange Act 1934. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is not considering implementing similar extra-territorial legislation in Australia as it considers that initiatives such as the Dodd-Frank Act do not demonstrably reduce corruption.

                  </a>  The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The Government considered a range of options to provide the full suite of digital television channels to self help viewers, including terrestrial and satellite transmissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The Government considers that satellite is an efficient and effective means of delivering digital television to remote communities. Terrestrial self-help retransmission facilities have a number of limitations that do not apply to satellite: they impose on-going, and not always predictable, costs on local communities and councils for their operation and maintenance; they have an inflexible coverage area which cannot accommodate population shifts beyond the area served by the transmitter; and they can be subject to extended outages when there are transmitter faults if licensees have difficulty accessing spare parts and/or experienced technicians, particularly when transmitters are located in isolated or remote areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) The Government decided to fund a satellite service to provide digital television in signal deficient areas, and has implemented the Satellite Subsidy Scheme to assist people in self help communities cover the cost of moving to satellite if the self help facility is not converted to digital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The Government will subsidise a large part of the cost of installing VAST equipment by eligible households under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme. Under the Scheme, the direct cost to the household is only around $200-$350 depending on location. This includes remote households currently served by analog self-help services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Households not eligible for the Scheme subsidy must initially purchase and install equipment, but the ongoing costs are only those arising from any repairs to or replacement of a set top box or satellite dish when and as needed. In return these households will receive 16 channels of digital television plus a news service, a significant improvement over what they would have previously received.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(7) Under the funding arrangements agreed to by the Government for the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, it is not possible to redirect funding from the Scheme for other purposes, such as making payments to licensees to upgrade self-help facilities.</span>

For example, it has retired over 500 desktop printers, introduced new centralised 'print on demand' technology, defaulted all printers capable of duplex printing to duplex and encouraged staff to limit the volume of printed material. In addition, the department has adopted a paper sustainability policy which focuses on purchasing 80% recycled A4 paper and 10% recycled A3 paper.</span>
