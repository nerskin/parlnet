Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese Communist regime since <span style="font-weight:bold;">July 1999</span>, causing thousands to lose their lives from illegal detention and systematic torture. Such conduct stands in blatant violation to all international human rights charters that the Chinese government has itself ratified. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific; David Kilgour, tens of thousands of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to <span style="font-weight:bold;">forced organ harvesting</span> for China's transplant market and lost their lives ( www.organharvestinvestigation.net ).</span>

A successful relatively high personal top tax had been in operation from 1950 to 1970, 66.6% and was well received by the workers but apparently did not relate to the 30% of GDP.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government values the significant contribution made by overseas trained doctors in the delivery of health services in Australia, particularly in rural and remote areas.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS) for health professions commenced on 1 July 2010 and is the result of an agreement between the state, territory and Commonwealth governments, through the Council of Australian Governments, to align the previously disparate state and territory registration schemes for health practitioners. Key aims of the NRAS include increasing public safety and providing mobility for health practitioners.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While the NRAS is a national scheme, it operates independently of the Commonwealth. It is a joint initiative of the state, territory and Commonwealth governments, undertaken through the Council of Australian Governments. Oversight of the operation of the Scheme is provided by the Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Council (the Ministerial Council), which consists of Health Ministers from the state, territory and Commonwealth governments.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the NRAS, there is a single national registration board for each participating health profession. Members of a national board discharge their responsibilities under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009, known as the National Law. The national boards are supported in their role by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulatory Authority (AHPRA), an independent statutory agency. It is not appropriate for me to intervene directly in the workings of either the national boards or AHPRA.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the NRAS, the previous state and territory medical registration boards have been replaced by a single national board, the Medical Board of Australia (MBA). The MBA has responsibility for the registration of medical practitioners; development of professional standards for medicine; handling notifications and complaints; and the assessment of overseas trained practitioners.</span>

This will support up to an additional 1000 schools from the beginning of 2012 and enable all schools currently funded under the Program to be extended to 2014. The additional 1000 places include schools in disadvantaged, rural and remote communities.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 12 May 2011 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding a request for a street posting box at the Miami Village Shopping Centre in Falcon, Western Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post does not receive any funding from taxpayers and, as far as practicable, it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post has noted that its policy concerning the provision of street posting boxes takes into account the general increased mobility of the population, constant demographic changes, shifts in posting habits and Australia Post's Community Service Obligation commitment to offer reasonable postal network access to its customers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The policy provides that in capital city metropolitan areas and provincial cities, a street posting box facility will be provided at or near all postal outlets. In addition, street posting boxes will be provided so that residents have access to a lodgement point within two kilometres. In providing posting facilities, Australia Post gives preference to sites where adequate postings can be anticipated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post has advised that there are three street posting boxes within a reasonable distance of the Miami Village Shopping Centre:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post acknowledges the points outlined in the petition presented by the local community but, based on the existing level of demand in the area, it considers that the reasonable posting needs of the local community are being met by the current spread of posting facilities and that the provision of an additional posting box cannot be justified at this time. Australia Post will continue to monitor postage services in the Falcon area to ensure that additional services are provided as the need arises.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 25 May 2011 forwarding to me a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions about restrictions on commercial and recreational fishing in Australian waters.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the concerns about marine reserves and potential restrictions on commercial and recreational fishing in waters off New South Wales seem to relate to the state marine park process rather than the Commonwealth marine bioregional planning process.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to a clear and transparent process involving broad consultation and engagement with all stakeholders to help identify areas that are important for commercial and recreational marine users.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth marine bioregional planning process that will determine the marine reserve network for Commonwealth waters (usually three nautical miles from shore) is principally a matter for the Hon. Tony Burke MP, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water and Population—except for Great Barrier Reef Marine Park matters, which are managed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is expected that those marine users, including commercial, recreational and charter fishers, who could be displaced will be consulted and treated fairly should there be unavoidable impacts as a result of the bioregional planning process. The government's policy also provides for various zoning arrangements, including multiple-use zones, that will allow commercial and recreational fishing activities that are compatible with habitat protection to continue.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Minister Burke recently announced a proposed marine reserve network for Commonwealth waters in the south-west region. The release of the east marine bioregional plan and associated marine reserves is scheduled for later this year. Information on marine bioregional planning and the proposed reserve system is available at www.environment.gov.au/coasts /mbp/index.html.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I have also been advised that areas for further assessment have been identified in the east marine region to gather more information on biological, physical and socioeconomic uses. This process will help to narrow down the areas where marine reserves may be established.</span>

As well as affecting the individual employee and other workers and their families, it can result in other undesirable outcomes such as absenteeism, increased staff turnover and loss of productivity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although most current work health and safety laws do not specifically address workplace bullying, all occupational health and safety (OHS) Acts impose legal responsibilities on both employers and employees. For example, under section 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth) employers must take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety of the employer's employees. This duty of care requires employers to take proactive steps to identify those hazards with the potential to affect the health and safety of their employees and to implement measures to eliminate or control the risks arising from those hazards. The duty extends to psychosocial hazards in the workplace including bullying behaviours.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Comcare, the Commonwealth OHS regulator, have provided guidance material on bullying which can be found on the following website at <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="">www.comcare.gov.au</a>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">In terms of future workplace safety laws, the harmonisation of Work Health and Safety (WHS) laws is a priority area of regulatory reform. All governments have committed to adopt uniform WHS laws by 1 January 2012, complemented by nationally consistent approaches to compliance and enforcement.</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Safe Work Australia, an independent body representing each jurisdiction, unions and industry, was established to drive the development and implementation of these model WHS laws (comprising of a model act, supported by model WHS regulations and model codes of practice). The model WHS Act will cover bullying under its general provisions, and criminal penalties will apply for certain offences under the Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Safe Work Australia is currently working on a package of draft model regulations and draft priority codes of practice to support the agreed model Act. Safe Work Australia have indicated to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations that it is currently in the process of drafting a code of practice on the subject of workplace bullying, including a section on violence in the workplace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All codes will be available for public comment in the future prior to implementation. These codes form part of the model WHS laws which jurisdictions have committed to implement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The model codes of practice aim to provide practical guidance to duty holders on how to meet the requirements under WHS legislation. Once implemented, these codes of practice will be approved under each jurisdiction</span>

                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">
                </span>regulations. Courts may regard a code of practice as evidence of what is known about a hazard, risk or control and may rely on the code in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances to which the code relates. This means that a code of practice relating to workplace bullying would be able to be used as evidence in proceedings for an offence under the WHS Acts in all Australian jurisdictions. This reflects the Government's commitment to ensuring that workers across Australia have the same WHS protections wherever they reside.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">School and Workplace Bullying</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr Murphy</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 23 May 2011 concerning the school and workplace bullying petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions. My response addresses matters raised in the petition relating to the School Education, Early Childhood and Youth portfolio. Your petition has also been forwarded to Senator Chris Evans, Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, to respond to matters relating to bullying in the workplace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes issues of bullying seriously and believes student and workplace wellbeing and safety are essential for education and career success. All Australians should be able to learn and work in safe and supportive environments. The Government is committed to ensuring the wellbeing and resilience of all schoolchildren. Planning is underway to begin work to develop a national approach to building student resilience and wellbeing. This work recognises that schools play a vital role in promoting the intellectual, physical, social, emotional, moral, spiritual and aesthetic development and wellbeing of young Australians, and in ensuring the nation's ongoing economic prosperity and social cohesion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You would be aware that state and territory governments have responsibility for the provision of education in their respective jurisdictions. Whilst the Government provides funding to state and territory governments for the provision of education, the Government does not currently legislate for the day to day operation of individual schools. The introduction of legislation to deal with school bullying may be better addressed by seeking the agreement of state and territory governments to amending their existing education legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Quite separately, there are state, territory and Australian Government laws in place that deal with industrial relations, occupational health and safety, and discrimination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As noted in the petition, there is often a direct link between bullying and sexual harassment. I am pleased to note that amendments introduced by the Attorney-General which strengthen the protections against sexual harassment for students in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 were passed by Parliament on 24 May 2011. They will enter into force upon receiving Royal Assent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The changes will extend the prohibition on sexual harassment in schools to protect students under the age of 16 from harassment by adult students. They will also provide for the first time protection for students from harassment by adult students and staff from other institutions during inter-school events such as sports carnivals and school formals.</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, this means that all students will be better protected from sexual harassment, whether it occurs in the schoolyard, online or through covert forms of bullying, such as text messaging.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where bullying is linked to or based on attributes including a person's sex, disability, race, age, sexual preference, criminal record, trade union activity, political opinion, religion or social origin, it may be covered under federal and state anti-discrimination legislation. Further information on this legislation is available at the Australian Human Rights Commission's website at <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="">www.humanrights.gov.au</a>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of a national approach to supporting schools to build, safe school communities, the Government has collaborated with state and territory education authorities to review and launch the revised National Safe Schools Framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The revised Framework was endorsed by all ministers for education through the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs in December 2010. The Framework provides Australian schools with a vision and a set of guiding principles to assist whole school communities to develop positive and practical student safety and wellbeing policies. The vision includes creating learning environments which are free from all forms of bullying, harassment, aggression and violence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Framework's whole of school approach to creating safe and supportive learning and teaching communities acknowledges the strong interconnections between student safety, student wellbeing and learning. It emphasises the need for teachers to have appropriate training in positive student management and the need for schools to respond to incidents as they occur. It also acknowledges the role of parents and carers and includes ways for them to become involved with their child's school and continuously promote a safe school environment. By involving this important group of people, a whole school community approach to promoting safe schools can be established.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I proudly launched the revised Framework on 18 March 2011 on the inaugural National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence. On this day, the Framework and the online supporting resource manual were made available to all Australian schools. Further information about the National Safe Schools Framework is available at: www.safeschools.deewr.gov.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the National Day of Action, an online social networking campaign, Take a Stand Together, went live at www.takeastandtogether.gov.au. This campaign focuses on bystander behaviour and raises awareness of how students can take positive action against bullying.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also worked with state and territory education authorities to develop the Bullying. No Way! website at www.bullyingnoway.com.au. This interactive website provides valuable information for parents, students and teachers on strategies to address bullying, harassment and violence.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2011 regarding a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions about nursing home care and bed funding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the petition was presented by the Member for Petrie, Mrs Yvette D'Ath MP, on 26 May 2011. Under Standing Order 209 (b), as the Minister responsible for the administration of the matter raised in the petition, I am responding within 90 days of its presentation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that older people receive high quality care and an appropriately skilled and motivated workforce is a key part of this. It recognises that aged care workers provide an invaluable service in the care of older people and will be an integral part of meeting the challenges of responding to the care needs of an ageing population. The Government recognises that a sustainable aged care sector is essential to this commitment. That is why it has budgeted more than $54.2 billion to support the aged care needs of older Australians over the next four years from 2011-12.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Good faith collective bargaining at the enterprise level is at the heart of the Government's new workplace relations system. These workplace reforms have delivered a framework that provides greater opportunities for all workers, including aged care workers, to negotiate enterprise agreements that improve wages and conditions as well as workplace productivity and flexibility. Employees such as aged care workers who have previously had limited access to multi-employer bargaining will be able to benefit from the Government's low-paid bargaining stream which encourages a cooperative approach to workplace relations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government has an overarching role as funder of programs and services, aged care providers are responsible together with their staff to negotiate wages and conditions. The pay rates for workers are often negotiated through collective agreements and can vary from employer to employer, just as they do for nurses working in hospitals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Aged Care Act 1997, aged care providers are responsible for ensuring that there are adequate numbers of appropriately skilled staff to meet the individual care needs of residents. The number of staff that is appropriate for a given number of aged care recipients will vary across aged care homes and change according to the mix of residents' needs in that home. The required ratio of staff to residents and the required skills sets of staff are influenced by factors such as the nature of the care and service needs of residents, the nature of the buildings, the way the work is organised and the extent to which some services are conducted in-house or are outsourced.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The Government recognises that there are challenges facing the aged care sector and that reform is essential to build a more sustainable system that older Australians can rely on, providing high quality, affordable care into the future.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 23 May 2011 about the River Nile Learning Centre petition for payment of the Baby Bonus during pregnancy. I welcome ongoing suggestions from organisations such as yours, about how to enhance our policies and service delivery.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing financial support to families to assist with the costs associated with a newborn or adopted child. It also recognises the additional challenges faced by families on low incomes and have recently introduced improvements to access and delivery of the Baby Bonus.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2011, a larger portion of the Baby Bonus is paid in the first instalment to help parents to meet upfront costs such as a pram, child car restraints and other essential high cost items. The first instalment of the Baby Bonus is now $500 higher than the subsequent 12 instalments, rather than payment in 13 equal instalments. The subsequent fortnightly instalments help families to meet other recurrent costs.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 January 2011, the Government also introduced the Paid Parental Leave scheme, which gives more babies the best start in life and gives parents the financial security to spend more time at home with their new baby. The scheme has been fully costed and is funded by the Government. It provides Parental Leave Pay for 18 weeks at the rate of the National Minimum Wage (currently $570 a week before tax) to eligible working parents whose child is born or adopted on or after 1 January 2011.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The early claim process provides convenient access to family payments including the Baby Bonus and Paid Parental Leave. Families can make an early claim up to 97 days before a child's expected date of birth or before the date a child will be entrusted into their care. This means that an initial assessment of eligibility can occur before birth or before a child is entrusted into care and families only have to provide proof of birth or confirmation that a child has entered care in order to start receiving payment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The comments and suggestions made in the submission will be considered by the Government as it continues to monitor and review the family payments system to ensure that family payments are effective and appropriate in providing support to Australian families and their changing needs.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this, the government has introduced a Satellite Subsidy Scheme that provides assistance to these households in regional and remote areas to move to the VAST satellite service. This is the case with the households currently dependent on the re-transmission facility at Wandoan.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is providing a subsidy of $400 per household in defined 'standard' areas, $550 in defined 'very remote' areas and $700 in defined 'far north tropical' areas across Australia. Cabinet agreed to these three tiers of subsidy, as they reflect the difference per household's average costs likely to be incurred, depending on where the household is located. This will result in one flat co-payment across all of Queensland. Households in Wandoan may be eligible for a $400 subsidy. The subsidy can be accessed by using the Government contracted installer and not by cash or reimbursement.</span>

                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">After the subsidy, eligible households in regional and remote Queensland will pay $220. This is a one-off cost, paid directly to the installer, and there are no ongoing fees to receive the VAST satellite service.</span>

People with more than one television who move to the VAST service will have to put in additional cabling and set-top boxes at their own expense, although the same dish can be used for a number of televisions. This is not substantially different from what people with more than one television in metropolitan and regional areas throughout Australia who receive their television services terrestrially will have to do to receive digital television.</span>

This will assist householders to save on any additional call-out fees. The price of these additional services has been approved by the government.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to its operational network.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post has advised that its policy in determining whether additional postal outlets are required takes a number of factors into account, including the location and viability of existing outlets and the volume of business likely to be transacted.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In April 2011, in response to representations for an LPO in Eaton Fair Shopping Centre, Australia Post reviewed the postal needs of the local residents. Australia Post concluded that with the Eaton LPO located 1.5 kilometres from the suggested site and six other postal outlets within a 7.5 kilometres radius, the provision of an additional LPO could not be justified.</span>

This offers customers an increased range of postal products and services and enables Australia Post to monitor closely the current and future postal usage in the area.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Hon Stephen Smith MP, concerning the petition presented by the Member for Solomon, Mrs Natasha Griggs MP, on 30 May 2011 requesting House of Representatives support to excise from Commonwealth ownership the residential housing area of Royal Australian. Air Force (RAAF) Base Darwin and hand these houses over to Northern Territorians for a range of housing options. As this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your correspondence has been passed to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">RAAF Base Darwin is critical to support of military operations in defence of Australia and for other regional tasks. To enable the base to fulfil its role, the Department of Defence needs to develop appropriate facilities and infrastructure on the base to support current and future capabilities and contingency requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of the housing pressures in Darwin, the Government directed Defence to review its requirement to retain the land currently allocated for housing. This review recommended that this land should be retained by Defence for development of facilities and infrastructure to support the role of the base. This recommendation has been agreed by the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In considering the outcomes of the review the Government has also agreed that 8.7 hectares of this land will be developed for on-base housing for members of the Australian Defence Force. This development, to be completed by Defence Housing Australia, will see approximately 130 new detached residences constructed on the base.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of the overall housing situation in Darwin, this development, together with the construction of Defence housing in the suburb of Muirhead and at Larrakeyah Barracks, will assist in alleviating the current general shortage of housing in the Darwin area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the role of RAAF Base Darwin and the requirement for Defence to be able to develop infrastructure to support this role, and the steps being taken by the Government to alleviate the housing shortage in Darwin through construction of Defence housing, I wish to advise the Committee that the Government does not support the petitioner's request for excision of the land from Commonwealth ownership.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 4 July 2011, concerning a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the removal of horses from Malabar Headland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The terms of this petition are such that the petitioners object to the termination of the Malabar Riding School's licence to occupy the Commonwealth owned Malabar Headland site, effective 31 October 2011. The petitioners also request that the House grant a portion of the land at Malabar Headland for use as an equestrian sports facility.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to issue termination notices at Malabar Headland occurs in the context of concerns about a diverse range of health and safety risks. These include, but are not limited to, contamination arising from previous and current usage of the site, and trip and fall hazards. Licensees cannot continue to use the site because the safety of all users is the Commonwealth's priority. Notwithstanding the Commonwealth's health and safety responsibilities, it would be very difficult for the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance), as landlord, to mitigate the risks on the site if licensees were to continue their use of the site during any such mitigation process.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Due to these mounting health and safety concerns, Finance issued termination notices to the licensed users of the site, giving six months notice to vacate the property by 31 October 2011. This period of notice is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licences.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The formal intention to transfer Malabar Headland to the NSW Government has been on the public record since the 2007 federal election campaign. In August 2010, the Commonwealth reiterated a commitment to transfer parts of the site to the NSW Government for conservation purposes. In February 2011, the Commonwealth and NSW Governments signed agreements to formalise and progress the transfer.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the petitioners' concern to protect and promote the interests of the equestrian activities in the region; however, I must also have regard to the Commonwealth's stated intention to transfer the Malabar site, health and safety responsibilities, and the views of other stakeholders, including state and local governments and other community groups.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Finance is continuing to consult with licensed users to facilitate vacation of the site by 31 October 2011. I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee.</span>

Today's presentation included 30 petitions, representing the views and concerns of a total of 60,316 citizens. The variety and, indeed, the volume of petitions presented today demonstrate the wish of many Australians to express their opinions to the House in this traditional way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These petitions express a broad range of views held by citizens from all walks of life, residing in various parts of the country. The views included, for example, are as diverse as foreign affairs, battery hen farming and aircraft noise regulations. Petitions also hailed from a variety of places—from Broken Hill to metropolitan Melbourne. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On sitting Mondays at this time, I present petitions in my role as chair of the petitions committee. Before petitions are presented, the committee assesses whether they meet specific requirements of House standing orders. The committee neither endorses nor rejects petitions on the basis of the views expressed in them. It respects the rights of all petitioners to express their views to the House, and to have their petitions tabled—so long as they conform to the rules of the House. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same way that any member who lodges or presents a petition may or may not support its aims, in my capacity as chair I may present petitions that I do not necessarily agree with. However, my role, and indeed the role of all members of the House of Representatives, is framed by the standing orders of the House and its respect for freedom of speech. Thank you.</span>

The chairman might like to consider that ministerial responses as listed will be presented on the committee's website, and that might be for the consideration of the committee.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the listing of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">AQAP </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">listing of six terrorist organisations</span>. This report reviews the initial listing of the terrorist organisation known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the relisting of six previously listed terrorist organisations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the dissolution of the 42nd Parliament and the 2010 federal election, advice to the committee from the Attorney-General's Department of the new listing and the relistings was unavoidably delayed and the committee was therefore unable to review these organisations and report to the parliament within the disallowance period. However, the committee resolved to review the new listing of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the relisting of six other terrorist organisations and report to parliament, albeit outside the disallowance period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having completed its review, I can advise that the committee would not have recommended disallowance of the regulations for any of these seven organisations had the committee been able to complete its review within the disallowance period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with previous committee reports on listings and relistings and terrorist organisations, this report identifies issues relating to the current nature and reach of each of the organisations, with particular emphasis in the case of the six relistings on developments since the committee last reviewed these organisations. Information was drawn from the statement of reasons provided by the Attorney-General's Department and, when required, as on this occasion, from a private hearing with the Attorney-General's Department and ASIO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned above, this is the first listing of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as AQAP. The committee took evidence that AQAP has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks in the Arabian Peninsula, both within and outside Yemen. The committee noted that in February this year the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Correspondent</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>television program reported that Yemen is 'Al Qaeda's new frontier, and a launching pad for Jihadi inspired terrorism' and that the leader of AQAP, Anwar Al-Awlaki, is drawing recruits from many nations around the world, including Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence has recently confirmed the activities of AQAP and its links to Australia as described in <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Correspondent</span>. Terrorist attacks which AQAP have recently claimed responsibility for include one on 7 January this year, when 12 soldiers were killed when AQAP militants attacked three military vehicles in the city of Lawdar in Yemen. On 29 October last year, two improvised explosive devices were sent from Yemen using international courier companies and were intercepted in the United Kingdom and in the United Arab Emirates. The devices were disguised as packages and were addressed to synagogues in Chicago. AQAP claim responsibility for sending these devices. In claiming responsibility for the attempted IED attacks mentioned above, AQAP further claimed to have been responsible for the downing of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai in early September 2010 in which two crew members were killed. On 23 July 2010, AQAP militants ambushed a military patrol in the Shabwah province in Yemen, killing six soldiers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found that AQAP is engaged in activities that satisfy section 102.1 of the Criminal Code. The committee would have not recommended disallowance of the regulations to list AQAP. This is the fourth relisting of al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah, al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Jamiat ul-Ansar and the Abu Sayyaf Group, and it is a third relisting of al-Qaeda in Iraq. In each case, the committee was satisfied that each of these groups continues to engage in terrorist activities which could be a threat to Australia or Australian interests here or overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note that in reviewing the evidence in support of the listings the committee draws largely on the statement of reasons which is prepared by ASIO in conjunction with the Attorney-General's office. However, completion of the statement of reasons would normally be at least one or two months prior to the committee writing its report, so in order to take into consideration the very latest information about each group the committee often refers to information on Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre website to support the evidence provided in the statement of reasons, and therefore information may be contained in this report which is more up to date than that which is contained in ASIO's statement of reasons. To sum up, I reiterate that if the committee had been able to report within the disallowance period it would not have recommended disallowance of the regulations in relation to any of the seven terrorist organisations mentioned above.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of the committee members, particularly the deputy chair, for their work in reviewing these terrorist organisations. Lastly, I would like to thank the secretariat. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I take the opportunity of endorsing the comments of the chair. It was unusual, because of the nature of the dissolution of the parliament and the reconstitution of the new parliament and the committee membership, that this matter was not able to be considered within the time frame to enable disallowance of the proscription of the terrorist organisations named in the report. But it is clear that these are the most seminal terrorist organisations that might be considered for listing and it is important, I think, to focus on the fact that we are dealing with the generic names al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah, which have been the most significant terrorist organisations with potential links that can impact on Australians and have in fact taken the lives of numbers of Australians. So it was important, given the nature of the listing process, that the committee examine the evidence and it is important that the Australian public recognise from the evidence that has been adduced that these organisations still continue to pose significant threats to Australians, not necessarily in Australia but they can undertake actions and have undertaken actions which lead to the loss of Australian lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we have before us is a review of the initial listing of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the relisting of al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah, al-Qaeda in the lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Jamaat Ansar and Abu Sayyaf group and al-Qaeda in Iraq. I certainly believe very strongly, on the basis of the evidence that was adduced to the committee but also on an enormous amount of publicly available information, that we should continue. Mention was made of Jane's. If you read the report you will find that material is there and one ought to be very conscious of it. When I looked at the material in relation to the new organisation that is being proscribed, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the committee's view is that this organisation is one that should be proscribed. We were not minded to see it disallowed even if the time frame permitted of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Outlined in the report is the engagement of this organisation in terrorism, but I think it is important to look at the linkages with Australia mentioned on page 13 of the report. In paragraph 2.16 of the statement of reasons it does say that in February 2011 it was claimed in ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Correspondent</span> television program that Yemen is al-Qaeda's new frontier and a launching pad for jihad inspired terrorism and that the leader of AQAP is drawing recruits from many nations around the world, including Australia. If you look at the report of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, at a private hearing we have ASIO asserting that this organisation released four editions of its quarterly English magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Inspire</span> aimed at radicalising and mobilising Muslim youth in the West and Australia has been mentioned twice in the second edition, once as a suitable country for attacks. So I think it is important to recognise that these organisations, al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah, still pose threats to Australia. This is outlined in the report in detail. For those who have doubts and think that the situation has moved on and we should perhaps be easing off, this report should be compelling reading for all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I endorse the comments of the chair in relation to the committee and can I add in relation to the named staff in the report Robert Little, who is here in the gallery, how much we appreciate the work that he and his colleagues have done. I might say this report is very important in bipartisan terms.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr DANBY:</span>
                    </a>  The review is the first conducted by the committee since 2001-02 and is very timely given the transformations taking place across the world and our region, particularly the rise of China and India as economic powers and to some extent military powers in our region, the economic turmoil in the United States and Europe and the uprisings in the Middle East which just this morning have led to the demise of the odious Gaddafi regime in Libya with the fleeing of the said gentleman. These are challenges that confront our political and national security and strategic policy interests. The review is structured around the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's three suggested outcomes but contains an additional chapter on other issues raised during the inquiry. I must say it is probably a good idea, in my view, that the committee look at the department's report on a more regular basis. The first outcome suggested by the department focuses on the advancement of Australia's international strategic, security and economic interests. This includes matters such as Australia's representation overseas, the department of foreign affairs' human rights activities and dialogues and the department's public diplomacy activity. While Australia maintains an extensive network of diplomatic posts, the committee found that there is a substantial question in relation to the adequacy of the services it provides overseas on behalf of Australia. The committee is of the view that a substantial inquiry needs to be undertaken on Australia's representation overseas so that comprehensive advice can be provided to the government on how Australia's interests might be better served by Australia's diplomats. Currently the number of Australian embassies and missions overseas totals 89. This is far below comparable countries in the OECD, which average 150. Of the 30 developed nations in the OECD, Australia has fewer missions than all but four.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the department of foreign affairs' human rights dialogues, the committee notes the role played in facilitating bilateral human rights dialogues with China, Vietnam and Iran—the one with Iran is now defunct—and looks forward to developing these dialogues, particularly with the ongoing involvement of Australian parliamentarians and oversight by this House. It is worth noting that the committee has recently received a reference from the minister to conduct an inquiry into Australia's human rights dialogues with Vietnam and China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of public diplomacy the committee considers that the department of foreign affairs needs to make stronger efforts to capitalise on the potential offered by modern communications technology in the dissemination and collection of information. Greater effort is needed by DFAT to understand current and future e-diplomacy opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second outcome recommended by the department involves protection of Australians abroad and the provision of passport services. The committee found that the department of foreign affairs provides valuable advice to Australians travelling overseas; however, our efforts need to be directed towards increasing the proportion of Australians using Smartraveller. Furthermore, while travel advisories have always been contentious, liability issues associated with understanding the level of risk means it is wise to take a cautious approach in issuing travel advisories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third outcome details the department's efforts towards providing for a secure Australian government presence overseas via the provision of security services and the management of Australia's overseas owned estate. The committee is satisfied with the department's efforts in this area but cautions that the department of foreign affairs needs to maintain security of its e-network in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two other issues arose during the review: gender equality within the department and staffing implications of DFAT's funding. The committee noted the considerable gender disparity at the senior executive level, but the department made the point that very high proportions of graduate intakes are female. The committee is satisfied with the response to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a long-term relative decline in the funding of the department. This has resulted in staff cutbacks experienced by the department under successive governments. Consequently, Australia has fewer diplomatic posts, as I said earlier, compared to comparable OECD countries. The committee is pleased to note, however, the recent increase in DFAT's funding. This trend should be continued and the number of overseas posts increased. I note the Lowy report was in the newspapers today. It makes a number of other suggestions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />I thank the committee secretariat—Dr Carter, James Bunce, Rhys Merrett, Jessica Butler and Sonya Gaspar—for all their great work. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I join the member for Melbourne Ports in providing some comment on the recent review of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade annual report 2009-10 by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I join him in thanking the secretariat for the wonderful work they have done. The chair of this committee has been far too generous of the state of the current Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the austere stewardship of the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Griffith. The department is becoming increasingly focused on Australia's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council to the detriment of so many other areas that it needs to focus on. One of those important areas is our relationship with Indonesia. The live trade debacle was a complete and utter fiasco, attributed in part to a DFAT that, unfortunately, has been utterly put to task by the foreign minister on a range of other matters. I am sure Australia's beef producers will be interested to hear that the foreign minister is far more interested in getting a spot for two years on the UN Security Council than he is in representing the interests of thousands of Australian families in the north of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our relationships with our neighbours, such as PNG and Fiji, remain important but again are being left to deteriorate because of the foreign minister's unwavering and unexplainable obsession with getting Australia a two-year seat on the UN Security Council. His actions, frankly, are jeopardising Australia's place within the region and the world, not to put too fine a point on it. The shadow foreign affairs spokesperson, Julie Bishop, stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the absence of a credible explanation, one can only assume it is an ego-driven campaign to satisfy Kevin Rudd's vanity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sentiments have been backed up by the recently released Lowy Institute report that is, frankly, damning of DFAT and its minister. The report speaks of a broken department and a grossly inadequate diplomatic footprint with too few international posts and too many bureaucrats in Canberra. Indeed, the report states that Australia has about 89 embassies and consulates compared to the OECD average of over 150. In the light of such numbers the report puts up one can only assume that Lowy has got it right—that it is grossly and utterly inadequate. Morocco has an embassy in Australia, yet our footprint in Africa is slight, to say the very least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report notes that there is exceptionally low foreign language capability. Less than a quarter of DFAT staff speak a second language and less than 10 per cent speak an Asian language. Minister Rudd's obsession with obtaining a place on the UN Security Council is debilitating an already overstretched department, which is failing to meet even basic demands. That is what the Lowy Institute report states. Despite some improvements at the margins, DFAT still faces serious shortfalls. The Lowy report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unless these deficiencies are remedied, our economic, political and security interests could be seriously jeopardised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are frightening words from an independent report looking at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the stewardship of this Labor government. I repeat, the report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unless these deficiencies are remedied, our economic, political and security interests could be seriously jeopardised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With 747 Kev flying around the world at twice the rate of any commensurable minister in the history of our nation, we still have an independent report saying that our interests could be seriously jeopardised. The report continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For a highly globalised country facing a more challenging external environment, Australia's diplomatic footprint remains too limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />I am sure Prime Minister Gillard is more than happy for Foreign Minister Rudd to be travelling around the world and, frankly, not in Australia. It takes more than just flying in and flying out, Foreign Minister Rudd, to maintain close relationships with other nation states. The Lowy Institute poll goes on to say the real opportunity far exceeds the $23 million cost. I commend the report to the House. I ask the government to correct the deficiencies before it is too late. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVY" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms SAFFIN:</span>
                    </a>  It gives me great pleasure to present the committee's report for this parliament. Through a lengthy and informative inquiry, members of the Trade Subcommittee explored how we can improve Australia's trade and investment relations with the countries of Asia, the Pacific and the Americas. Trade is important to economic health and critical to the development of bilateral and multilateral relationships between countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the eve of going to print with our report, the Minister for Trade, the Hon. Craig Emerson MP, informed the subcommittee that he would soon publish the government's trade policy statement. We agreed to wait for the statement and then took evidence on it. This has been incorporated into our report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we commenced the inquiry, little did we know that the global financial crisis was breathing down our neck and it came to besiege our nation and most of our trading partners. How Australia weathered the financial crisis is the envy of the world, in particular those with developed economies. Australia's economy is strong and is ranked 12th within the OECD for GDP purchasing power parity. Closer to home, most people seem surprised, when the miracle of Singapore is touted, to discover that the New South Wales economy is significantly larger than Singapore's.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global financial crisis caused some alarm that commitment to open trade would dissolve, and in some cases it did. Surprisingly, though, the general commitment to open trade held largely in order to complete the Doha round of negotiations. Agricultural trade remains the most contentious issue not only for developing countries but for developed economies as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trading figures for Australia are healthy and on the rise. The Australian dollar is currently trading at an all-time high against other major trading currencies. This generally has the effect of making Australian exports less competitive as the purchasing power of foreign currencies is reduced. Despite this, healthy export revenues are contributing to trade surpluses through strong market prices and demand for Australian resources. Conversely, a strong Australian dollar sees imported products becoming more competitively priced for Australian consumers, leading to increased consumption. Both of these strengths are reflected in the current health of Australia's economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry, the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement was signed off in February 2009, which was greeted enthusiastically particularly by business. The Productivity Commission also released its report on bilateral free trade agreements. Both of these were the subject of much attention during the inquiry. The Productivity Commission's report noted, however, that there is little evidence to date to suggest that Australia's six free trade agreements have produced substantial commercial benefits. The Productivity Commission's report also found that where trade had increased it was due to trade diversion rather than trade creation. Trade facilitation features large in our report, as it did for all who gave evidence to the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report makes a number of recommendations focused on trade facilitation, including that Australia continue to strongly support the work in APEC on the identification and elimination of chokepoints in regional supply chains and the development of modern and efficient communication networks. The report recommends Australia work towards a complete introduction of paperless trading as soon as possible and encourage and, where necessary, assist its trading partners to achieve the same outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also recommends that Australia should strongly encourage the complete acceptance of the APEC business travel card by the remaining members of APEC, and also explore the possibility of establishing a similar arrangement with other trading partners. It recommends COAG make improved cooperation between the Commonwealth and states, and between the states themselves, a high priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To achieve higher levels of efficiency in the transport and logistics supply chains, the report recommends the provision of infrastructure and trade facilitation. I note there was some movement on transport at the COAG meeting on the weekend. I note that because I prepared my contribution before that took place. The report also made several recommendations focused on boosting trade with Latin America, including improvements to visa application, skills recognition, working holiday programs and increased bilateral visits with countries in the region. Australian jobs depend in a large part on reciprocal trade and it is so for both city and country alike. This often gets lost in partisan political debate. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="YT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  It is with great pleasure that I follow the Chair of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the member for Page, on this very important inquiry into and report on Australia's trade and investment relations with Asia, the Pacific and Latin America. This inquiry commenced in the last parliament. That is not a reflection of the difficulties we had getting evidence; it is just that it is a very large region we were inquiring into. It included the Pacific Rim, North and South America and the Asian area including Russia, which was of interest. I think many people out there may not realise the important role that Russia and Latin America play in APEC discussions. I think that if you look at the three regions—Asia, the Pacific Rim and Latin America—geographically they are so close to Australia and very important to our trading relations in the years ahead. Whilst we may have taken into the second parliament to complete this report, I commend the recommendations and this report to the many out there interested in trading in this region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the people, the embassies and high commissions and the members of the business community who made submissions to our committee. They were always so professional, and I would leave those committee hearings thinking, 'If only we could do a bit more to facilitate trade and break down some of the inherent barriers that have been there,' because there is a desperate need to ensure we continue to grow our domestic economy but that also means seeing that the economies of the countries that we trade with continue to grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those areas that I was interested in, as the recommendations in the press release suggest, was breaking down and doing a lot more work through APEC on those choke points and supply chains, because that is about efficiency of delivery. Another one was the introduction of a paperless trading system, because it came up repeatedly that the paperwork can so often bog down and delay a delivery of a commodity, on both sides of the equation. We have to do more work through APEC in that regard, and it might also mean assisting other trading partners within this region to develop those paperless systems and moving away from multiple supply lines of paper that often gets lost. In the electronic age in which we live today, this is something we should facilitate as much as possible not only here in Australia but also in our trading partners to assist those companies that may not be able to do it as quickly as we would like. Perhaps, as the recommendation suggests, we could assist those other countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area was to encourage the acceptance of an APEC business travel card. We found that mentioned by a lot of businesspeople in their submissions—that sometimes where a visa is needed we could do more to facilitate cooperation and that investment. Also, it was seen sometimes as a barrier—'Can we go now and meet with another country where there may be a business opportunity?' So I commend that also; I would like to see more work done on that through APEC to encourage the acceptance of an APEC business travel card. It sounds small, but it was one of those things that sometimes became an annoyance. There should be that facilitation for visits to build greater confidence in trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one was to work through COAG with the state governments. Quite often we found that states were doing something to facilitate trade with a particular trading partner and the Commonwealth was also trying to do it. It sends a confusing message when it is the same nation as a whole trying to facilitate trade in other countries, and we need to work through COAG to get greater cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and to avoid overlap when it comes to that work that is, at the end of the day, creating jobs in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I thank the secretariat for the wonderful work that they do. They are just tireless—Tas Luttrell, who we had for so long, and more recently other members of the departments here in Canberra. I thank them. I thank all of those who have participated, including the business community and the high commissions and embassies who have made submissions to this very important report. I commend the recommendations to the parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I wish to make a statement concerning the committee's inquiry into language learning in Indigenous communities. I am pleased to take this opportunity to update the House on the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which is inquiring into language learning in Indigenous communities. During the committee's previous inquiry into Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system, the report of which was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Doing time—time for doing</span>, language was identified as an important component of cultural connection and community building. Many people referred to language as playing a significant role in the wellbeing of Indigenous people. Aboriginal elders reiterated time and time again that their Indigenous languages keep culture alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The main aspects of the current inquiry will investigate the links between Indigenous languages and improved educational and community wellbeing; interpreting and translating services; and strategies to close the gap in Indigenous communities and end disadvantage. The committee will look into how the use of Indigenous languages, particularly in early education, can assist in improving educational and vocational outcomes where English is a second language. The Indigenous languages policies of Australian governments and the effectiveness of Indigenous language maintenance and revival will be investigated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the inquiry the committee invites submissions from interested organisations and individuals relating to the terms of reference. The committee has noted the positive response that this inquiry has generated, receiving many inquiries and submissions from all around Australia about the importance of this inquiry into language learning. In the early stages of this inquiry we were experiencing a groundswell of interest by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in protecting, maintaining and revitalising their diverse languages. In addition to submissions, the committee has developed a questionnaire that aims to find out about specific language projects in communities across Australia. It is hoped that smaller grassroots organisations will fill in the questionnaire in order to provide information to the committee. Of the 259 Indigenous languages in Australia, only 20 are now considered strong and even some of those are at risk of being lost. We have a poor track record in this country of recording, conserving and maintaining languages as part of the living heritage of Australia. Let me emphasise once again that languages contribute to culturally strong, efficient and resilient Indigenous communities. We must strive to improve the conservation and resilience of Indigenous languages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth government is maintaining support for Indigenous languages through the Maintenance of Indigenous Languages and Records program, which is administered through the Office for the Arts within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The government has committed over $9 million to the program over the next year with the aim of protecting Indigenous languages. The MILR program is providing financial assistance to 67 projects in 2010-11 for the maintenance and revival of Indigenous languages. The MILR program provides support for a range of projects, including documentation and recording of Indigenous languages and the development of language resources and language databases to assist with the development and delivery of programs through language centres. It also supports greater coordination between language organisation activities that promote Indigenous languages in wider communities and innovative projects, including multimedia and new technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this inquiry, we will investigate the effectiveness of the Commonwealth government's Indigenous languages policy in developing and delivering its objectives, at the same time looking at the relevant policies of other state and territory governments. There seems to be a belief in Australia that we are a monolingual nation and only standard Australian English can benefit a person both educationally and vocationally. That is not correct. The evidence is overwhelming to the contrary. There is evidence that highlights many benefits for people being able to speak multiple languages. This is something that Australia really needs to open itself up to in the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the inquiry, the committee aims to look at what is working in Indigenous language learning as well as innovative measures to improve English competency in communities where English is a second language. We know that English is extremely important for educational outcomes and vocational attainment, as well as financial security across the country. This is an important second aspect of the inquiry. It is significant that for many Indigenous people in remote areas English is not their first language. Recently, we had the pleasure of meeting a group from the Utopia homelands, including Velda Morton whose children speak four languages. We need to be open to change the way we view languages. The committee expects to report to the House in the first half of 2012. We look forward to hearing responses. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="EM6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr STONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  As Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I am very pleased to make some comments about this inquiry into language learning in Indigenous communities. Language is an essential component of cultural connection, intergenerational communication and cultural transmission. That is irrefutable—it is the same the world over. However, in Australia the some 250 languages that were spoken prior to colonisation are now down to about 20 and a number of those are also in danger of disappearing. They are no longer being actively and comprehensively spoken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Language is particularly important in our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures where the history is orally transmitted and there is no written culture. Unless you have Indigenous speakers from your culture who are competent in relaying the history and the language of their kinship and religion and can effectively communicate these to the next generation in that language the culture itself is under threat. It is very important that we in Australia do all we can to support the communities who still speak Indigenous languages. Some 33 per cent of Indigenous children in remote areas of Australia speak language at home. This is commendable. The problem is for a number of those children when they go to school—unfortunately, mostly intermittently—they are not being taught in a way that also makes them competent in English, the mainstream language that is needed in Australia to be able to get a job, to obtain various licences and to be independent in every sense and not exploited by others because they cannot read, write or speak English effectively. Our challenge is how to help our Indigenous speakers of language retain that language for generations to come while being taught very effectively, in English-as-a-second-language programs probably, to also be competent English language speakers and therefore have less disadvantage in the rest of their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have another group of Indigenous Australians, mostly from South East Australia, who tragically lost their language during colonisation. They wish to have the vestiges of their languages—perhaps only a number of words—preserved, researched and documented for their wellbeing and cultural understandings. They want those vestiges of language passed on to future generations. That is a very understandable and commendable objective of these Indigenous communities. This government is doing its best to reclaim parts of language that are in danger of being lost or are now confined to only a few very elderly speakers. This is the other important part of our inquiry, how to retain languages which are in danger of being lost to future generations for all time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already taken evidence about the development of a Creole, a hybrid Indigenous English language which is not a disadvantaged language or a language that should be denigrated in any way. It is a language that has evolved through the colonisation of Australia and is widely spoken in northern parts. That language also needs to be understood and have its proper place in communication. It should be learned by those who offer Indigenous services or perhaps work in courts or other sectors that require close interaction with Indigenous communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very important inquiry, I believe. It is about maintaining the rich cultural heritage of all Australians, in particular the First Australians, the original owners of the country. It shows an understanding and acknowledgement that language is a critical and essential component of your cultural connection: knowing who you are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that a lot of our Indigenous Australians were separated by the stolen children policies over a number of generations, their language, in particular, becomes especially important to them. Often in the early schools in the colonial days, speaking Indigenous language was forbidden; children were punished and their parents were punished if they interacted in their home language. This is to be regretted, so it is time now to try to make sure Indigenous languages are kept and prosper in cultural connection, and also that these same speakers can speak English so they can fully and comprehensively participate in our communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has therefore undertaken the first examination of the performance of the Australian Federal Police in 2009-10, and has found that the AFP has fulfilled all its reporting requirements. As is noted by the AFP commissioner, Tony Negus, in the AFP's first appearance before the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… this is a significant milestone in the oversight of the AFP.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AFP is the primary law enforcement agency through which the Australian government enforces Commonwealth laws. As Australia's national police force the AFP provides a range of investigation and operational support, security risk management, security vetting and information services to assist the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature of the AFP and what is required of it has changed significantly recently, and a greater focus is now cast on national and international operations. The AFP largely met its agreed performance indicators, with one exception: the Drug Harm Index. This is a measurement of the cost avoided by drug harm due to seizures and interdictions, and they achieved a result of $473 million. This actually fell short of the domestic target for the Drug Harm Index, which was $886 million. The committee heard that the Drug Harm Index is a complex measurement that has been developed with the University of Queensland as an innovative way to estimate the social harms around narcotics and in the broader return to the community as a result of investment in law enforcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it can be unduly influenced by a large number of seizures. The report notes that in 2010:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While total seizures of drugs by Federal agencies rose significantly during the reporting period, the total weight of drugs seized was lower than in previous years …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AFP advised the committee that in response to that it launched an operation called 'Operation Novo'. This targeted parcel post, where people were mailing large volumes of small amounts of drugs through the post. As a result, 25 people were arrested in Australia and a number of others in South America. The AFP conducted a public campaign to prevent this type of drug importation, effectively: if you send drugs to Australia through the mail in small amounts you will be caught.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2011 the ANAO presented a performance audit report into the AFP to parliament, <span style="font-style:italic;">Management of the implementation of new policy initiatives</span>. This examined the AFP's management and implementation of new policy initiatives through which the AFP has grown substantially over the last decade. Whilst the AFP's performance and effectiveness remained high during this growth period, the ANAO identified a need for the agency to improve its implementation of new policies. It made four recommendations relating to internal governance, risk management, organisational capability and the oversight of new policy implementation. The AFP has endorsed all of these recommendations, and the committee looks forward to that implementation over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the limited time I have can I just indicate that in February 2010 the AFP also opened the Australian Illicit Drug Data Centre, which analyses and helps to build a picture of drug distribution across Australia. It incorporates a number of existing functions within the AFP and two new projects which are funded through the proceeds of crime. The first of these is Profiling Australia's Drug Capacity, to develop a scientific basis for monitoring geographic regions, production methods and precursor use of supply of drugs in Australia. The second is the formal risk management methodologies for precursor chemicals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be very proud of the Australian Federal Police. The committee applauds their engagement with us and looks forward to a very positive relationship in the future.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAYES:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—the committee has a duty to examine each annual report of the Australian Crime Commission and to report to the parliament on any matters appearing in or arising out of it. The committee has therefore examined the Australian Crime Commission's account of its performance in 2009-2010 and has found that the ACC has fulfilled all its reporting requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">2009-2010 was a landmark year for the Australian Crime Commission after a period of significant change. The CEO, Mr John Lawler, described the agency as continuing to define a valuable role, adding value to the work of partner agencies in their pursuit of serious and organised crime. The Australian Crime Commission continues to unite the fight against serious and organised crime, operating as a conduit and a point of fusion for criminal intelligence across the country. In this respect, the committee was pleased to hear that the newly established criminal intelligence fusion capability has already identified 53 previously unknown serious and organised crime targets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACC largely met its agreed performance indicators; however, only 67 per cent of partner agencies strongly agreed that their understanding of the overall criminal environment has increased as a result of the ACC's intelligence. The ACC has expressed its intention to improve upon this result and noted that the key performance indicators have since been adjusted to refer to the understanding of the serious and organised criminal environment to better reflect the ACC's intelligence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A major issue that arose during the examination of the annual report was the authorisation process around controlled operations. The Commonwealth Ombudsman raised concerns in the report last year in the course of the annual briefing with the committee regarding the extension of controlled operations beyond the three months in a way that may have bypassed the Administrative Appeals Tribunal oversight mechanism established by legislation. The committee used the opportunity to consult with both the ACC and the Ombudsman regarding this issue and has made recommendations that would clarify the application of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's oversight in cases where controlled operations undergo significant change in addition to an extension of time. The committee is aware, however, that the effectiveness of controlled operations may require flexibility in the face of evolving case circumstances. Given the level of complexity and the global reach of criminal enterprise, a further review of the controlled operations regime may be appropriate to ensure that it remains an effective tool in the fight against serious and organised crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also provided details of three special intelligence operations which focused on the gathering of intelligence around particular criminal activity in 2009-10. These included intelligence operations into the illicit firearms market in New South Wales, amphetamine type stimulants and new synthetic drugs, and national Indigenous violence and child abuse. In addition, five special investigations designed to disrupt and deter criminal groups through the collection of evidence and intelligence took place in 2009-10. These investigations broadly related to high-risk crime groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just by way of indicating the success of the Australian Crime Commission over the 2009-10 period, 102 people were charged, 96 convictions were achieved, $630,000 of proceeds of crime were restrained, $2.53 million of proceeds of crime were forfeited, approximately $10 million in tax was recovered or tax assessments issued, $13.7 million in cash was seized, and $74 million worth of illicit drugs was seized and therefore did not get to the markets within our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee can I say that we recognise this was a most successful year for Australia's premier criminal intelligence agency. I also pay regard to the secretariat, Dr Jon Bell and Bill Bannear, and thank them for their assistance, which is invaluable. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  The Greens are committed to getting a better deal for customers, including small business, from Australia's banking sector. That is why we have been pushing hard for a strong commitment from this parliament for banking reform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A sustainable banking and financial sector means ensuring a proper balance between effective banking and financial services for consumers and business, and fair rates of return to both the banks and the taxpayers. Up until now the balance has been wrong. Despite the global financial problems, Australia's banking sector is robust and the big four banks have been making record, excessive profits. We have one of the highest concentrations of bank ownership in the developed world, and Australian consumers are paying a premium as a result. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Improved bank competition is a key means of getting that balance right, as is proper regulation and tax regimes for the banking sector. That is why the Greens have moved to abolish $2 ATM fees; that is why we have proposed improved tax arrangements to properly reflect the taxpayers' effective subsidy of stability in the banking sector; that is why we have moved to protect smaller institutions from being swallowed up by the big four; and it is why we pushed hard to abolish mortgage exit fees over a number of years—a policy the government has since adopted. It is also why we have campaigned for account portability, the centrepiece of the bill that I will introduce today, because only when we rein in the banks' desire and ability to unreasonably boost profits at the expense of customers will we get the balance right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we saw the big four banks exposed to real competition from the rest of the banking sector we would see fees and charges go down, returns on deposits improved and better services delivered. But the focus needs to be on consumers. Banking is, in today's society, an essential service: one cannot but have a bank account. One's wages or one's allowances, if one is receiving transfer payments, get paid into electronic bank accounts. That is an enormous pool of money that is there available for the banks, and the banks should not be able to use what is in effect a licence to print money as a way of unreasonably and unfairly gouging consumers by charging excessive fees. That is why getting rid of exit fees is so important and why other barriers, such as refunding lenders' mortgage insurance, have to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report of the Fraser review, <span style="font-style:italic;">Banking services: cost-effective switching arrangements</span>, released by the government yesterday, supports our view that we need reform to enable improved account portability and lender mortgage insurance arrangements. I welcome the government's support for these reforms and I indicate that the Greens are open to a discussion on how to progress them. As a starting point, this bill will address these aspects of competition and will also provide encouragement to customers to look around for a better deal before rolling over long-term deposits. Ultimately, we would like to see Australia shift to full account portability, with an account number that customers can take with them from bank to bank in the same way that mobile numbers can move. This must be the ultimate reform goal in this area, and we believe the Treasurer and the government should commit to making this a reality. The Greens will continue to advocate for a portable account number. However, we accept, as does the Fraser review, that such a goal is hard to achieve in the short term. In the meantime, there is no reason why a lesser but significant form of account portability cannot be put in place, and that is what my bill will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make four important improvements to the banking sector designed to get a better deal for consumers. Firstly, it will allow consumers to switch bank accounts more easily. It does this by amending the Banking Act to require banks to offer switching services for new customers. Upon signing with a new bank, consumers will be entitled to advise that bank to switch over all direct debits and credits from existing transaction accounts in their old bank, or banks, for 13 months. The bill will oblige the old banks to provide all the information necessary for the new bank to enable the switch. These provisions will allow switching between bank accounts to occur cleanly and without the hassle that is currently the case. The onus will be on the new bank to do what is currently the burden of consumers, thus removing what has traditionally been one of the greatest barriers to account switching and improving competition in the sector as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anecdotally, it has certainly been my experience with the small businesses that I have spoken to in my electorate that it is small businesses who suffer the most when customers change over. Often consumers or customers will forget to reroute their direct debits, and a small business that does not necessarily have the capability to follow up will find that a direct debit they have previously enjoyed has been switched off, usually through oversight by the customer rather than through deliberate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this bill will provide consumers with more transparent information regarding their term deposits. It does this by amending the Banking Act to require a customer's bank to give written notice of the interest rate and the term that will apply if the money in the term deposit is automatically reinvested at the end of the current term. It also requires the bank to outline all special term interest rates and other special offers available from the bank at that time. This is an important principle of transparency which will prompt consumers into checking that they are indeed getting best value for money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, this bill will provide consumers with more transparent information about their rights under credit contracts. It does this by amending the National Credit Code to require any credit contract to expressly advise the debtor of any unjust transactions and unconscionable interest in other charges, as well as their rights in relation to those charges and the contract. This is another important principle of transparency which will empower consumers to enter into loans having their rights clearly spelled out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill requires lenders mortgage insurance contracts to be terminated when the mortgage itself is terminated, and for a fair proportion of any rebates paid to be returned to the debtor upon termination. It does this by amending the National Credit Code to require the mortgage lender to return an actuarially fair proportion of the lenders mortgage insurance to the debtor and, in turn, to recover that amount from the provider of the lenders mortgage insurance. Lenders mortgage insurance can be a substantial and little understood burden for consumers and as such is often a secondary consideration to the terms of the mortgage itself when consumers decide whether or not to terminate or switch their mortgages. The provisions of this bill will allow consumers to have returned to them a fair proportion of lenders mortgage insurance, which will again have the upshot of removing barriers to switching and considerably removing competition in the mortgage market.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BANDT:</span>
                    </a>  Despite the interjections that are coming from the opposition, I am pleased to say that these four initiatives offering a better deal for consumers have already been given indicative support by government and opposition MPs alike. The Senate Economics References Committee, in the opposition's majority report, conducted an extensive inquiry into competition within the Australian banking sector in 2010-11 and presented its report presented in May of this year. The four initiatives contained in this bill are entirely consistent with the recommendation of those four coalition senators, two Labor senators and Senator Xenophon. I now look forward to their colleagues in this House not only embracing the concepts recommended by their party colleagues in the other place but also having the will to implement them quickly and fully in legislation in the interests of getting a better deal for their constituents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made some progress in the two years since the Greens first proposed to remove mortgage exit fees and scrap $2 ATM fees. The government has agreed to the exit fee ban and established a review of what can be done with ATM fees. We await the results of that review and hope and expect that it includes the removal of fees for on-screen balance inquiries as well. The Fraser review has now reported and makes a strong case for the bill I have put before the House today. I am hopeful that the government's acceptance of the Fraser review recommendations and this bill can form the basis of a discussion between the Greens, the government and others in this parliament on putting in place these important reforms. We will also continue to push for a commitment from this government to move to a system of portable account numbers in the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, it seems the government is not ready to do what is needed for lenders mortgage insurance. More information in this area is not enough, so we will be pursuing the measures outlined in this bill. Again, we are yet to hear where the government stands on term deposits and ensuring that customers are able to get the best deal when rolling over deposits at the end of the term. There is still much work to be done when it comes to banking reform. We are committed to reining in the excessive profits of the big banks, improving competition and getting a better deal for customers and small businesses. That is what this bill does and it is what we continue to work for. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  This Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2011 will establish the Parliamentary Budget Office. The need to establish the Parliamentary Budget Office has been unanimously agreed by all members of parliament. The coalition went to the 2010 federal election with a policy to establish the PBO. The establishment of the PBO was a key element in the agreements that the Gillard government formed with the member for Lyne, the member for New England, the member for Denison and the Greens. The government committed to establishing the PBO as part of the Agreement for a Better Parliament: Parliamentary Reform, which was the agreement negotiated between the coalition, the Labor Party and Independents at the commencement of the 43rd Parliament of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding for a PBO has already been provided, with the 2011-12 budget allocating funding over four years. Despite the agreement that the PBO is needed and the allocation of funding commencing on 1 July this year, the government has not yet introduced the enabling legislation, so this coalition bill expedites the process of establishing the PBO. The Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2011 will establish the PBO with the following features. It will be a new body accountable to the parliament rather than the executive, much like the Auditor-General or the Commonwealth Ombudsman. It will be independent to enhance the transparency and accountability of the budget process and help deliver better policy and financial outcomes for Australian taxpayers. It will be well resourced to ensure that it is effective. It will be headed by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who will be appointed by the Presiding Officers of the Parliament on the advice of a committee of senior government officials. He or she will oversee an office of highly trained staff whose calibre will reflect the office's status as an independent body. It will be tasked with providing objective and impartial advice and analysis across the parliament on the Commonwealth budget and budget cycle, including the impact of major policy announcements. It will provide a confidential costing service for policies for all MPs and senators, both during and outside election periods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBO established under this bill will differ in a number of ways from the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office. The PBO will provide a service to confidentially cost policies submitted by members and senators all year round. This overlaps with and goes beyond the costing service provided under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, which provides for the public costing of policies only for the government and the opposition, not for the Independents or minor parties, and only during elections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint select committee envisaged the services to cost policies provided by the PBO and under the Charter of Budget Honesty would run in parallel. This is unnecessary and wasteful duplication. The costing service provided to the opposition under the charter would effectively become redundant. A separate amendment to the Charter of Budget Honesty will delete the right of the opposition to submit policies for costing under the charter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further issue is the process by which the PBO will obtain information from government departments and agencies. The report of the joint select committee envisaged that there would need to be memoranda of understanding negotiated between the PBO and the Department of the Treasury and the department of finance. This bill removes the need for those MOUs by providing the PBO with distinct powers to obtain information from government departments and agencies. These powers are based on those of the Auditor-General, although the powers do not include search powers or the power to require information to be provided by other than public service agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also removes the need for the PBO to use the freedom of information processes, as the PBO has the power it needs to request and receive information from government departments and agencies as required. In saying this, there are restrictions on the power of the PBO to gather and publish information. The PBO will not be able to request and publish information that is cabinet-in-confidence. Also information cannot be published that would be contrary to the public interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With great power comes great responsibility. The substantial powers of the PBO to obtain information will be balanced with substantial provisions to prevent the inappropriate disclosure of information. Costings of policies submitted by MPs and senators and material gathered to perform these costings are to remain confidential unless express approval for public release is provided by the relevant MPs and senators. Breaches of the confidentiality provisions by staff of the PBO will carry heavy penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The confidentiality provisions are an important feature of the PBO. They enable MPs and senators to enter into a private discourse with the PBO about the costs of policies. The costs of policies can then be released by the MPs and senators at their discretion and only after they are satisfied with the veracity of the costing. This prevents a situation which can arise under the existing costing parameters of the Charter of Budget Honesty, where costings of election policies are immediately made public by the departments of Treasury and finance without the opposition having the right of discourse or challenge.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBO will be adequately funded. The joint select committee recommended annual funding of no less than $6 million. The 2011-12 budget provided $24.9 million over the forward estimates. In an era of tight budgets and fiscal rectitude it seems inappropriate to guarantee any government department or agency a minimum fixed funding entitlement. This bill links the funding for the PBO to that provided for the Department of the Treasury, with funding set at a minimum of 3.5 per cent of the departmental appropriation for Treasury. That means that the PBO would benefit from greater funding should the functions of the Treasury be expanded but would also have to tighten its belt in times of fiscal restraint. That is appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In drafting this bill the coalition has also taken the time to consider the commitment provided under the parliamentary agreement that the PBO be located within Parliament House. However, under this bill the PBO will be an independent authority, so it will not be mandatory that the PBO be located in the Parliamentary Library.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commitment to establish a strong, independent and well-resourced PBO has been a longstanding policy of the coalition. It is a key element of the agreement which underpins the new parliament. It is a commitment shared by the government, the opposition, the Independents and the Greens. The establishment of the PBO will improve scrutiny of the budget process and enhance the veracity of policies put forward by all MPs and senators. It is an important reform that builds on the Charter of Budget Honesty introduced by the former member for Higgins, Peter Costello. It ensures accountability and transparency in the management of our country's finances. On this basis, it is disappointing the government has not yet introduced the legislation. This bill will expedite the fulfilment of this important initiative, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOCKEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  This is an amendment to the Charter of Budget Honesty Act to remove clauses which provide for the costing of election commitments for the federal opposition. These provisions will become redundant following the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will briefly review the background of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998. This groundbreaking economic reform was introduced by the Howard coalition government. Its introduction was intended to prevent a repeat of the fiscal misrepresentation of the Keating government during the 1996 election campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the campaign the then government claimed the budget would be in deficit by only $590 million in 1996-97 and it claimed it would be in surplus by $2.7 billion in 1997-98. After winning the election, the new coalition government found out the claimed deficit of $590 million was actually a forecast deficit of $7.6 billion. It also found the claimed surplus of $2.7 billion in 1997 was actually forecast to be a deficit of $7.3 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Treasurer Peter Costello proposed legislation now known as the Charter of Budget Honesty Act to prevent future governments going to an election with misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. The charter provides for the publication of regular updates to the state of the nation's finances as a complement to the annual budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these is an update on the state of the budget prior to elections. It must be released within 10 days of the issue of the writs for a general election. This update known as PEFO—Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook—is prepared by the departments of Treasury and finance. It is not prepared by the government of the day. This prevents any political massaging of the figures and ensures integrity in the reporting of the financial position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another requirement is for the Treasurer to publicly release and table a Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook report, which we know as MYEFO, by the end of January in each year or within six months after the last budget, whichever is the later. This provides updated information to allow the assessment of the government's fiscal performance against the fiscal strategy set out in the budget. We will have more to say about that in the next few days. The MYEFO updates key information contained in the most recent budget economic and fiscal outlook report and contains a detailed statement of tax expenditures, presenting disaggregated information on tax expenditures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The charter also requires the government to produce an intergenerational report every five years, and this provides an assessment of the implications of demographic change for economic growth. It also assesses the financial implications of continuing current policies and trends over the next four decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The charter also requires the government to introduce an annual fiscal strategy statement which outlines a fiscal outlook on how the government has delivered on its fiscal strategy. In addition, the charter formalises the publication of a final budget outcome to be produced annually by the government of the day and this presents final fiscal outcomes for the preceding year. It deals with the general government sector budget aggregates, Australian government financial statements, Australian government general government sector financial statements and federal financial relations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final reform of the charter was to provide for equal access for the government and the opposition to the departments of the Treasury and finance for the costing of election commitments. This was to ensure that election policies announced by both the government and the opposition were equally rigorously costed. This was intended to ensure the voting public was better informed about the financial implications of election commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The charter provides that the request for election costings can only be made during the caretaker period by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. Requests by the Leader of the Opposition for policies to be costed must be through the office of the Prime Minister, so costings of submitted policies are publicly released by the relevant secretaries as soon as practicable after receiving a request.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the charter was introduced by the coalition, in recent years some shortcomings in the election policy costing process have emerged. The charter was intended to provide potential alternative governments with equal access to departmental costing of policies during the pre-election caretaker period consistent with the principle that governments should not have privileged access to the Public Service during that caretaker period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current arrangements prevent any dialogue in confidence between the opposition submitting the costing and the department carrying out the work. This prevents the discussion of issues or the challenging of departmental views. It closes off the opportunity for further analysis or reflection by the opposition. Costings are simply published by the relevant department as soon as the work is completed. So the charter fails to provide a facility for minor parties as well, or Independents, to access the departments of Treasury or finance for policy costings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These shortcomings are addressed in my Parliamentary Budget Office Bill. The policy costing provisions in that bill provide for costings to be submitted by all non-government MPs and senators. They provide for policy costings to be submitted without the approval of the Prime Minister. They provide a policy costing service that is independent of the departments of Treasury and finance. They provide for policy costings to be confidential, with opportunity for dialogue and reassessment, which is hugely important. Costings are only made public with the permission of the relevant MP or senator. These provisions within the PBO Bill build on and improve the election costing provisions in the Charter of Budget Honesty. The passing of my PBO Bill will render superfluous the policy costing provisions in the Charter of Budget Honesty. The amendment I am introducing today will remove the redundant provisions of the charter. A related key point is that the introduction of a PBO will complement and enhance the fiscal reporting provisions of the charter through the requirement to publish regular reviews of the longer term implications for the budget of government policy decisions. This all adds to the integrity of the fiscal process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of the PBO Bill today and the related amendment to the Charter of Budget Honesty Act represent another step in the coalition's reform program to ensure integrity and transparency in government finances. The establishment of a PBO was a key element of the agreement which underpins the 43rd Parliament. Funding has commenced, yet the PBO has not. The parliament should not have to wait any longer for this important reform. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="EZ5" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ABBOTT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  This Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 is important legislation because it will, if passed, restore integrity to our democracy. It will, if passed, ensure that this fundamental principle is recognised and acted upon: that governments should have a mandate for the big changes that they seek to make. The problem which this bill seeks to address is the fact that this government, the Gillard government, has no mandate whatsoever for the biggest legislative change that it now seeks to make—namely, the introduction of a carbon tax. Not only does it not have a mandate for the carbon tax, but it has a mandate specifically not to introduce a carbon tax. This bill which I now speak to in the House is designed to give the government a chance to get back the political integrity that it forfeited by promising before the election not to introduce a carbon tax but doing precisely the opposite afterwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much time of this parliament has been taken up this year with discussion of the carbon tax. The carbon tax has dominated public debate this year. The carbon tax is by far the biggest single issue in our public life right now, and yet the carbon tax does not have the kind of democratic mandate which any government seeking to make such a change should have for a change of this magnitude. Never let us forget that six days before the last election the Prime Minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was not a statement which just slipped out. It was not just something that she blurted out unthinkingly in response to a question that she had not anticipated. This statement of the Prime Minister was a deeply calculated response to the statements that I had been making consistently throughout the campaign that 'as sure as night follows day, if this government is re-elected there will be a carbon tax'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the best of my knowledge, checking the transcripts, I made that observation on at least 15 separate occasions. I was not the only one who was saying that if the government was re-elected there would be a carbon tax. Many of my frontbench colleagues were making exactly the same point. So in order to defuse this issue the Prime Minister deliberately, with foreknowledge, with absolute cold-blooded purpose, went out and said six days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' And she did not just say that. She said just before the election—it was on the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> the day before the election—'I rule out a carbon tax.' And it was not just the Prime Minister deliberately saying that she ruled out a carbon tax and that there would not be a carbon tax 'under the government I lead'. The Treasurer also, on at least two occasions, said that claims that there would be a carbon tax if the government were re-elected were 'hysterical exaggerations'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just the specific statements of the Prime Minister; it is not just the specific statements of the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister; it is everything else that the Prime Minister said about a carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme in the lead-up to the last election. Let us not forget this was a serious problem for the government. In the wake of the collapse of the Copenhagen conference, the government's previous policy to have an emissions trading scheme—the policy championed by the previous Prime Minister to address what he said repeatedly was not just a big issue but was nothing less than the 'greatest moral challenge of our time'—had become increasingly untenable and implausible. What happened was that the former Prime Minister was advised by the current Prime Minister and the current Deputy Prime Minister to drop it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So back in April last year the government dropped their commitment to an emissions trading scheme and said that there would be no emissions trading scheme until the rest of the world had put something similar in place. That was the position in April. During the election campaign, to get this matter completely off the agenda, at the end of the first week of the campaign the Prime Minister made a major speech where she said that the whole question of climate change would be given over not to the parliament but to a citizens assembly and that no change whatsoever would be pursued by the government until, in the words of the Prime Minister, a 'deep and lasting consensus' had been achieved. So not only did she deny that there would be a carbon tax, and not only did the Treasurer deny that there would be a carbon tax, but everything the Prime Minister said during the election campaign was designed to convey that nothing at all would happen until a 'deep and lasting consensus' had been achieved—a consensus that, she said, would be impossible if the coalition stayed with the position that we had at the election campaign and, I hasten to add, have today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an absolute principle of democracy that governments should not and must not say one thing before an election and do the opposite afterwards. Nothing could be more calculated to bring our democracy into disrepute and alienate the citizenry of Australia from their government than if governments were to establish by precedent that they could say one thing before an election and do the opposite afterwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has sometimes alluded to the example of her distinguished predecessor, the former Prime Minister John Howard, in the course of this carbon tax debate. She said that John Howard had supported a GST and that he had then said, prior to the 1986 election, that there would not be a GST and that he had, in the course of the subsequent term of parliament, changed his mind and said there would be a GST. But the fundamental difference between the current Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister is that the former Prime Minister did not run away from the Australian people; he took his change of heart to the Australian people. He changed his mind in the 1996-1998 term of parliament and took his changed position to the public in the 1998 election. That is the course of conduct that the current Prime Minister should take.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If she really believes that the carbon tax is as necessary as she claims it to be and that the arguments in favour of a carbon tax are as compelling as she says they are, she should not run away from the Australian people; she should revel in the opportunity to take this matter to the Australian people. In fact, the Prime Minister whom the current Prime Minister most resembles in all of this is not former Prime Minister John Howard but former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who before the 1993 election said that tax cuts were 'l-a-w law'; but the 'l-a-w law' turned out to be an l-i-e lie. We all know the political fate of former Prime Minister Keating—a political fate sealed by that deceptive conduct at the 1993 election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might even say that, by putting forward this private member's bill for a plebiscite on a carbon tax, I am giving the Prime Minister an opportunity to redeem herself by making an honest politician of herself; that I am giving the Prime Minister an opportunity to overcome the democratic deficit and the honesty deficit which she currently displays. I am proposing in this bill that we can have a vote on the carbon tax without an election and without, necessarily, a change of government. I am making it easier with this bill to actually have this matter put to the people. By proposing a plebiscite I am allowing this matter to go to the public for a vote, as it should, without the prospect—indeed, under current circumstances, the probability—of an election producing a change of government. I am giving the government and other members of this parliament an opportunity to restore faith with fewer adverse consequences for themselves than would otherwise be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make it absolutely crystal clear that, should this bill pass the parliament and should there be a plebiscite on the issue of a carbon tax before the end of November, I will of course accept the result—as I hope the Prime Minister would accept the result should this bill pass. Whatever differences of opinion we might have in this chamber, in the end this is a democratic parliament—this is a democratic country—and every single member of this parliament has to accept the processes of our democracy. The result of a plebiscite may not change the argument one way or another about the merits or otherwise of a carbon tax, but I tell you this: it would certainly settle the politics of this issue once and for all, and that is what we need in the face of a divisive and damaging debate which is entirely the government's fault, because, if they had not made a commitment one way before the election while doing the opposite after the election, they would not be in their current predicament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw the House's attention to a couple of features of the bill. The bill says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The question to be submitted to electors in accordance with section 5 is "Do you support the Government's plan to introduce a price on carbon to deal with climate change?"</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about as neutral question as I could possibly come up with. The actual formulation of that question was arrived at after consultation with independent members of this parliament, because I want to give independent members of this House and of the other chamber every opportunity to say yes to this bill; I do not want anyone to think that this plebiscite is some kind of stitch up, and, I think, no fair-minded observer could say that a question couched in those terms was anything other than a fair question. The other point I make about the legislation is that the plebiscite will in all other respects be conducted in the same way as a referendum would be conducted: with the usual provision for compulsory voting. It is a fair question, to let the people determine an essential point. This argument—should we or should we not have a carbon tax?—is so important that the public must have their say. It is important that the public should have their say before the government proceeds with legislation, not afterwards. That is what this bill is designed to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to decent, honest members of the government—and there is at least one of them sitting opposite now on the backbenches: there must be times when you are troubled in your souls on this whole question. How can decent, honest members of a government not feel embarrassed and ashamed of the fact that their Prime Minister said one thing before the election and is doing the complete opposite afterwards? She spoke for all of them; she was not just expressing a private view, you know. She was the leader of the Labor Party and the Prime Minister at the time, so she spoke for the member for Hunter, she spoke for the member for Werriwa and she spoke for the member for Brand. She spoke for them when she said there would be no—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Prime Minister spoke for all of these members when she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' They are all complicit in this deception, and this bill gives them a chance to come clean, to make a break with this deception and to redeem themselves with the electorate. So I urge them—as I urged the Independent members of this parliament—to consider this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ladies and gentlemen, this is a fraught time in our nation's history. We know, because Paul Howse has told us, that there is a crisis in manufacturing. We have heard of the job losses from Qantas and from OneSteel. We learned today that BlueScope, our biggest steelmaker, is ceasing exporting steel because of the difficulties that manufacturing industry now faces. This country will not be an exporter of steel because of the difficulties that manufacturing industry faces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the carbon tax is not the only difficulty that manufacturing industry faces; I know that the carbon tax has not been an instrumental factor in the decision of BlueScope announced today. But let us not forget how the carbon tax is hovering over all the decisions that manufacturers are making right now. Let us not forget that companies like BlueScope have to make decisions now for the next 40 years, and the assistance package announced as part of the carbon tax lasts for but four years. Let us not forget the statement that the chairman of BlueScope made when the carbon tax was first announced back in February, that compensation for the steel industry would be like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. Let us not forget these statements. Let us not forget the tremor of fear, anxiety and uncertainty now running through manufacturing industry generally and manufacturing workers right around our country, and let us make a bad situation better by not proceeding with this carbon tax. This is the worst possible time to proceed with what is a bad tax, based on a lie. This bill of mine is a way of ensuring that the public have their chance to have their say.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have often said, and members of this House will no doubt hear me say it again, there should be no new tax collection without an election. But this bill is an opportunity for members opposite to meet me halfway. It is an opportunity for members opposite and members on the crossbench to meet the Australian public halfway, to put this to a vote without necessarily changing the government and to put this to a vote without all of the trauma of an election. I think this is a good faith attempt by a democratic opposition to allow the government to do the right thing by the Australian people. That is why I commend this bill to the House, and I table the explanatory memorandum.</span>

It is of the A to Z that the Minister for Defence knows much about and the compromise there is that it takes four minutes to read and that is four minutes of a speech. I understand that the Leader of the House will have some grievance about the fact that he cannot move that the member be no longer heard until after that point, but I think that that is the accommodation. I agree with him that it would assist the House if motions were truncated, but on this occasion we have got this far.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fourth report of 2011, addressing referrals made May to June 2011. This report deals with four inquiries with a total estimated cost of $117.6 million. In each case, the committee recommends the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding. The report includes additional recommendations to the Department of Defence for preparing future proposals for the committee's consideration and a recommendation to develop protocols for dealing with contaminated sites on Defence properties. The new works include a fit-out of new leased premises for the Human Services portfolio in Canberra, a fit-out of new leased premises for the Australian Taxation Office in Brisbane, contamination remediation works at RAAF Base Williams at Point Cook in Victoria and a specific nutritional capability project for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Scottsdale in Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me first deal with the fit-out of the new leased premises for the Human Services portfolio. The works are needed to accommodate a large portion of the portfolio's staff currently housed in different locations around Canberra. The majority of these leases are due to expire over the next three years. This proposal will reduce the number of leases and consolidate locations in line with the corporate office accommodation strategy. The committee was informed during the inquiry that the department undertook an initial procurement process for the works between 2007 and 2010 which was unsuccessful. The department had to undertake further negotiations with the first and second ranked tenderers before achieving a suitable proposal. The committee was concerned about this process, and notes in its report that all agencies should ensure their tender processes are robust and sufficiently informed by market conditions to avoid failure. Notwithstanding these concerns, the committee is satisfied that the project has merit and should proceed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving to the second fit-out of Commonwealth leased premises, the committee considered a proposed fit-out of new premises for the Australian Taxation Office in the heart of Brisbane. This proposal will consolidate two premises currently housing ATO staff into a single building, achieve greater operational efficiencies, improve the standard of accommodation for staff and meet compulsory Commonwealth standards on its environmental impacts. The committee is satisfied that this project has merit and will achieve its outcomes of meeting Commonwealth property management guidelines, increase the department's ability to adapt to changing accommodation requirements in the future and achieve more collaborative work practices.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chapter 4 of the report deals with proposed contamination remediation works at a former fire training area at RAAF Base Williams at Point Cook in Victoria. The committee inspected this site on 26 July 2011, witnessing firsthand the need for the works. The site was used in the 1980s for firefighting training. As a result, the soil now contains approximately 950,000 litres of toxic liquid waste called dense non-aqueous phase liquid. This liquid contains over 120 chemicals. While the toxic liquid is not yet in contact with nearby Port Phillip Bay, groundwater has moved through the soil on the site, dissolving chemicals which are now discharging into the bay. The physical barrier between the toxic substance and the bay is reducing due to coastal erosion, increasing the pressing need for contamination remediation works on the site. Whilst the committee observed that Defence continues to monitor the site and undertake rigorous testing, it is patently clear that remediation works are urgently needed to prevent future damage. As outlined in this report, the committee notes there are a number of other Defence sites around Australia that will require contamination remediation works in the near future. The committee recommends in its report that Defence ensure that all remediation works are of the highest standard and that contamination is removed entirely from each site. Defence must actively engage with and inform local land users, authorities and community groups, and demonstrate that each site poses no risk to human health or the environment. I move to the final proposal considered by the committee. This is the specific nutritional capability project for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Scottsdale in Tasmania. The project aims to address the shortcomings of the current facility. A cell culture laboratory will be established to enable DSTO to investigate the impact of nutrition on health and performance outcomes using modern techniques. It will present opportunities in the field of nutrigenomics and improve research and development into nutrition to meet the specific needs of the Australian Defence Force.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee inspected the current facility, which limits DSTO's ability to meet ADF directives and taskings in relation to nutrition and food science capabilities. The project is anticipated to cost $18.7 million. In reaching this proposal, DSTO considered a number of options which were brought to the committee's attention. Defence had also considered relocating the site to elsewhere in Australia; however, they did not address this option in their submissions to the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the committee is satisfied that Defence considered all options available for the project proposal, the committee recommends that each and every option considered by Defence be discussed at length in their submissions for the committee's consideration in the future. I know the locals were very pleased that it is staying exactly where it is—but that is a separate issue.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RIPOLL:</span>
                    </a>  On 7 July 2011 the House of Representatives Selection Committee referred the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The bill proposes to move the responsibility for the administration of the early release on compassionate grounds of benefits in a retirement savings account or superannuation benefits in an entity regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority from APRA to the Chief Executive of Medicare. Similarly, the general administration of the early release on compassionate grounds of superannuation benefits in a self-managed superannuation fund will be transferred from the Commissioner of Taxation to the Chief Executive of Medicare as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment formalises an arrangement that has been in place since 3 February 2011, when APRA and Medicare Australia entered into a service delivery agreement for Medicare Australia to carry out the day-to-day function of the administration of early release of superannuation in APRA regulated superannuation entities under the delegation from APRA. At the same time, the day-to-day functions of the administration of early release of superannuation in self-managed superannuation funds under delegation from the Commissioner of Taxation was transferred from APRA to Medicare Australia. There are no extra costs associated with this amendment. Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill amends the APRA Act 1998 so that the industry levy associated with the administration of the early release of superannuation benefits currently paid to APRA can be transferred to Medicare Australia to meet administrative costs. To support this arrangement, APRA officers were transferred to Medicare Australia in February of this year to undertake the administration of the early release function. The committee supports and endorses moves to formalise the interim arrangements that have been in place for over six months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After consideration of the evidence, the committee has agreed not to inquire further into this bill and recommends that the House pass the bill. I take this opportunity to echo the comments made last week by Ms Rishworth in her statement as chair of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment when responding to a referral of a similarly uncontroversial bill. While supporting the referral of bills is an effective mechanism for increasing transparency and public consultation, the committee feels that the referral process would be more effective if an explanation were also provided as to why the bill was referred in the first place so that the committee can target its efforts more effectively. The bill is simply a formalisation of arrangements that are already in place and are thus supported by the stakeholders. The committee is agreed that no further action is required by them in relation to this bill. I also take this opportunity to welcome a new committee member, Senator Thistlethwaite, and thank him for his attendance at the previous meeting.</span>

                    </a>  The bills were referred to the committee by the selection committee on 7 July 2011. At the outset, I wish to comment briefly on the decision by the House of Representatives Selection Committee to refer these bills to the Health and Ageing Committee. While the referral provided an opportunity to consider the potential health impacts of the legislation in detail, the committee is aware that much of the debate surrounding these bills relates to economic or legal issues and their impact on the tobacco industry. While these issues have been briefly noted in the report, the committee considers them to be beyond its remit. It is for this reason that commentary in this report is largely confined to the health related aspects of the proposed legislation and the impacts on health that this bill would have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 was last week referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The Senate committee has been asked to inquire into the constitutionality of the provisions of the bill. This process will provide an avenue for those who wanted more detailed consideration of this aspect of the proposed legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I am speaking today in my capacity as Chair of the Health and Ageing Committee. I have been pleased to have the opportunity to consider the health impacts of this legislation with my committee members and, clearly, the main objective of the proposed tobacco plain packaging legislation is to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco by lowering tobacco use through reducing the appeal of tobacco products and increasing the impact of the graphic health warnings on packaging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of the provisions set out in the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 will be to make it an offence to sell, supply, purchase, package or manufacture tobacco products or packaging for retail sale that are not compliant with plain packaging requirements. These offences will apply to manufacturers, packagers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers of tobacco products in Australia who fail to comply with the plain packaging requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main objectives of the accompanying trademark amendment bill is to ensure that applicants for trademark registration and registered owners of trademarks are not disadvantaged by the practical operation of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act. With a specific focus on the health related aspects of the proposed legislation, the main issue considered by the Health and Ageing Committee was whether there is sufficient evidence to indicate that tobacco plain packaging will improve health outcomes by reducing tobacco use. Overwhelmingly, public health advocates and preventative health experts expressed the view that the evidence to support plain packaging as an effective tobacco control measure is sufficiently robust to proceed. Although it is not a silver bullet, tobacco plain packaging emerged as one measure with the potential to contribute to a suite of tobacco control measures that are already in place, such as increased excise, indoor and outdoor smoking bans, increased access to nicotine replacement therapies and continued education about the harmful effects of tobacco. Over the last two decades, Australia has made significant progress in reducing tobacco use, and I quote from a recent OECD report which makes the following observation:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia provides an example of a country that has achieved remarkable progress in reducing tobacco consumption, cutting by half the percentage of adults who smoke daily …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So already, Australia has shown itself to be a world leader in tobacco control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this is not the time to become complacent. Rather, Australia should continue to innovate, to maintain momentum and to decrease tobacco use further. Reducing tobacco use would not only save many thousands from unnecessary suffering and premature death but would also lessen the social and economic burden of smoking, which is estimated to cost the nation somewhere in the region of $30 billion each year. By supporting passage of the proposed legislation, the committee believes that Australia will once again be in a position to take the lead in the implementation of progressive tobacco control measures—a role it has willingly taken in the past. And it is with a focus on the beneficial health outcomes for Australians that I conclude by providing my complete support for the proposed tobacco plain packaging legislation. I commend the committee's report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  by leave—I rise to speak on the report on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. I also congratulate the chairman of the committee who has just made his statement on the report. The report makes two recommendations. The first is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recommendation 1</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommends that the House of Representatives pass the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 is to improve health outcomes for Australians by reducing the use of and exposure to tobacco products by removing one of the last forms of tobacco advertising. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, the bill will make it an offence to sell, supply, purchase, package or manufacture tobacco products or packaging for retail sale that are not compliant with plain packaging requirements. As the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 includes restrictions on the use of trademarks on tobacco products and the retail packaging of those products, the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 was introduced on the same date to complement the main bill. In her second reading speech, the Minister for Health and Ageing explained:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill amends the Trade Marks Act to allow regulations to be made in relation to the operation of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011. The objective of any such regulations would be to ensure that the practical operation of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 does not prevent businesses from registering new trademarks, or from protecting registered trademarks against infringement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 2 was that the House of Representatives pass the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. On 7 July 2011 the House of Representatives Selection Committee referred both bills to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing for inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to introducing tobacco plain-packaging legislation the Australian government committed to consult broadly. The consultation process was administered by the Department of Health and Ageing. During the consultation DoHA met with representatives of the tobacco industry on a number of occasions to discuss issues of concern. DoHA also met with a number of retail organisations, including the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the Australian newsagents association, Master Grocers Australia, the Service Station Owners' Association, the Tobacco Station Group, the National Independent Retailers Association and the two major supermarket chains: Coles and Woolworths. There are many small businesses and business associations who felt that the consultation process was poor and that they did not have enough time or opportunity to present or submit to this inquiry or to DoHA. The outcome of the DoHA consultation was described as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There was strong support for the Bill amongst the public health and non-government organisations …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some submissions opposing the Bill claimed a perceived inadequacy of evidence to justify the plain packaging measure; a potential for detrimental impact on the tobacco industry and retailers; and the potential for the Bill to be in breach of national trade mark and intellectual property rights as well as international law obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Several submitters who did not support the introduction of plain packaging believed that there would be no health benefits at all. Some claimed that it would have unintended health consequences, leading to an increase in smoking or an increase in medical problems, due to the consumption of illegal and unregulated tobacco products. Some submitters also suggested that plain packaging would make it easier for tobacco products to be counterfeited and that increasing cigarette prices would be a more effective mechanism to reduce the smoking rate. It was also argued that plain packaging would force manufacturers to compete on price rather than brand, with the unintended consequence of reducing the price of tobacco products. The report also quotes those against the bills as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Moreover, in promoting the plain-packaging proposal, the Consultation Paper fails to look at its impact on prices of tobacco products. Price is regarded as the single-most-important determinant of smoking behaviour, with higher prices leading to substantial reductions in smoking rates. By removing the only non-price factor that brands can use to inform customers and to compete, the only remaining form of competition will be price. Lower prices have long been shown to increase smoking rates. While Australia has significant taxes on tobacco, there are still substantial price differentials between branded and generic cigarettes in Australia's market. By removing trademarks and all other brand imagery and information from the packs, price competition is expected to intensify, which would likely increase tobacco consumption, especially by youth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In sum, Australia's health justification for plain packaging is not supported by actual evidence and seems more likely to cause an increase in smoking rates, not a reduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee then went on to ask the representatives from DoHA whether the department was satisfied that sufficient evidence had been established to support plain packaging. It was informed by DoHA:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We absolutely have sufficient public health evidence to go forward with this legislation. This is as good a set of public health evidence as you get for preventative health measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition support these bills going forward, but may not always agree with the process on the consultation that was taken during the committee inquiry as well. We would like to say that we do support this and that we will not oppose these bills.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I welcome the chance to resume my remarks in relation to the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2011. At the time of the interruption of my last remarks I was speaking about the impact upon smaller colleges and enterprises in Australia today and the sometimes unintended consequences of government regulation where there is an inconsistent policy approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I have had the opportunity to do so I have been reading further papers from the Council of Private Higher Education Incorporated, which has put together a worthwhile paper in relation to this area. I would like to quote from their paper in relation to what the role of government is in the private education sector. The council says, 'The international education sector does not expect a direct subsidy of the type variously afforded industries such as manufacturing; but nor does it expect excessive charges, even under the mantra of full cost recovery. Above all, it does not expect unhelpful and unnecessary policy settings, inconsistency between different arms of government and sudden, politically-driven policy changes without full industry consultation.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amen to that. At the moment, of course, we do have inconsistent approaches between state and federal governments for this sector. We do have excessive regulation and, indeed, this government is moving us towards full cost recovery for the industry. Some people might ask, 'What's wrong with that?' Indeed in many cases I am a supporter of full cost recovery, and the fee restructuring that is going on here is not all bad. However, the inconsistency in policy approach from this government, including the handling of visas and the regulatory framework that has surrounded the treatment of international students, has meant a diminishing of this vital industry for Australia. Once again, I would endorse the role that this industry plays; it was our third biggest export industry a few years ago and totalled $17 billion in income for our country. It allows Australia to provide a great source of regional foreign policy in educating students from all across Asia. Most of those students, of course, return to the countries they come from, well educated by our country and looking forward to seeking high roles in their countries, with a high view of this country and the education services that we provide: a great outcome for all concerned. So I do think that government does have a role to provide a much more balanced regulatory framework—as the council calls for—one that is not inconsistent, one that does provide certainty for the industry and with proper industry consultation. I think that, if the government had consulted further on this legislation, it could be improved. I think that it is reasonable to say that colleges with fewer than 30 international students could benefit from a cap on the fees that are being charged. That is not something that would cost government a lot. With proper consultation I think that small and very small colleges, those struggling to survive and those that are working their way up to become large colleges, could have their fees capped. I do not think that that is unreasonable. With minimum consultation, the government could have ascertained that that would be a good idea and approach and that we could improve the quality of this legislation. I want to say again that the government often fails to consult adequately with industry sectors and I do think that that has led to the inherent weaknesses in the legislation that we see put before us in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that if a college has less than five per cent of international enrolments this will unfairly penalise them financially. With fewer than 30 international students, or less than five per cent of enrolments, there is a very low risk here of any kind of trouble for the government and what with full cost recovery and the nature of the return for the government it certainly seems to be a strange policy setting. It probably has more to do with the nature of the government debt burden we have at the moment than anything else.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course this legislation comes out of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Stronger, simpler, smarter ESOS: supporting international students </span>review conducted by the Hon. Bruce Baird. It had many recommendations, some of which the government has adopted, some which it has not. That review had a certain point of view. I think that some of its recommendations were worth while; I think that others unfairly burden this industry. It is heavily regulated. There are providers in this sector that have continued to hold the accreditation required by state and federal governments over many, many years without incident. They have been proven to be effective providers of education at tertiary level and for other courses and therefore they do not need the same level of regulatory burden or increased regulatory burden that we might be looking to target institutions that do not have such a good record or that do have problems. That is where government does have a role to play, but we have to find ways to target our legislation at the problem we are seeking to address and not to burden unnecessarily the entire sector with increasing regulatory burdens and costs without any due return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to make that point before finishing my remarks. Here in this place we have some great providers of overseas education. Indeed, we ought to be encouraging this industry to continue to do the job that it has done so well over the last decade. Certainly, this sector is suffering, not exclusively but in part, due to government action. This kind of regulation, while it may look inherently good on the surface, will not help in general with the policy settings that the government has put in place in this sector. We should seek legislation and regulatory reform that recognises those worthwhile institutions that have been accredited for a long time and that are providing a service in this space and not causing any trouble, and remove burdens as well as increase the amount of legislation or amendments that we are passing in this place. We should also seek to make the job of independent providers easier in Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to thank those members who have spoken on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2011 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Registration Charges Consequentials) Bill 2011. As we have made clear, the Australian government is deeply committed to ensuring that those international students who choose to study in Australia receive high-quality education and training. At the same time, the government maintains the same level of commitment to also ensuring that the international education services industry remains a robust and sustainable one. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2011 and Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Registration Charges Consequentials) Bill 2011 build on recent changes to the ESOS Act through the reregistration of all providers and ensures a rigorous gateway to the industry in terms of ongoing registration and compliance activity. All international education providers are required to register on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students. Through the restructure and rebasing of the annual registration charge, the Commonwealth will be able to deliver a more direct and effective registration and supervisory regime for the international education industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tiers of the restructure charge, which are outlined in this bill, reflect the different levels of regulatory risk presented by various categories of providers across the industry—something the government sees as appropriate. For example, new providers considered to be higher risk in the first three years of their operation will pay additional amounts in those initial years of operation. Providers who have had regulatory action taken against them will also pay additional amounts. Further, there is scope through regulation to allow certain providers such as public universities, technical and further education providers, and public schools to be exempted from certain elements in the new ARC such as the annual per course component. This rebasing and restructuring of the ARC is a significant milestone for the international education services industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is moving away from a charging arrangement that treats all categories of providers—all businesses in this industry—as having the same characteristics. Instead, the new ARC will reflect the different characteristics of the main subsectors across the industry, as these are reflected in the costs of registration and compliance activity. These amendments represent the first component of the government's second-phase response to the recommendations of the Baird review, which was released on 9 March 2010. In releasing the final report, the Prime Minister in her then role as Minister for Education noted that the government supports the recommendations made by the review relating to lifting the bar on entry to the international education industry. These bills take up the challenge of this recommendation by introducing an entry-to-market charge on providers seeking their first registration in the industry. This will also ensure that this group of providers is able to receive the requisite attention in their initial period of registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the restructured ARC introduces more components than the existing arrangements, this bill will realise a fairer and more equitable distribution of the imposition of these charges across the industry. This will mean many providers across the industry will experience an overall reduction in the total amount of the ARC they pay, while the introduction of a risk based element in accordance with the recommendations of the Baird review will mean that some providers pay slightly more based on that risk assessment. In turn, those providers that present more regulatory risk will receive more regulatory attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The restructured and rebased ARC will help ensure a strong and vibrant industry where high-quality providers are able to flourish and those that present a higher regulatory effort are given the appropriate regulatory attention. This first component of the government's second-phase response to the recommendations of the Baird review will make a significant difference in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of the international education services industry in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, which calls for changes to the implementation dates of the national curriculum for non-government schools. The concept of a national curriculum dates back to the 1980s; however, the states and the territories to this day have retained control over their own curricula. Historically, the attempts to introduce a national curriculum have failed and the idea has been widely criticised. The national curriculum was, however, endorsed in the leadup to the 2007 federal election and has been managed by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of the act's drafting in 2008 it was anticipated the rollout date of the national curriculum across all schools would be 31 January 2012. This bill proposes to alter the deadline for implementation to allow for a staged approach for the non-government schools sector implementation. The first part of this bill proposes to repeal the act's current implementation date for the Australian curriculum set out in the act as the original deadline. As an alternative to the original deadline the bill proposes variable implementation dates for various phases of the Australian curriculum. The Standing Council for School, Education and Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs will determine these new time lines. Due to the phased approach being undertaken to develop the national curriculum, the extent of consultations undertaken in the development and the need for flexibility have resulted in a need for a legislative amendment as prescribed in this bill. The amendment will provide a legal framework for the non-government sector to allow for the implementation and the appropriate administration of the implementation dates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To advance on the national curriculum, all of the concerns need to be assessed to ensure that we are progressing positively with our education sector and not putting the sector in jeopardy for the sake of sticking to deadlines prescribed before all of the relevant stakeholders and representatives from government and non-government schools had a chance to be consulted as part of the development process. The national curriculum must exceed the expectations of the current state and territory curricula to be a step forward. It is an important change that needs to be carefully planned and executed to ensure we do not end up in an education bungle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is supportive of the intent of a new national curriculum. However, there are some concerns with the prescribed documentation and the possibility that the content of these documents may very well overwhelm teachers who do not have the funding or support for the training that will be required before the rollout of the national curriculum occurs. For these reasons the coalition will move two amendments. The first relates to the importance of ensuring that schools are given the support they need to successfully implement the Australian curriculum. At the moment, a nationally agreed or consistent approach across all jurisdictions does not exist. This needs to occur so that schools and their teaching staff receive the professional training required to be able to implement the Australian curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment suggests a clear representation of the non-government schools with respect to the decision-making process for the future time frames of the national curriculum. In a media release issued last week by the Independent Education Union, the federal secretary, Chris Watt, said he welcomed the amendment. Mr Watt said that it is critical that non-government schools are part of the decision-making process so that they could put forward the needs of the sector. In a direct quote, Mr Watt said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Around half of all students attend a non-government school at some stage in their life, and it is critical that these schools are a part of the national conversation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly agree with Mr Watt and believe that all non-government schools should be included in this national conversation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of McPherson there are a number of non-government schools, some of which include both primary and secondary education, including Hillcrest Christian College, King's Christian College, Marymount College, Somerset College, St Andrews Lutheran College and All Saints Anglican School. The non-government sector makes up around a third of the 33 schools within my electorate, and as their federal member I need to ensure that these non-government schools are afforded the same opportunities as their state counterparts when the national curriculum rolls out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, there is no specific representation from the non-government sector on either the standing council or its advisory officials committee, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. So far, all of the major non-government stakeholders that submitted to the inquiry into the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 agreed with the bill's measures and the staged approach to the development and implementation of the Australian curriculum. However, both the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Schools Council of Australia raised concerns about the representation of the non-government sector in the development and consultation process, and had concerns about whether or not there would be support for staff and teachers during the rollout. Other stakeholders had similar concerns. I note from the submission of the Australian Primary Principals Association that it is concerned about the lack of a properly considered and cohesive national implementation plan, along with adequate resourcing to support the curriculum's implementation and the need for appropriate consultation with relevant stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the concerns raised here today, I would like to highlight a local issue that is relevant to this debate on the implementation of the national curriculum. Many people relocate to the Gold Coast from interstate, and at present there is no direct correlation between the curricula in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. For example, a child who completed year 2 in Victoria could go into either year 2 or year 3 in Queensland. If the child transferred to the age-appropriate year 2 it is quite possible that the child will already have completed some of the curriculum interstate before transferring to Queensland. However, if the child were to transfer into year 3, that child would most likely have some gaps in their learning since there would be some of the curriculum that had not been covered and they would be a year younger than their classmates. This alone is likely to create angst for the child, their siblings, their parents and their teachers, and this certainly needs to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this weekend an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gold Coast Bulletin</span> addressed the confusion over the starting age for school children. According to the article, parent groups are now pushing for a national school starting age. A reference to this 2006 report from Access Economics and Atelier Learning Solutions was included in the article to support the push. The report claimed 80,000 children were moved between states with their families each year. The article stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a national school starting age could help children from low socio-economic families get into the education system and gain access to numeracy and literacy programs faster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in New South Wales, the primary education journey is from kindergarten through to year 6. This spans a total of seven years. The eighth year of schooling begins in year 7 at secondary school. Students are at least four years and five months of age when entering the New South Wales school system. In contrast, although children enter the Queensland system at four years and six months, they will spend eight years in primary school from prep to year 7, and move to secondary school in their ninth year of education to start year 8. In summary, Queensland students spend eight years in primary school and only five years in secondary school, while in New South Wales students spend seven years in primary and six years in secondary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland school system is scheduled to be in line with the other jurisdictions by 2015, and year 7 students will make the move to Queensland high schools. Locally, one of our largest state high schools, the Palm Beach Currumbin State High School, is in the final stages of a $9 million expansion that will include classrooms to accommodate the 20 per cent increase in students predicted from the inclusion of year 7 in their school. Whilst this is obviously a separate issue to the bill we are speaking on, it is of paramount importance to Queensland schools and particularly to those schools in my electorate which will also be facing the additional expenses and administrative duties incurred in making room for these students at all schools in both the government and non-government sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the implementation of the national curriculum is being costed and planned for, these schools may also have to juggle the expansion and transition of year 7 to the high school sector. This is just one local example of the many issues surfacing in relation to the national curriculum. It needs to be considered when planning such a significant change to the existing education sector. In 2008, the Prime Minister said the curriculum would take three years to develop and that its implementation would take place in all jurisdictions from January 2011. It is now August 2011 and there are still many concerns and issues with the national curriculum. In the current legislation, all non-government schools are required to implement the national curriculum by 31 January 2012. We are only months away from that date, so it is imperative that these changes proposed in the bill be made to the existing legislation to allow for more flexibility and more forward planning.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  We all come to this place to make a difference, to leave a mark and hope that by being here we have made a contribution to a better future—a better future for our children, communities, constituents and this country. That is why I am speaking in support of Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. This bill is part of the passion and purpose this government has to provide a better future for our nation through providing our children with quality education for the next century, an education that prepares children for a life where they have the skills to adapt to the jobs of tomorrow and the building blocks of lifelong learning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider, for example, the job of a mechanic. As one OECD official put it, 'In 1930 all the coded information for a General Motors car could be captured in 230 pages. Now a single car involves some 15,000 pages of coded knowledge which workers need to access, manage, integrate and evaluate.' As electric cars replace petrol ones and self-drive cars replace the ones we have today, the job of a mechanic is going to steadily change. That is why we need to provide learning opportunities and lifelong skills in an education system that gives all Australian children the same grounding to embark on a future that we can only imagine from its edges. The Australian curriculum is a big step towards such an educational system. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I visit schools in my electorate of Fraser I am always inspired by the passion the children have for the future and by their enthusiasm, energy, imagination and ideas. I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and passion of the teachers who nurture and support the aspirations and goals of the students. Our schools are the places that teach creativity, instil a love of learning and impart critical skills such as literacy and numeracy that form the foundations of our future productivity and prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Australian national curriculum all Australian children will be studying the same curriculum in the four key subjects of English, mathematics, science and history—key areas that will provide children with the confidence and skills they need for a great education. Developments for a national curriculum in geography, languages and the arts are also underway. As part of the curriculum reforms parents and teachers will be able to go to the Australian curriculum website and view what teachers are expected to teach and the quality of learning expected of students in the four learning areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the ACT the government and non-government schools already commenced the implementation of the curriculum this year. I am pleased to say that schools in my electorate are among the first in the country to start teaching the Australian curriculum. Most other states and territories are using this year to prepare and trial the curriculum before commencing its implementation next year. Teachers are using the time to familiarise themselves with the curriculum and to prepare their teaching programs. In Western Australia schools are trialling the curriculum with a view to commencing implementation once final adjustments are made. In both Queensland and Tasmania the schools in the government, independent and Catholic sectors will introduce the English mathematics and science curricula next year, with history to start in 2013. By amending the Schools Assistance Act 2008 the implementation of the national curriculum will be able to be undertaken by states and territories in a manner that enables government and non-government schools to coordinate this according to an agreed time frame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the National Education Agreement the states and territories have agreed to use resources for the professional support of teachers linked to the curriculum. We are providing support through the national digital resource collection managed by Education Services Australia. Schools and teachers will have access to over 5,000 resources aligned with the Australian curriculum with more to follow. The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership is to deliver professional development through its Leading Curriculum Change professional learning flagship program which aims to build the capacity of teachers to enhance implementation of the curriculum. The government also has a major schools reform agenda, a digital strategy for teachers and school leaders, an improving teacher quality national partnership, a national partnership agreement on literacy and numeracy and a major national partnership for school reform in up to 1,500 low-socioeconomic status schools across the country. The last of these is a reform that I am particularly familiar with having been seconded to the Australian Treasury in 2008-09 to work in part on this national partnership. I would like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the dedicated Treasury officials in the Social Policy Division. These and the Australian curricula form part of the record investment of $66 billion in education over four years, investment that every parent, every teacher and every member of the school community will have seen on the ground as they visited Australian schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House take education seriously. We know that a great education is critical to raising productivity and living standards and that by boosting the quality and quantity of education we can increase innovation in the economy, provide the skills and do the jobs of the future. We are committed to this reform agenda which is based on Labor values: fairness, quality, accountability and transparency. But we have to compare this to the actions of those opposite. They want to cut $3 billion from our education system and that still does not help them with their $70 billion budget black hole. They do not have an alternative plan for education and they want to cut trade training centres. They want to reduce funding for improving teacher quality. They want to scrap online tools for parents. They are against My School 2.0, which provides an unprecedented level of transparency and information to Australia's parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without a vision for education, you do not have a vision for the nation's future. Standing in the way of the Digital Education Revolution denies thousands of children access to new technology, to the tools of the future. Without the Smarter Schools program disadvantaged students miss out on support to improve their attendance and boost their learning once they arrive at school. Without a Reward for School Improvement program we will not see schools in disadvantaged communities get the recognition and rewards from continuing to improve their school and their education.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is exactly this kind of hard work of education reform that we on this side of the House got into politics to achieve. Education is the best antipoverty vaccine that we have and provides the foundations on which Australians can build the life of their choosing. Education means that a child from Ilfracombe can become the first female member of the Queensland bar and our first female Governor-General. The Schools Assistance Amendment Bill brings Catholic independent schools in line with government schools so that all schools will have the same curriculum and the same curriculum implementation timetable. It provides certainty to non-government schools and treats all schools the same. The proposed amendment allows for a more certain legal framework for the non-government sector to implement the Australian curriculum and allow future editions and revisions of the curriculum to be made more efficiently each time it is updated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises and respects the role of the non-government schools as part of the great education system of partners in our children's and our nation's future. I have had the privilege of visiting many of these non-government schools and government schools in my own electorate and I have seen with my own eyes the education reforms that are happening there and the great contribution that the Gillard government's school agenda is making. The Australian curriculum will deliver a national standard to all Australian children in English, mathematics, science and history, and making sure that we successfully implement it is absolutely critical. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of the speech I talked about the need for our education system to prepare children for a life where they have the skills to adapt to the jobs of tomorrow and where they have the building blocks of lifelong learning. The amendment to the Schools Assistance Act 2008 is an important step towards providing greater certainty and alignment for all schools in the implementation of a national curriculum in key learning areas. The quality of our education system is our future. Studies have shown that countries with higher maths and science scores grow faster, innovate more, and have stronger economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government takes educational opportunity seriously and we take reform seriously. We want every young Australian to have the chance to fulfil their potential and to be able to meet the demands of a labour market that will change as much in the next 50 years as it has over the last 50 years. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. This bill removes the requirement that the national curriculum for the non-government schools must be implemented by 2012. The practical effects of the bill will be, in essence, to do what the coalition has been asking of the government since last November, and that is, firstly, to delay the start of the implementation of the national curriculum on the basis that it is simply not ready and, secondly, to ensure that the non-government schools can also implement the national curriculum to the same timetable as the government schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We asked for a delay last November in a motion put to this parliament by Christopher Pyne, the shadow education spokesperson, and seconded by me. We then further moved an amendment to the schools assistance bill in March to ensure that non-government schools would be able to implement the national curriculum at the same time as government schools. We moved these motions and amendments not because we wanted to be obstructionist with regard to the government's policies and plans, but simply because the national curriculum was not ready. Every single stakeholder knew this. The school principals did, the education authorities did, the teachers did, and the parents did. We could see as plain as day that the national curriculum was not ready. But of course the government did not see this and not only voted against our motion last November, but then also against our amendments in March. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth reflecting on some of the stakeholder comments back in 2010. If you look across the board, almost every single stakeholder has said that the national curriculum has serious flaws and that more time was needed for its implementation. For example, the Victorian Association of State Secondary Principals has described the national curriculum as being:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… not up to scratch, drowning in content, overlapping subjects such as science and geography and contains no agreement as to how it would be assessed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Council of Deans of Science wrote to Minister Garrett asking him to delay the implementation of the science curriculum. The President of the Science Teachers Association, Anna Davis, said there needs to be another round of consultation which includes teachers, which was not included in the first round. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mathematical Association of New South Wales claimed the maths courses proposed for years 11 and 12 were too difficult for students with learning difficulties but too easy for those who were gifted students. The History Teachers Association has also written to the minister expressing concern about the national curriculum—and I could go on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We then had the problem that the government was willing to defer the implementation for the government schools sector but not for the non-government schools sector. For many, many years under both the coalition and Labor governments we have had an implied principle that every school policy that is introduced would apply equally to the government schools and the non-government schools, be that testing, National Safe Schools Frameworks, the My School framework, school starting ages et cetera. The only area where there is not consistency between the non-government schools and the government schools is in the area of funding. So amendments earlier in the year were simply to defer the starting date for the non-government schools sector and to bring it into line with the government schools sector. But of course the Labor government voted against that one also.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it comes as somewhat of a surprise, but also a welcome surprise, that this amendment is put to the parliament now. </span>

                    </a>  They have seen the light, as the member for Longman just pointed out. This amendment does give the discretion to the government to defer the implementation of the national curriculum for as long as is required and to ensure that the implementation start date will be consistent between the non-government school sector and the government school sector. We hope on this side of the House that they will defer it until the national curriculum is ready. It is a fairly simple proposition. We just simply ask that they defer the start date until the national curriculum is ready.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national curriculum is not ready now and it may still take some time before it is ready. We suggest that the government not rush this process, that it takes its time and gets it right, unlike many other things which it rushes and gets wrong. This is a very important measure which they are trying to introduce. It has great impact across 10,000 schools across the country so we simply suggest that the government spends the time, does the work properly, consults with the appropriate groups and gets the national curriculum right before they try to introduce it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say, I have never been enamoured with the concept of a national curriculum. I have always believed that we should have national consistency in our curriculum but not necessarily that we have to have exactly the same curriculum across every single school in the country. However, if we are going to proceed down this path then we need to get it right. I still have some serious concerns with the current draft as it exists at the moment. For example, there is little by way of an overarching framework or a clear direction for the curriculum as it stands. The curriculum has a heavy—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Saturday, 20 August was the first National Bookshop Day conducted in Australia. I was very pleased to participate at Robinsons Bookshop in Victoria, the oldest continuing independent bookseller in Victoria. The booksellers and bookshop community have had to come together because, rather than having a Minister for Small Business, we seem to have a 'minister against small business'. Senator Sherry predicted the demise of bookshops. At a time when all in the retail sector are doing it tough, the last thing they needed was a knife in the back from the Gillard government minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the bookshop community thought it would not just stand back and bemoan the underperformance of the small business minister; it would get out there on the front foot to share with people that independent bookshops and booksellers do more than simply sell books. They are a great place to foster a love of reading, ensuring books are embedded in our culture. This could not be more true than for Robinsons Bookshop in Frankston in the community of Dunkley that I represent. It is right in the heart of Frankston. It is a fantastic place with a coffee shop at the back. There are dedicated staff sharing, as they did with me, their knowledge and expertise on good book purchases for loved ones, families and personal consumption. I was happy to buy another in the series of Slinky Malinki, a great children's book series.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As in so many policy areas, this government is not about abating emissions or sequestering carbon; it is about abating optimism and sequestering confidence. We need a change of government to support the retailers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  I rise to congratulate a special lady in my electorate of Bass, Jill Bell. Jill is a Launceston swim instructor who has won a national AUSTSWIM award. It is appropriate that Laurie Lawrence was in parliament today for a Do the Five promotion. Jill won the 2011 national AUSTSWIM Teacher of Infants and Preschool Aquatics award and is the first Tasmanian in six years to win a national AUSTSWIM award. Jill has over 30 years experience and was acknowledged in July for her commitment to and passion for teaching young children water safety and swimming. It was Jill who introduced infant aquatics programs to the Launceston Swim School. She is clearly passionate about teaching children to swim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AUSTSWIM described the award as being the premier award presented to individuals that achieve the highest standard of aquatics education. With so many young people enjoying water related activities during the summer, water safety and learning to swim are becoming more important than ever. Every child should know how to swim and be competent in water safety. Knowing that we have such a skilled teacher is pleasing. Every child should be a swimmer and every swimmer has the potential to be a lifesaver. Again, I congratulate Jill for her hard work over the years. I wish her all the best as she continues her teaching career. Thank you, Jill.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Last month I sent a brochure and a survey to residents of Boronia in my electorate. I received hundreds of responses to the survey. The biggest local issue that was raised concerned high-rise developments in the area of Boronia. Under the present guidelines, buildings of up to 11 metres could be built in the streets immediately surrounding shopping precincts. I have put to the Knox council that they should revert to the Boronia structure plan which was agreed in 2006. That was agreed after extensive consultation with local residents, and there was broad community support for the Boronia structure plan. The plan allowed for modest developments, not 11-metre-high buildings. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are already a large number of houses planned for the Knox area: in the Mirvac estate in the area around Knox city, in the new areas of Rowville and in medium-density housing which is underway across Knox. We do not need high-rise developments in the Boronia area, which is almost 30 kilometres from the city centre. I have also suggested that we need to ensure that our infrastructure is in place before we considerably grow our population; otherwise we will end up having a larger economy but potentially a lower quality of life. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Today I would like to recognise the valuable contribution made by Dr Peter Sharp to improving health services for the Indigenous community in the ACT and region. Peter is the medical director of the Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service, which was established in 1988 to provide a culturally safe and holistic health service for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of the ACT and the region. He is also Winnunga's longest serving staff member.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter started work at Winnunga in 1989 while working at Campbelltown Hospital. He would travel down every weekend to run the clinic and to do home visits. He also volunteered as team doctor for local junior rugby league team the Bogong Warriors. In March 2000 Dr Sharp, together with Winnunga CEO Julie Tongs, established a medical outreach program to the Belconnen Remand Centre and, in July that year, Goulburn prison. Peter now runs clinics at the Alexander Maconochie Centre, Bimberi Youth Justice Centre, Cooma and Goulburn prisons and Narrabundah Primary School. Peter also works tirelessly helping people affected by alcohol and substance abuse and trains other medical professionals in Indigenous health. Through his work with the Indigenous community, he has a great understanding of the complex health, social, emotional and cultural needs of his patients. He is well regarded.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay this tribute today because Dr Peter Sharp is battling cancer at the moment. He is now working part time at Winnunga from a wheelchair, but he is still strongly committed to providing quality health services to the community there. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Private Robert Callaghan served in the Australian Army from 11 May 1943 to 1 July 1946. He served a total of 1,148 days in the 3/14 Australian Field Ambulance. Mr Callaghan really should be congratulated for the service that he gave to our country. Unfortunately, though, he experienced some great difficulty in the last six months of his life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  This morning BlueScope announced to the stock market that it had posted a $1 billion loss and that as a consequence it would make redundant about 1,000 workers from its operations in Victoria and in New South Wales, including 800 workers who mainly reside in my electorate of Throsby in the Illawarra. In its statement to the stock market, BlueScope cited high input costs, particularly coal and iron ore, the low prices internationally for steel and the very high Australian dollar as the principal reasons for its job losses. A careful reading of the statement shows that their domestic business remains viable but their international market is under incredibly difficult circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the House would be aware that this is an incredibly difficult time for the workers who are affected, and it creates a lot of anxiety and uncertainty for the employees, contractors, their families and the entire region. I welcome the fact that the government has moved quickly to announce support in the form of a $140 million package. This includes a $30 million fund to assist in diversifying the economic base of the Illawarra, and $10 million which has been set aside for labour market adjustments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />No doubt the major driver is the high Australian dollar. We understand that this will correct in the near future but we must ensure that we have a manufacturing business in Australia when that re-correction occurs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Connie Fierravanti-Wells, shadow minister for ageing and mental health, for visiting my local community earlier this month. The senator and I went to local aged-care facilities, and we had a very honest, open and often robust discussion about the challenges facing aged care into our future. As policymakers in this place I think it is important that we rise to meet what will inevitably be a very significant challenge for our nation with the ageing of the population.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The senator and I then held yet another open forum with over 40 local service providers in the mental health area. Once again we had a very robust discussion about the challenges facing mental health service provision in my local community and across the nation. It was made evident that these challenges are roadblocks to all facets of our society, be they employment or social inclusion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The senator and I engaged in the discussion about how we meet these challenges. It was made evident that locally, with nearly twice the average rate of suicide, we need 24-hour care, we need acute and subacute care and, in short, we need an Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre. This is something that was committed to by me and the coalition at the last federal election and something which we remain committed to. It is something which I am fighting for for my local community so that we can rise and meet the significant challenges as a society. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Today I want to recognise the achievements of Darcy Ward from Camira in my electorate of Oxley. Darcy is a young man who at the tender age of just 19 years is a two-time world under-21 speedway champion. Darcy competes professionally in Europe and is mainly based in Britain. As we know, speedway is very big in Britain and in Europe but it is much loved here in Australia as well. He started his career in Britain in 2008 and since 2009 he has been competing with the premier league club Kings Lynn. He has finished the 2009 season with the highest points average in the premier league.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009 he won the league with the Kings Lynn club, and closer to home he also won the Queensland under-21 championship, the Australian under-21 championship and in October 2009 he won the world under-21 championship in Croatia as well. This is an outstanding achievement, a great track record and demonstrates once again the great talent that we have in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010 Darcy made the transition to the elite league in Britain. He helped his new team reach the end of the season play-offs where, unfortunately, they just missed out on the title. In 2010 Darcy won the New South Wales under-21 championship as well as the Australian under-21 championship. Remarkably, he also went on to defend his title and to win the world under-21 championships again. He is only the second ever rider in history to do that and retain his title. In January of this year he also won the Australian under-21 title for a third time. Darcy is a household name in the world of speedway, and he should also be one in Australia.</span>

Let us hear what the mums and dads of the Latrobe Valley are saying about their carbon tax. From Ken in Traralgon: 'You pinched the last election with your lie. Prove how popular you are: call an election.' Then we have Brian from Willung: 'An absolute disaster for Latrobe Valley for families and workers alike.'

Why won't one of you stand up and have the spine for the workers? People in my community do not want your household assistance package and they do not want your jobs transition plan; they want the decency of keeping their jobs. You would have to be an absolute mug to support the introduction of a new tax which will make Australian companies less competitive during a time of great global economic uncertainty. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I think members of the House would have received that news on Friday morning with a great sense of despair. The three were Gary Ticehurst, John Bean and Paul Lockyer. It was for the ABC one of its darkest days. All three died doing what they did so well, going out and getting the story. Between them these three men shared a century of experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary Ticehurst was one of the nation's finest helicopter pilots with 38 years in his flying career, including 25 years as the ABC's chief helicopter pilot, and was famous for his coverage of 27 Sydney to Hobart yacht races. He displayed remarkable courage helping to rescue 20 crew members in that disastrous Sydney to Hobart yacht race in 1998, and many of us would remember that well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Bean was an exceptional, multi-award-winning cameraman. Reporters always wanted to work with him. Queensland based, he knew every corner of that state and I had the opportunity with Premier Bligh on Friday to reflect on some of the things she had seen him doing in Queensland. He worked on some of the ABC's most popular programs including the <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30 Report</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Catalyst</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he New Inventors</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Gardening Australia</span>. Camera work is at the very heart of television, and images that tell the story often better than the words were his passion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul Lockyer was one of the ABC's longest serving reporters—42 years. He spent years as a foreign correspondent in the killing fields of Cambodia, in the US under Reagan and in Manila under Marcos. He was responsible for Logie award-winning coverage of the Sydney Olympics but was best known in recent years for his sympathetic portrait of inland Australia, especially the Murray-Darling Basin and Lake Eyre, and coverage of the floods in Queensland this year. He was the first into Grantham the morning after the floods, bringing those reports which enabled the nation to understand what had happened there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I spoke of journalism and media as an honourable profession. The lives of these three gifted men prove that proposition beyond a shadow of doubt. Men and women of the media so often risk their lives to bring the story home in war and conflict, travelling to inhospitable places and making personal sacrifices which include danger, discomfort and austerity. Gary, John and Paul took these risks and told their stories. They were true professionals and true gentleman of the Australian media. Leigh Sales said that you could not name three people in the ABC news more loved and admired. ABC managing director, Mark Scott, said that they were news gatherers at the peak of their craft. Our deepest condolences go to their families, to the wider ABC family and to all of their colleagues and friends. These three remarkable men will be greatly missed and our media landscape will not be the same without them.</span>

Gary Ticehurst was a pioneer in helicopter news coverage and he was also widely respected within the aviation community. John Bean was an outstanding cameraman and was able to convey to people some of the real depth of the issues through the pictures he took. He spent some time with me on what is known as the wombat trail during the last federal election campaign with the Leader of the Third Party and I can attest to the fact that he is also good company to be with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would particularly like to recognise Paul Lockyer. I thought Paul had done all of the great things that journalists do, the big stories: big events such as the Olympic games, <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Correspondent</span> and the big programs but, particularly in his latter years, he spent a lot of time telling the regional stories and spending time in regional communities. He was able to bridge the gap between country and city with warmth and conviction in the way he was able to tell the stories. For instance, during the flooding in Queensland there were hundreds of journalists and hundreds of stories, but I think the ones that touched us most were Paul Lockyer's coverage of what happened in Grantham. It was not just the gravity of the event. The way in which that story grabbed all of our hearts and minds was due to the way in which he was able to bring some of the humanity of that catastrophic event into the living rooms of Australians. He certainly was a great journalist, but I want to particularly acknowledge today the contribution that he made to regional Australia as someone who was prepared to get out into the country areas and tell the stories in a way that we all understood. His coverage of the drought also, I think, helped people very much to understand the personal tragedies associated with events like this. This team died doing something they loved in the remotest part of Australia, and perhaps the place where they would most have wanted to be. We certainly acknowledge their contribution to journalism, but today, especially, I also want to acknowledge their contribution to regional Australia.</span>

Again, not wishing to mark people's homework, in the repeated fashion the Leader of the Opposition actually put to me a point of order in proper order, even though I cannot agree with him because he did not give his preamble which widens the scope for the answer. I think that if everybody just listened to one another, it would assist. The Prime Minister has the call.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms GILLARD:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I go to some trouble to make that point about BlueScope Steel because, as I understand it, some of these things are already being misrepresented and I believe that it is quite wrong to misrepresent to around 1,000 working people and their families the reason that their jobs are under threat. I want to be absolutely clear before this parliament, and I think that every member of this parliament has got an obligation to be absolutely clear with individuals in the community, that this is not a decision related to the government's plans to put a price on carbon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the government's plan to put a price on carbon, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that both the government and the opposition are committed to a minus-five per cent reduction in carbon pollution by 2020. The question therefore presents that if you are going to reduce carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, do you start soon and do it in the easiest possible way or do you start late with dramatic dislocation to the economy? Well, I am for starting soon. The Leader of the Opposition is for starting late, with dramatic dislocation. I do not believe that the Leader of the Opposition's plan would be good for Australian industries and businesses because of that dramatic dislocation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Number 2, the question that presents is: do you do it in the most efficient and cheapest possible way, or do you do it in the most costly and cumbersome way? I am for doing it in the cheapest possible way. The Leader of the Opposition is for doing it in the most costly and cumbersome way. And of course in assessing that putting a price on carbon is the cheapest possible way to do it, we have relied on the advice of economists. I know that that is discounted by members opposite, but I would refer them, for example, if they are looking for sources of economic advice, to the words of the IMF where they have said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We support the proposed introduction of a carbon price as part of a transition to a permits trading system to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They went on to say in a facts sheet:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Broad based taxes on greenhouse gas emissions are the most natural policy instrument as they exploit all possible behavioural responses for reducing emissions throughout the economy …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shared minus five per cent target: we want to do it in the most efficient way. We want to do it in the way that is therefore best for Australian industries, businesses and employment. It is the Leader of the Opposition that is committed to a scheme of dislocation and job losses.</span>

Today we are seeing more extraordinary events in Libya. We have lived through a great number in the Arab spring but there are more extraordinary events on our TV screens as the story of the Arab spring continues to unfold.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have seen rebel forces reach Tripoli. They have reached Green Square. They are in the heart of the capital. There appears to be little resistance in the square itself. We have seen scenes of celebration. But we do not know the full story of what has unfolded in Tripoli. We do not know with certainty where Gaddafi is. We do not know what resistance remains. There may be more fighting ahead. But it does appear that another undemocratic regime is falling.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colonel Gaddafi, with his family, has ruled Libya with an iron grip since 1969. As has been the subject of discussion in this parliament, he brutally took up arms against his own people earlier this year. He plunged his country into what has been a bloody civil war. Some of the things that we have seen in that civil war have rightly caused horror and outrage around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under a UN Security Council mandate, the international community acted to protect civilians from Gaddafi. His regime appears to be ending. Today is a day of relief and celebration in Libya. What that means though is tomorrow a lot of hard work begins. Australia wants for Libya a peaceful, democratic and prosperous future. We know it is in reach but it is not certain. Australia has recognised the National Transitional Council as the legitimate governing authority in Libya. We were one of the first countries to call for the UN Security Council to impose a no-fly zone. We have been at the forefront of international humanitarian assistance and in the forefront of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with other members of the international community, we stand ready to support the work that will now be necessary in Libya: the work that will be necessary to end all violence; the work that will be necessary to bring Libya to a state of order; the work that will be necessary to develop a tolerant, inclusive, democratic society; and the work that will be necessary to breathe life back into Libya's battered economy. The work will be difficult and the path ahead is uncertain, but I am sure each of us has been very joyful to see the scenes of celebration today.</span>

I remind the Treasurer of Westpac's announcement that it will have to lay off staff, OneSteel's announcement that 400 jobs are going to go, Qantas's announcement that 1,000 jobs are going to go, BlueScope Steel's announcement that 1,000 jobs are going to go and that 400 contractors will lose their work too. I ask the Treasurer: on top of volatility in the United States and Europe, is now really the time to be introducing an economy wide job-destroying carbon tax that will undermine confidence and make our exports even more expensive?</span>

                  </a>  There are a lot of things that offend me about the opposition but one of the things that really offends me is how excited they get at job losses because they think there is some political credit in them for them. We on this side of the House understand the challenges, short-term and long-term, of creating a strong economy. We understand the need to maximise the opportunities that come from the mining boom. We understand the need for jobs of the future, particularly in renewable energy. Those opposite have no credit when it comes to jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House moved to protect our economy at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession. What did those opposite do? They voted against jobs in this House. When it comes to a record on jobs, we on this side of the House support jobs and we support Australian families—the 750,000 jobs that have been created while this government has been in power, the nearly 200,000 jobs that have been created. Today is a really tough day down in the Illawarra and a really tough day down in Western Port. We on this side of the House understand the gravity and the importance of this situation. We understand why it is important to put in place a range of economic policies which support our economy and future job growth. That lay at the very centre of the budget we brought down in May. We said then that we had a patchwork economy which would be impacted on by a variety of factors, and one of those is the Australian dollar. That has made life very difficult indeed for Australia's trade exposed industries. We understand that and that is why we have moved to put in place a range of policies to broaden and strengthen our economy to ensure everybody in our country, not just those in the fast lane, gets the benefit of a strong economy. That is why we on this side of the House have put in place a resource rent tax so we can give tax cuts to small business and corporate Australia more generally. That measure is opposed by those on the opposite side of the House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the importance of jobs. We understand the importance of spreading the benefits of the mining boom, we understand the importance of investing in skills and infrastructure and we understand the importance of bringing our budgets back to surplus in a responsible way, not $70 billion worth of mindless cuts from those opposite to make up for all of the thought bubbles of the Leader of the Opposition because he cannot run a fiscal policy. We on this side of the House understand the importance of fiscal policy. We understand the importance of investing in infrastructure. We understand the advantage of investing in skills. We understand productivity through investment in the NBN. But those on that side of the House just want to play cheap politics with the lives of people. We understand that we have to respond and assist those workers. We understand we need to be with those workers who are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. To do that, you have to have responsible economic policies. You cannot have a reckless Leader of the Opposition going around with thought bubbles. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I know that he and the member for Cunningham will be working with their local community as it deals with the blow that they have had today. This is very difficult news for the people of the Illawarra. It is also very difficult news for people in Hastings. We understand the patchwork of pressures that are on our economy and we have been discussing with the Australian community for a considerable period of time now the fact that our nation is in the grips of an economic transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing a global transition of economic weight from west to east. That is good for Australia, because it means that we are here in the part of the world that is growing and will continue to grow strongly and where the history of this century will be written. We understand too that our economy is going through a transition which comes from record terms of trade and strong demand for our resources. That means that our Australian dollar has been and will continue to be high. That puts pressure on export oriented industries like manufacturing, like tourism and like international education. We also understand that we need to see our economy transition to a clean energy future, and the most efficient way of doing that is to put a price on carbon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Understanding those patchwork pressures on our economy, we have seen today's announcement from BlueScope. We understand that this requires the government to respond in a series of ways. We are responding directly and nationally with BlueScope through our Steel Transformation Plan. We intend to respond to the needs of the regions involved with a plan to directly invest in economic diversification and jobs—$30 million will be available, $20 million from the federal government, $5 million from the government of New South Wales and $5 million from BlueScope itself. We are also making available $10 million in direct services and support for working people. We will also be investing in jobs in Hastings. We want to make sure that the working people who are caught up in this decision get their full entitlements, and we welcome the fact that BlueScope has said they will be paid their full entitlements. They will get the assistance that they need in skilling, training and support to get a new job. The regions affected will also get support for economic diversification.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that Australia will continue to be a nation that manufactures products that the world will want to buy. As a government, we have been strongly engaged in manufacturing. Whether through the new car plan, through our powering ideas agenda or through the work we have done on procurement and supplier advocates, we have been strongly engaged in manufacturing. I believe that we will continue to be a nation that makes things and has the benefit of high value added jobs and high wage jobs. Of course, that will mean that we will need to work with the manufacturing industry and those parts of the country that are particularly reliant on manufacturing. We will be working directly with the members for Throsby and Cunningham as we work our way through these job losses at BlueScope and the consequences for the individuals and for the community.</span>

I remind her that in the last three years 105,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost, we face the worst manufacturing employment figures since records were first kept in the 1960s and manufacturing activity has contracted for more than two years under this government. Given plummeting confidence in manufacturing in Australia, is now really the time to be introducing an economy-wide, job-destroying, confidence-crushing carbon tax?</span>

I certainly believe that means that the government does need to continue to roll out its programs and plans like the new car plan and I certainly believe that that requires us to work with manufacturing as we transition to a clean energy economy.

Now is certainly not the time to be doing that. Now is not the time to go about cutting carbon pollution in the most costly, least efficient way possible. The Leader of the Opposition's plans for a $1,300 per family slug and no industry assistance as industries transition would be dreadful for manufacturing. Of course, if he were ever elected as Prime Minister, before he got there he would be taking a direct slug of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars out of the support that we provide to manufacturing. That is the plan in writing and circulated in the community of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:32</span>):  I thank the member for Lyne for his question and for his commitment to representing constituents on the Pacific Highway up the New South Wales coast. He would be aware that we have committed some $4.1 billion to the Pacific Highway, more than any government has ever committed to any road in Australia's history over such a period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that work is proceeding apace. The Ballina bypass will be open early. It will be open by Christmas, six months ahead of schedule and on budget. Work has also commenced on the longest bridge ever constructed in Australia, which is a part of the Kempsey bypass. The builders for the Devils Pulpit upgrade have been selected and work will commence by the end of the year. The building contract for Tintenbar to Ewingsdale in the electorate of Page was also awarded in the last fortnight. Work is forging ahead on the Bulahdelah bypass, the Banora Point upgrade and the Sapphire to Woolgoolga duplication. All up, today there are more than a thousand Australians at work upgrading the Pacific Highway. Our last budget saw an additional billion dollars injected into the Pacific Highway so we could meet that objective. I was there with the member for Lyne and the member for Page with the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, following our commitment announcement in May, and I was encouraged by the very direct commitment that the Deputy Premier gave on behalf of the New South Wales government to meet our shared objective on the full duplication of the highway. Just last month he said the date 'remained plausible as long as both governments commit to it'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt this is a big challenge. All of the planning work had not been completed, which is why we needed to put that extra funding into the budget. I look forward to the New South Wales government on 6 September stumping up its share of the money in the $750 million that it has committed. New South Wales Minister for Roads Duncan Gay has 'staked his reputation on securing a major funding boost for the Pacific Highway in this year's state budget'. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">My first target and task is to fulfil that commitment in this year's budget … unless we can keep with them—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">the federal government—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">we are falling out of the game.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a vital upgrade. That is why we have contributed $4.1 billion, which stands in stark contrast to the $1.3 billion committed over 12 long years by the former government. We have committed more than triple the money in half the time because we are absolutely committed to delivering on this project. I look forward to working with the New South Wales government to meet our shared objective.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr SWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:36</span>):  I thank the member for Cunningham for that very important question, and I know she will be working very hard with locals who have been affected by this decision which has been announced today, because this House does understand, I believe, just how significant an announcement this is and what a blow it is to affected workers, their families and their communities. There is no question that this government is committed to a very strong manufacturing sector for our country, and a critical part of a strong manufacturing sector is, of course, a strong steel industry. The steel industry faces a number of challenges: rising input prices, excess global supply, weak domestic demand and, of course, a higher dollar. A higher dollar certainly delivers cheaper prices to many consumers, but it also means that more of our manufacturers are under pressure. Sadly, we are seeing the consequences of that today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the thoughts of everybody, at least on this side of the House, are with all of those workers that are affected today. That is why we will contribute $20 million to a new investment fund to support growth and new jobs in the region. BlueScope and the New South Wales government are also providing $5 million each, totalling $30 million, and we are providing a further $10 million to provide redundant workers with immediate access to intensive support, training and relocation services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also allow BlueScope to draw down up to $100 million in advance payments from the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan. This just underscores how important this plan is, and for the life of me I simply cannot understand why those opposite are opposing the Steel Transformation Plan. It is just as irresponsible as their plan to rip out $500 million in support for the automobile industry. They simply have no sense of the challenges facing manufacturing industry in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">BlueScope has provided a number of important assurances. The Port Kembla blast furnace and the metal-coating line at Western Port will be able to be reactivated if conditions improve—that is the commitment that has been given—and redundant workers will be paid their full legal entitlements. BlueScope will continue as a significant employer in the region over the life of the Steel Transformation Plan and, importantly, remains committed to steel production in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So on this side of the House we understand that, if we want to continue to have a strong manufacturing industry into the future, we do need a long-term reform plan. That is why the government is cutting company tax to 29 per cent, with a head start for small business, and using the revenue from the MRRT—once again, that very significant reform is opposed by those on the other side of the House. It is why we are putting in place major tax concessions for small business—the $6,500 instant asset write-off. Nothing could be more important to the cash flow of a small business than a $6,500 instant asset write-off, which is opposed by those of the other side of the House, for 2.7 million small businesses in our country, many of which are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. It is also why we are committed to a $3 billion skills and training package. What we are on about is putting in place the long-term reforms to strengthen and broaden our economy and to make sure the opportunities of the mining boom are spread right around our economy. We have a plan for the future; sadly, those opposite do not. They have only a plan for picking fault, scoring points and talking down our economy. That is the only plan they have. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given the new allegations about the misuse of union funds contained in the press on Friday and today, will she require the member for Dobell to make a personal explanation to the House to substantiate his claims that all these matters have been misrepresented? Does the Prime Minister still have full confidence in the member for Dobell?

No. 2: yes, I do have full confidence in the member for Dobell. No. 3: the situation continues to be as it has been for some time. Fair Work Australia has an investigation in train, and we should await the outcomes of that investigation. I also think the standards that are asked to be applied to one side of the parliament should be applied to both sides of the parliament. Whilst I am on my feet, I say to the opposition that I cannot believe that they would seek to draw into their grubby politics the question of 1,000 workers losing their jobs.</span>

                  </a>  Last Friday COAG met here in Canberra, and the Prime Minister got agreement from each of the premiers and territory leaders for national transport regulators. National transport regulators are absolutely vital in cutting this red tape that holds back the Australian economy and that causes safety issues because of the varying regulations that are there in the economy. What I have here are real books—these are real books that exist in the cabs of D&amp;S Haulage Pty Ltd. This is a company based in Tumby Bay in South Australia. The President, Mr David Smith, who I have met with a number of times, is the immediate past president of the Australian Livestock Transporters Association. These four folders are the actual paperwork, with the different state and territory regulations and approvals, that is in the cab of every one of the 16 trucks that he owns.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will, as a result of last Friday's efforts—with a $30 billion benefit to the national economy over 20 years—get rid of all of it, as a result of the reform. This is real, practical change as a result of this government's commitment to microeconomic reform and improving productivity. No more will they have to deal with different weight regulations. No more will they have to deal with the current situation whereby a B-double in Queensland can have 66 cattle on it, when they get to the New South Wales border they are only allowed 60 cattle. So what do they do? Offload the six cattle at the border; just like they have different weight provisions; just like they have different fatigue laws. These are the real issues that this government is dealing with, which is why the Australian trucking industry, the Livestock Transporters Association and the Australian Logistics Council have all been working with this government to achieve this real change.</span>

I refer the Prime Minister to the draft Clean Energy Bill, which will require landfill managers to estimate the emissions that the rubbish they receive will emit for 30 years and then estimate the cost of those emissions for 30 years so that they can determine the price they should charge householders when next they take a load of rubbish to the tip. Can the Prime Minister explain how this is possible?</span>

                  </a>  I would say to the Leader of the Opposition abuse is not a substitute for reason and he may want to go to some of the landfill sites where, for example, today they are collecting these emissions and today they are using those emissions to generate electricity for nearby households. In answer to the Leader of the National Party's question, I say that this is taking us back again to the Leader of the Opposition's proposition that apparently you cannot measure or track carbon pollution. If he really believes that, how can he support a minus five per cent target? How can he? This is him doing or saying anything. In front of people he believes are supporters of climate change denial he will get the kind of questions we have just had asked today. In front of audiences like those when he is blogging on Mamamia he will say he is in support of a minus five per cent target. But if the Leader of the Opposition genuinely believes that it is impossible to track carbon pollution he should get to the dispatch box and say he does not support a minus five per cent target. If he does support a minus five per cent target he should stop these stupid questions being asked.</span>

Australia is a founding member of the global trading system, which has well established rules for the conduct of trade between member nations. Members are bound to comply with those rules. If they do not, other member countries can take retaliatory action against them. There are now 153 members of the World Trade Organization and more are trying to join up each year—that is, people want to be inside the World Trade Organization: inside those rules not outside. Yet the opposition leader would recklessly breach world trading rules and tear up trade agreements with our regional trading partners. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow agriculture minister has introduced into parliament a bill on New Zealand apples that would violate the world trading rules and expose innocent farmers, including those in Capricornia, to retaliation. The coalition, in addition, is supporting a private member's bill on palm oil labelling, which risks provoking a trade war with Malaysia and Indonesia. Indeed, the opposition leader's antitrade agenda extends to his opposition to international trading in carbon permits.</span>

                  </a>  I was making the point that the opposition leader's opposition to international trade extends to trading internationally in carbon permits, because in fact he believes, almost uniquely within this parliament—the member for Ryan probably agrees with him—that one tonne of carbon weighs, wait for it, nothing. This is the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. He says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">See, one of the things that people haven't quite twigged to is that carbon dioxide is invisible, it's weightless and it's odourless. How are we going to police these emissions…</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is weightless, yet he has promised to cut emissions of a gas, that he describes as weightless, by 140 million tonnes. A 140 million tonnes of weightless gas! He is going to be going pretty hard to do that, isn't he? He is going to cut emissions by 140 million tonnes of weightless gas! I do not always agree with the member for Wentworth but I agree with this statement of his. He said:</span>

I think the member had missed something absolutely pivotal and central to the scheme, which is that the entities paying the carbon price are the biggest polluters. So where the price signal is working, it is working as a price signal to the biggest polluters to innovate and to change the way that they conduct business. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is exactly the same mechanism that the John Howard emissions trading scheme had at its heart, which was supported by the Leader of the Opposition and all of the members of the front bench who were ministers at the time. So at the moment these businesses that generate carbon pollution can put any amount of carbon pollution into the atmosphere for no cost. It does not matter if next year you put more up into the atmosphere than this year because it is at no cost. Why would you bother innovating to reduce the amount of carbon pollution? You do not face any costs. So the way in which carbon pricing will work—</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, on a point of order of direct relevance: the Prime Minister was simply asked how a price signal is allowed to work if in fact a business is fined for increasing its prices.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms GILLARD:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I am responding directly to the question. I was asked about price signals and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and we are now seeing something that perhaps explains the grand confusion about these questions amongst some members of the opposition. The price is paid by the biggest polluters. Of course, as rational business people, they will seek to reduce that price and as they seek to reduce that price they will innovate and change the way that they do business and cut the amount of carbon pollution they generate. If you move amongst the Australian business community, and I know the member who asked the question does that, you will meet and be able to have discussions with business people who can talk to you about their innovation plans to reduce carbon pollution because they know that carbon pricing is coming and will start on 1 July next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the member is also referring to is that there is some flowthrough from carbon pricing into the prices of things that people buy and that impact—the Leader of the Opposition in his scare campaign has said that impact is 'astronomical'—is 0.7 per cent of CPI and households are being assisted so that around four million households will come out better off and around six million households will be fully compensated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As prices change in shops, yes, you will see an effect where goods that have less carbon pollution imbedded in them will be relatively cheaper, but we want those price signals to be true price signals not the results of price gouging, which is why, yes, we will have very strong fines and penalties for anybody who goes through and price gouges—that is, they adjust a price in a way that is disproportionate and not as a result of carbon pricing and then claim to the consumer that the price has only been changed because of carbon pricing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To come back to the reasons behind this question, if the member has fundamentally misunderstood the scheme I would suggest to him that he look at it again. I know he is on the public record as saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When it comes to economic issues, my instinct is for open markets, free competition …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that is right, he should be endorsing an emissions trading scheme and not the red tape regulation and burdens that the Leader of the Opposition would use to smash Australian businesses and to smash Australian jobs. The other thing I would suggest is that he endorse the government's plan to make sure there that there is no price gouging.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: I move that the Prime Minister's time be extended by no more than two minutes to give her the opportunity to answer the question on how a business can increase its prices at the same time as it is being fined for increasing its prices and therefore operate a price signal that she has tried to describe in the last four minutes but has failed to do so. I would give her the opportunity in the next two minutes to answer the question.</span>

I appreciate that members on this side of the House are interested in how our health reforms are delivering. Unfortunately, it is two years since I have had a question from the shadow minister on health reform and this is despite the historic delivery that our government has been able to achieve through health reform. Seventy thousand extra elective surgeries and not a question from those opposite. An increase of 50 per cent in funding for hospitals and not a question from those opposite. The MyHospitals website and not a question from those opposite. Local hospital networks up and running in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT and now a long-term reform package to increase funding transparency, efficiency and beds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the member for Corangamite's electorate as an example. Our health reform means that there are going to be five palliative care beds at Colac hospital and eight new subacute beds at Geelong Hospital. Our GP superclinic on the Bellarine Peninsula has been running for nearly one year, providing services and training staff in partnership with Deakin University. Medicare Locals are up and running in 19 communities, including the electorates of Corangamite and Corio. There is a new breast-care nurse working in the region and we have put nurse practitioners and midwife consultations onto the MBS for the first time as well as specialist telehealth consultations which can be accessed by all of rural and regional Australia if their specialist is in the city and not accessible to them. Throughout all of these reforms that are being delivered, not just in the electorate of Corangamite but across the country, we have not had one question on health reform from the opposition. For two years, the shadow minister has not thought it worthwhile to ask us one question. You have to ask: why is this? Is it because the Leader of the Opposition is so embarrassed about his history in this area that they just do not want to ask a question? Is it because the member for Dickson actually has not thought of a question that can be asked? Or perhaps he has no policies at all that he can raise with us to ask whether we would pursue them as part of our health reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also update the House on how some of our other health reforms are delivering benefits to the community. Our preventative health initiatives have seen drops in consumption of both alcopops and cigarettes. One of our most recent investments is making a real difference—that is, our GP after-hours phone line. I can now announce to the House that, just since 1 July this year, 20,000 services have been provided by that GP after-hours service. We have increased the number of GPs that can be trained across the country. The Leader of the Opposition had a cap of 600 GPs to be trained every year; since his time as health minister, we have another 475 extra GPs in training and we are going to increase that to 1,200. Again, in the member for Corangamite's electorate, there are six new trainees as GPs. This story is told across the country, whether you go to the electorates of our regional Independents, the electorates of the backbench on the other side or the electorates that we represent. Health reform is delivering to the community, and those opposite have not asked a question about it.</span>

                  </a>  I know that there have been some issues about modelling raised in the Victorian newspapers which may have brought this question to the member's mind. What I can say to the member is that the modelling projects that the economy of Victoria will grow by 30 per cent to 2020 alone and by 162 per cent by 2050. These are not some of the results that people have recently seen in their newspapers.</span>

                  </a>  The Treasury modelling is accurate in showing the macroeconomic effects of carbon pricing, and I am referring him to those macroeconomic effects. I understand that there have been debates started about modelling, including modelling at a subregional level. Modelling at a subregional level is not reliable, and Treasury makes that point very strongly indeed. So I say to the member for Dunkley, who may, like other members of the Victorian community, have seen some misleading results in their newspapers, that we stand by, and people should rely on, the Treasury modelling.</span>

He, like so many on this side of the House, understands the importance of encouraging the regions to be their best and the key role that governments play in enabling them to do that. It is essential that we secure the future of the regions because, if we get that done properly, that also secures the future of the nation. That is why we have taken the conscious step of reinvigorating the commitment we make to the regions in terms of not just the structures that we have encouraged but also the resources that enable them to undertake their activities.</span>

The interesting message that has come from all of the regions that I and others have had the opportunity to visit is that they get the fact that it is important to diversify their economic base, because it is the regions that have diversified their economic base that are doing best in terms of the 750,000 additional jobs that this government has created. What we are saying is that the lesson that other regions have to learn is to diversify their base. Why? Because we are projecting another 1.6 million jobs by the year 2020, and it is up to the regions to determine how much of that action they get—their slice of that increase in jobs. That is why it is important that government programs are there to assist. That is why there are a package of measures in the budget to help the economy in transition, to invest in skills, to invest in infrastructure and to invest in innovation. That is why, in the cleaner energy package, there are a range of measures that help economies make the transition to a cleaner energy future. I was also asked by the honourable member what obstacles may stand in the way of this. I will tell you what the obstacle would be: electing a government that is built around negativity and fear. The Leader of the Opposition, in talking about the Latrobe Valley, has been saying that they are going to be finished. We know that when the Kennett government were in and privatised the electricity industry, they did it without any industry support. Now, when we put forward our industry support measures, the Baillieu government wants to ignore that in its modelling. The Leader of the Opposition went to Whyalla and said that they would be wiped off the face of the earth because of the clean energy future, when we said that 1,300 more jobs would be created.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to the Illawarra region—the area that is being talked of today—on a number of occasions with the members concerned. I know that the people of that region are committed to diversifying their economic base. As important as the steel sector is to them, they know that they cannot have an industry so narrowly based that their economy is focused around it alone, and they have welcomed the initiatives that this government has put in place to assist them make their economy in transition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to support these regions in their work. They know where their future lies. They know their strengths. They have identified the hurdles and they want to work with a government that is going to help them overcome those barriers. We know that if the opposition were to get into government they would cut those programs with their $70 billion black hole. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Can the Prime Minister inform Mr Fulton and the thousands of Australians in the not-for-profit disability sector, and those who provide homes and arrangements for the disabled, how they will be compensated for the increased costs of construction as a result of her government's carbon tax?</span>

First and foremost, on construction costs: construction predominantly relies on things that have the maximum assistance rate—things like cement, for example. So I would refer the member to that. There have been some very exaggerated figures in the public domain about impacts on construction costs. Should the member have read any of those figures and be inclined to believe them, I would point the member to the fact that the inputs for construction tend to be things that have the maximum rates of assistance.</span>

They are amongst the pensioner households who will, on average, come out $210 in front when you take into account all of the effects of carbon pricing. Thirdly, in terms of the way in which the government works, for example, with state governments on disability services, payments under those intergovernmental agreements are indexed. Normally an element of that indexation is what has happened in CPI movements. It is weighed in the index and—</span>

                  </a>  I am being reminded that the current indexation for the national disability agreement is three times the indexation paid under the former government. But my point in relation to carbon pricing is that, as the 0.7 per cent comes into the CPI, the CPI tends to be an input for indexation of government payments. So there is an increase there that flows as a result of the CPI arrangements.</span>

Last week the OECD released a very important report on education, <span style="font-style:italic;">OECD r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eviews of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">valuation and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ssessment in </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ducation</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ustralia</span>, and unambiguously gave this government a big tick on education reform. I want to quote briefly from what the OECD review team said. They said, 'The overall evaluation and assessment framework appears as highly sophisticated and well conceptualised.' They went on to say that 'particularly positive' features include a focus on student outcomes, a coherent system of assessments for learning, a structure to integrate accountability and improvement, and the commitment to transparency. We could not have put it any better if we had tried. My School, national testing and the Australian curriculum got a huge vote of confidence by the OECD looking at national progress on education and the Gillard government's reforms in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The review also pointed towards further improvement, and there it identified the very policies that we took to the last election and are now delivering—a national performance management system for teachers, rewarding our best teachers, identifying our best schools, providing rewards for school improvements, and empowering local schools by allowing them to make decisions about what works best in their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this government is committed to making every school a great school. The architecture is in place and the next tranche of reforms will take the reform even further. Let us remember the context: significant improvement of the facilities of schools in the country through the Building the Education Revolution, providing some $2.5 billion to our nation's schools to lift the performance of students who are falling behind and to improve teacher quality. This government is spending over $65 billion on education—nearly twice what was spent previously by the coalition. Unfortunately, every time the shadow cabinet sits down to look at funding cuts education is on the chopping block. The fact is that Mr Abbott and the coalition are already on the record as committing to some $2.8 billion out of education. While the shadow minister for education trails his coat on foreign policy and, it seems, writes very literate essays about China, at the same time when they meet in the shadow cabinet all they are doing is contemplating cuts in education. He admitted on <span style="font-style:italic;">Meet the Press</span> recently that education would not be spared from the $70 billion that the opposition is contemplating cutting from our budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is $5 billion or $10 billion or $15 billion—and $15 billion, incidentally, is a quarter of our education budget—the fact is that these reforms are absolutely essential to the nation's prosperity and progress. But the sorts of cuts that the opposition has in place mean that NAPLAN is gone, My School is gone, the Australian curriculum is gone, teaching standards are gone and remaining trades training centres are gone. And the policies identified by the OECD that this government wants to put in place—performance management systems for teachers, local school empowerment and digital technology opportunities; all of those things—are gone under an opposition that does not know how important education is for the future of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to deliver those education reforms and to make every school a great school.</span>

I refer the Prime Minister to the outcome of the reality TV show <span style="font-style:italic;">The Block</span> last night, in which three out of the four homes failed to reach the reserve during the auction and were passed in. I further refer her to the fact that a building company in Griffith, which sold 62 house and land packages in the year leading up to October last year, has not sold a single one since. Given plummeting confidence in the housing market and building industry, is now really the time to be introducing a carbon tax which will add at least $5,000 to the cost of a new house?</span>

I am not sure whether anybody has been holding up their number 10 sign, but I think that should have got a 10 for the most creative question of the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am afraid that I could not watch the television show that he refers to last night. I am sure I would have enjoyed it, but I did not have an opportunity to watch it. What I can say to him about construction costs is what I said to the earlier member: actually, there are some very inflated estimates floating around about impacts on construction costs because the things that are predominantly used in construction are the things with the maximum assistance rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say to him about confidence questions is that, yes, there are a series of things that are impacting on consumer confidence. We have had the opportunity today to talk in question time about the patchwork pressures on our economy. I think that that is showing on consumer confidence. I think the overhang from the global financial crisis is showing. People are alive to risks around the world, and their TV screens over the last few weeks have presented to them images of risk from the US, with the political gridlock around fiscal consolidation, and then, of course, from Europe with some of its sovereign debt problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe, too, that there has been an impact on consumer confidence as people have seen an outworking of the global financial crisis with reductions in their superannuation earnings. Some people have become concerned about their house prices; not necessarily that they have gone backwards but that the rate of growth that they would have liked to have seen in their house price is not going to be as strong as they would initially have envisaged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of pressures on people, but I would say to the member that I hope he is out in his local community explaining to people that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. I hope he takes the opportunity, too, when he is in party room meetings with the Leader of the Opposition, to explain that it is not in the interests of his constituents for the Leader of the Opposition to misrepresent the impacts of carbon pricing day after day and to talk the Australian economy down.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  I would like to thank the member for La Trobe for her question because we on this side of the House know that people being able to retire, and not to retire poor, is very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House we believe in the value of increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. Twelve per cent is good for individuals; it means that they do not have to retire poor. Twelve per cent is good for taxpayers because it will relieve pressure on the age pension in the next 20 and 30 years. In fact, 12 per cent is good for the whole nation. We are the fourth largest capital funds under management market in the world. There is not a lot that Australia is fourth in the world at, but having a large savings pool is one of those accomplishments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The value of having those sorts of savings under management in Australia is that it helps to decrease our cost of capital and it means that we have resources here which are the envy of the rest of the world in terms of our savings. But in fact, when we talk about those who benefit, something like eight million Australians will directly benefit from the increase from nine to 12 per cent. That is the number of Australians who do not currently receive 12 per cent superannuation: eight million people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for La Trobe may be interested to know that in her seat, based on 2007-08 tax returns, something like 53,600 people would be better off with this policy. The opposition leader may be interested in a number: in the seat of Warringah something like 55,000 of his voters currently get less than 12 per cent. The member for Wide Bay, too, may be interested that 37,000 voters in his electorate currently do not get 12 per cent superannuation. We all know that life expectancy is increasing and we all know that the garden variety nine per cent super is not going to be enough for most people to retire on. Thirty in every 100 Australians are getting better than nine per cent but there are 70 in every 100 who are not. It is also important that we increase the life savings for women workers who do not get the same chances on average to accrue the same amount of money that they would at nine per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House we want to take the pressure off future generations. We do not want to be here in 20 years time saying, 'Remember when we had the opportunity to finish the job and lift superannuation from nine to 12 per cent?' After all, when we talk about missed opportunities it was 20 years ago that the Keating government passed legislation to increase super from three to nine per cent. But, of course, there was one group of people who opposed super going from three to nine per cent and we all know who that was. It was the opposition. It has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity on superannuation. It opposed it then and I believe that it opposes increasing compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion it begs one question: how can those opposite, knowing that so many tens of thousands of their voters stand to improve from nine to 12 per cent, receive their defined benefits super or 15.4 per cent superannuation? Got to love the hypocrisy—you take it for yourself but you will not give it to other people. It is not fair and we intend to change that for all Australians rather than the opposition who yet again will be on the wrong side of history.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  There are reports today that many vehicles which had travelled from around Australia today as part of the 'convoy of no confidence' were denied their democratic right to access the parliamentary circle to lawfully protest against the government and their policies. Could you undertake to investigate whether these reports are correct and, if so, upon whose direction the 'convoy of no confidence' was denied their democratic right to access the parliamentary circle today?</span>

                </a>  by Senator Lee Rhiannon at the Politics in the Pub meeting held at the Gaelic Club in Sydney on 22 July 2011. I have received a copy of a transcript of that event where Senator Rhiannon outlined in great detail a misleading critique of my position with regard to my opposition to the BDS campaign of Marrickville Council supporting a boycott of Israel. Nowhere in her comments, where she was critical of my engagement in the issue, did she state the fact that the resolution carried by Marrickville Council was that Marrickville Council write to the local, state and federal ministers informing them of the council's position and seeking their support at the state and federal levels for the global BDS movement; nor did she outline that on 12 January the general manager had a letter which was held back that stated: 'In accordance with the provisions of part 3 of the resolution I wish to formally advise you of the council's decision in this matter and seek your personal support for council's initiative by raising the issue in the state parliament, the federal parliament and urging your parliamentary colleagues to contemplate support for similar action.'</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Rhiannon went on to state to the meeting: 'Then what happens is that on 14 January 2011 in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>there is an opinion piece by Anthony Albanese. This is an opinion piece that really lays out the form in which the whole BDS debate will go in the coming months.' What she did not state was that on the day before, 13 January, the mayor, Fiona Byrne, put a position on abc.net.au, on The Drum website. Through the position she went on to say that I opposed broader involvement by local government in broad issues. I did not and my article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> made it clear that I did not. I opposed the specific campaign by the Greens on Marrickville Council.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  When I was interrupted, I was outlining some of the concerns that we on this side of the House still have with the proposed national curriculum. In the first instance I was referring to our concern about the lack of an overall framework, which governs the national curriculum, and the lack of clear direction, which underpins it. I was then moving on to talk about the fact that the curriculum has a very heavy emphasis on Asian and Indigenous culture but does not give a similar weight to our British heritage or our Judeo-Christian traditions. I advise the House that they should read the IPA's monograph on the national curriculum. It is called <span style="font-style:italic;">The national curriculum</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—a critique</span>. It noted that Western culture and civilisation are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">… v</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">irtually absent from the national curriculum as it is currently conceived.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is an area which needs to be re-examined, relooked at and incorporated into the national curriculum in terms of our overall British and Western heritage and our Judeo-Christian heritage, which we inherited, as well as Asian and Indigenous culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the other concerns that we have raised are over the lack of appropriate resources which will be attached to the implementation of the national curriculum. There many other issues which Christopher Pyne, the shadow minister for education, has raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are moving two amendments to enhance the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill. The first is to ensure that schools are provided with appropriate support to implement the national curriculum. One of our criticisms has been that there has not been that support in the form of professional development training for teachers to implement the curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second is to ensure that there is a clear representation of the non-government school sector with respect to decision-making processes for future time lines of the national curriculum. Again, one of the problems I was referring to beforehand was that the non-government school sector was out of sync with the government school sector. I think part of that has come about due to the fact that the non-government school sector has not been at the decision-making table. These amendments would ensure that they are always at the decision-making table on issues which affect their schools. Given that they make up a third of all school students in the country, it seems to be a very sensible thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude by saying that, like many things the government has touched, the national curriculum has involved delays, bungles and underdelivery against the government's rhetoric. This national curriculum was supposed to be finished and implemented by January 2011. Of course it has not been and now probably will not be implemented until 2013 or 2014. It was supposed to be a smooth process but it has not been anything of the sort. In fact, every single stakeholder group has in some respect complained about the drafts that have been presented and asked for significant changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it was supposed to have been delivered already according to the Prime Minister's own words of July 2010 when she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">This nation</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">s talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She has not delivered it. It is nowhere near being delivered. It will be several years late from when she claimed she delivered it, but I suggest she takes that time and gets the national curriculum right because it will have a significant impact across all schools in our community. It needs to be properly thought through and properly considered and the government needs to get the content right. As I have mentioned before in this House, we ideally should have bipartisan support, at least in relation to the broad framework of the national curriculum, so that schools in the future can have confidence that it will not be chopped and changed but, rather, there will be a consistent framework governing the curriculum going forward.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHEESEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  Today I take the opportunity to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill, which deals with the national curriculum in Australian schools. I think it is extremely important that we have a consistent and uniform curriculum across all schools in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian education has changed enormously over the decades. I particularly want to draw to the House's attention the fact that families are more transient than ever before. Long gone are the days when kids would remain in the same school to receive their education. The reality is that families these days have to move from town to town or state to state, and it is important that those children are not disadvantaged as a consequence of the work pattern that their parents have to undertake. That is why it is important that we have a standard uniform curriculum that provides young people with the opportunity to move from school to school, state to state and to be able to pick up almost where they left off at their previous school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important that that curriculum remains modern and contemporary for the needs of our nation and the needs of those families and students. Long gone are the days when we studied history, particularly in the context of colonialisation and British history. We have a much more diverse history than that, and our curriculum needs to recognise that. It needs to build on that and reflect the great tradition and diversity we have in Australia. It also needs to instil in students creative thinking and an understanding of ethical behaviour. Personal and social consequences and intercultural understanding are an important part and are important Australian values, and our curriculum needs to very clearly recognise that and instil in our young people the necessary skills to be able to respond to what is now a very multicultural society. The details of these bills are important and I would like to take some time to go through them. The regulation will prescribe as the national curriculum any new version of the Australian Curriculum authorised by the Council of Australian Governments Standing Council for School Education and Early Childhood. The amendment will provide a more certain legal framework for the non-government sector in which to implement the national curriculum and provide greater administrative efficiency for prescribing the phased introduction of the curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a world-class curriculum that recognises the 21st century. We have a world-class curriculum in the development of skills and knowledge in all of the important areas—English, mathematics, science and history, with development in geography, languages and arts well underway to be implemented at a later time. For the first time, students all over Australia will be studying the same curriculum in the four key areas. As I mentioned earlier, families move around much more than they have historically. State boundaries have become a problem for students and families, particularly when it comes to slotting kids into new schools in different areas. They find that subjects that they have already learnt are now being taught and that they miss out on other subjects through the course of their studies.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important that we recognise that we have two forms of school education in Australia: one provided by the states and territories and the other provided by independent providers. As students move between government schools, students also move between private and independent schools and government schools and vice versa. Again, it is important that we recognise that fact and have uniformity of education wherever possible, particularly in the key fundamental areas of education such as English, languages, science, mathematics, the arts and the like. That is extremely important.</span>

My electorate covers some 7,000 square kilometres and many of my students have to travel some distance to access education. All of those families require quality education for their children. I would also like to point out that not only have we in the government been busy with respect to establishing decent curriculum standards across this nation but also we have invested substantially in the infrastructure that is required to help support modern education, whether through the provision of language labs in secondary schools or libraries and multipurpose classrooms and the like in primary schools—again, providing flexible learning spaces that give students every opportunity to access that curriculum in a modern way.</span>

To deliver curriculum in schools in a modern way, you need modern facilities, and the BER program provided modern facilities for schools. Having said that, there are some schools that still require further assistance with the building of infrastructure so that they can deliver a modern, flexible curriculum that responds to national need, and Portarlington Primary School and Birregurra Primary School are two examples of schools that are old and need investment. Whilst those school communities have very much appreciated the BER investment in those schools, it is incumbent upon the state government to come to the table and help support those school communities in their time of need.</span>

This government has done more to reform education in all sectors than any other government has done since Federation. Our side, the Labor Party, is very proud of that. We recognise that the best way to give a student a decent life is to give them a decent education, and the cornerstone of that is having a strong curriculum that is flexible and creative and enables our students to grow in a way that we all can be extremely proud of.</span>

If we want to have a curriculum that delivers strongly for students in our electorates we need to make sure that we provide the facilities that are appropriate to the curriculum, and trades training will provide opportunities to young people.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  I rise to speak to the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. The Schools Assistance Act 2008 currently provides for the funding arrangements for non-government schools to be continued upon implementation of the national curriculum by 31 January 2012. With the legislation as it now stands, if the curriculum is not implemented by the stated date the Australian government could require reimbursement of these funds. The amendment proposed in the bill repeals the implementation date of 31 January 2012 and replaces it with a standing regulation that takes into account the staged development and implementation of the national curriculum. Also, the proposed amendment provides that the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood and Youth Affairs will determine new timelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the initial legislation on the national curriculum was drafted in 2008, it was anticipated that the national curriculum would be finalised and ready to be rolled out by the beginning of 2011. However, the government underestimated the complexities of the task at hand, and the national curriculum is far from finalised. Like most programs developed by this Labor government, the development of the national curriculum has been poorly managed. The coalition is supportive of the principle of an Australian curriculum; however, the final version has not been approved and most jurisdictions will not begin its implementation until 2013. The legislation before us therefore needs amendment. It should be noted that the coalition attempted to make the necessary amendments in March this year; but at that point the minister seemed unaware that there would be a problem.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the guiding principles that have informed the development of the national curriculum, and, as guiding principles, they are admirable in their intent. However the requirement to amend this legislation highlights delays in the rollout of the curriculum and concerns associated with its development that have not been addressed. The fact that this parliament needs to consider this bill is evidence that the Labor government has not delivered on its commitment. In April 2008, the Labor Prime Minister promised 'A national curriculum publicly available and which can start to be delivered in all jurisdictions from January 2011'. One year ago during the election campaign the Labor Prime Minister said: 'This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' The documents are still far from ready and there continue to be significant concerns with the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority is continuing to develop the national curriculum. The initial consultation on the K to year 10 documents for English, maths, science and history occurred between March and May of last year. Comments were incorporated and further consultation with expert educators was undertaken. The Labor government is planning to present a final draft to education ministers in October of this year for approval at the ministerial council. A similar process is being followed for the senior curriculum and its development is continuing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as mentioned, there have been a number of issues associated with the development of the national curriculum. The first of these is that there was inadequate representation of the non-government sector on the relevant subcommittee reporting to the ministerial council. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2010, 71 per cent of schools in Australia were public schools, with the remaining 29 per cent Catholic or independent schools. In the same year, the total number of students in Australian schools increased by 26,071 with 63 per cent of that figure comprising private school students. Since 2000, the number of students in private schools has increased by 21 per cent, whereas the number of students in public schools has increased only by one per cent. Given these figures, is it not unreasonable to expect that a sector that is currently servicing a third of our children and is growing should have a voice on the subcommittee?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents are voting with their feet and exercising their right to choose where and how their children are educated. In the coalition we support the right of parents to choose which school their children attend. We believe the independent sector should be maintained as a viable choice for as many parents as possible. We also recognise that every child that is in the private system is a child that is not placing a burden on taxpayer funded public education. Freedom of choice is a key Liberal value and is one that many members of my community have exercised when choosing schools for their children. In this context, we believe that the independent school sector should also have a strong voice on the subcommittee reporting to the ministerial council and the sector should also have a say in the decisions regarding implementation time frames.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature of the curriculum documents themselves has also been questioned. The Labor government's curriculum documents lack clarity of direction and an overarching framework. We are concerned that there is too much ideology driving the content of the curriculum. For example, there is a predominant focus in Indigenous and Asian culture without similar weight being given to British heritage or our Judeo-Christian traditions. This raises serious concerns about the balance and the content that is going to be taught in our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, there are concerns that the national curriculum is overcrowded, meaning that many schools will be left without the flexibility to deliver programs that correspond with their particular philosophy—for example, in the area of the arts. There is also an excessive focus on content rather than the development of essential critical and creative thinking skills in students. Furthermore, the documents appear not to have enough flexibility to cater for children who require additional support or those who are particularly talented. Issues have been raised regarding, for example, the science curriculum documents which are purported to be so difficult that students may actually be discouraged from studying the sciences. This would be a terrible outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other concern with the national curriculum, separate from the documents themselves, lies in how it is to be implemented. Teachers have expressed serious concerns with regard to the support they receive as the curriculum is rolled out. The Federal President of the Australian Education Union said recently 'We're seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation'. The unions should be concerned. This government's track record at delivering programs is absolutely abysmal—think pink batts, think school halls. The national curriculum is far too important to go the same way as these failed programs. A rollout without the necessary training and support for our teachers who will have to deliver the content is a recipe for the disasters that have become the hallmark of this Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to go some way towards dealing with a couple of these issues, we urge members opposite to support the amendments the coalition is moving. The first of these will underscore the importance of ensuring that schools and teachers receive the support and professional training they require in order to effectively implement the curriculum. The second amendment will ensure that the independent school sector receives representation and is consulted on the time lines associated with the implementation of the curriculum. The coalition supports the legislative amendment proposed by this bill in recognition that implementation of the national curriculum is going to take much longer than originally anticipated and is yet another failed Labor promise. A three-year implementation for phase 1 of the Australian curriculum commencing this year with implementation by 2013 is likely. However, a time frame for phase 1 of the senior secondary curriculum is yet to be agreed. Furthermore, updates to the curriculum will be required from time to time. The amendment is designed to provide a mechanism whereby the staged introduction and any amendments can be accommodated. However, there are worrying deficiencies in the process. There is no non-government sector representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee, which reports to the ministerial council, and there is no plan to support teachers and schools in the implementation of the curriculum. They are areas of significant concern. The coalition's amendments address these issues.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  In December 2010, the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs endorsed the foundation to year 10 Australian curriculum in the initial four learning areas of English, mathematics, science and history. Ministers agreed that from 2011 states and territories will commence staged implementation of the agreed Australian curriculum, with substantial implementation to be completed by the end of 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time for change and to re-evaluate how education is provided and how it can best be delivered. Over time the need for a national curriculum has become clear. In the past people did not move as much and often one completed one's education in the same town or region. Now people are much more footloose and have to move more from state to state to find work. Having a national curriculum allows children to be able to be assessed against their peers, because they will not have the disadvantage of trying to get used to different systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to use this opportunity to talk about education generally and how we should look further at change. We need more flexibility in where one undertakes schooling. Recently we had a situation in Tasmania where many of our country schools had come under threat of closure because of budget cuts. Suddenly there was a list of 20 schools that were earmarked for closure without any consultation with their communities or their families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> It may have passed without comment in the past, but the way it was thrust onto these communities had them up in arms. Twenty school communities went out and manned barricades. They used modern tools such as Facebook for communications, and they had families from the schools together raising funds and awareness. In 18 days they achieved a ministerial backdown. The decision makers were surprised and shocked at the reaction. But the state government, although chastened, put out a message that it was not over yet. A teacher friend of mine, Ivan Webb, offered this analysis of the situation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… 20 Tasmanian school communities are already better prepared for what is to come. These communities still have Facebook and a whole new set of knowledge, skills, experiences, networks and relationships and a clearer sense of their own identities. They have transformed their initial sense of being at the edge of chaos into something that could be very useful to all concerned—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and which needs to be sustained and developed. He went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Managed well, there is a close potential link between innovation and being at the edge of chaos, but it does require a change of mindset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot think of anything that the policy decision makers—government and government departments—have to enable them to match what the school communities have done in 18 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Admittedly the nature of the schemes has changed, particularly since the arrival of the internet and systems that are now networks, often to larger anonymous agents. Systems, including school systems, can no longer be treated as production lines with an overlay of organisational trees that describe the relative status, power and authority of those involved. Closing a school is not something that can be done on the basis of numbers; it is a complex and uncertain task with broad ramifications. Parents and communities place a very high value on the current wellbeing and long-term success of their children. When it comes to success and wellbeing, parents and communities are confident about their local schools. Their confidence in the minister, government and the department has been severely undermined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">School closures failed this time for two reasons: they were based on a very narrow discourse and they were set up as win-lose and would have resulted in a net loss. The losses to the students, their families and community would have been far greater than the modest financial gains to the government. The next step is for the lessons to be learned. This means taking advantage of the current situation to learn as much as possible and develop a new sustainable dialogue around all schools—what they are for and how to manage their futures. The important conversation we need to have is not just between some schools and the government. The fundamental fight is about how we as a state understand, talk about, utilise and value our schools and their futures: what they are, what they do and how they make things possible. And this involves all schools, communities, governments and departments. The conversation really counts, and it needs to be ongoing, not just happening when there is an urgent need for the government to reduce spending. The conversation should include the full range of direct and indirect costs, benefits, values, relationships and possibilities associated with schools. These are best captured as stories of real people in real contexts, as schools have demonstrated. This is what schools have all been gathering to share in recent weeks, and it has worked well for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schools should look after their stories well. There will come a time when they will be needed again—not only for the sake of the school but also to help the decision makers make better decisions next time. Hopefully the proposed reference group will be wise enough to tap into this goldmine before it dissipates. Governments worldwide are reducing spending, and this will continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be successful, the conversation needs to be open, rich and interactive—not constrained by a narrow set of terms of reference with a particular outcome in mind. It needs to lead to innovation and overall win-win outcomes, which may or may not result in some actual closures. The schools have demonstrated that this can be done. Facebook has played a key role. There are tools for enabling even more focused and productive outcomes. It is now time for ministers, governments and departments to catch up. I think we should be aware of this in the federal sphere too. There was some criticism of this government providing funds under the Building the Education Revolution—yet schools in my electorate were able to renew their education spaces for the first time in some 50 or more years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The renewals included new technology as well as buildings. This means students are able to use interactive whiteboards as a learning tool, which not only puts a bit of fun into their learning but also means they can be in touch with other children around the state, the country and even the world to undertake learning programs as well as maths games and games with numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By unwittingly providing the tools to galvanise their communities against school closures, they have also prepared their schools to go out into the community and help be part of the local economy, the driving force behind future directions. Isn't that what education is all about—preparing our children to help Tasmania thrive and develop new jobs and new directions and to build a viable future for themselves?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />With the latest in digital technology, computers, laptops and videophones, children can communicate with the rest of world very easily. They do not have to move further than their classroom to catch up with the latest trends at the next big school or an equivalent school in, say, Ireland or any other country in the world. It is all there at their fingertips. Smaller schools allow greater participation in this style of reality learning. And students do not have to miss out on sporting or other extracurricular activities either— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. The bill will amend the act to repeal the current implementation date of 31 January 2012 and substitute a new provision enabling a standing regulation to prescribe a national curriculum and associated implementation time frames. This means that, subject to the passage of this bill, there will no longer be a deadline or due date in legislation from when the national curriculum is required to commence. Instead, to allow for future additions and revisions to the nation curriculum, the government is proposing that any version will need approval by the Council of Australian Governments' Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood, formerly known as the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs. The implementation time frames will be prescribed as those agreed by the standing council. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us today is clear evidence that the Labor Party have failed to deliver on their commitment to a nation curriculum. If they had delivered on the national curriculum I would not need to stand here today before the parliament to talk to this bill. The explanatory memorandum of the bill states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the time of the Act's drafting in 2008, an implementation deadline of 31 January 2012 was anticipated for the development and rollout of the national curriculum across the school sector. Given the phased approach to developing the national curriculum, the extent of consultations undertaken in its development, and the need for flexibility in implementation, a legislative amendment is necessary to better accommodate this phased curriculum development and implementation process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, originally said in 2008, when she was the Minister for Education, that the curriculum would take three years to develop and be ready to implement by January 2011. The Prime Minister also claimed, before the last federal election, that one of her biggest achievements was delivering a national curriculum. She made statements prior to the federal election such as: 'This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' The truth is that after nearly four years of Labor the curriculum documents for the first stage of a national curriculum, years K to 10, in the areas of English, maths, science and history still remain in draft and have not been given final approval by each of the states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the well-documented bungling of a national curriculum the final version has not been approved by the ministerial council to date and most states will not even begin implementation until 2013 or 2014, so the original legislation needed changing. I also helpfully pointed out to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth earlier this year, when a one-year extension for the current funding arrangements for non-government schools was being considered by this parliament, that he would need to remove the requirement for non-government schools across Australia to implement the curriculum by January 2012. Much to my surprise he appeared to have missed that the 31 January deadline might have been a problem, or perhaps he was, as usual, asleep at the wheel. In an attempt to assist the minister for school education, the coalition sought to fix this for him and remove the 2012 start date, but he did not, inexplicably, support the coalition's amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously the coalition recognises that this needs changing. Schools cannot implement a curriculum that is simply not ready or is still in draft. For this reason we will not oppose the bill. Instead, the government has had to introduce a entire new bill to fix the curriculum oversight rather than simply addressing it earlier in the year by eating humble pie and supporting the coalition's amendment. We find ourselves debating this bill because the Labor government, one of the worst in our nation's history, is incapable of delivering anything on time or on budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schools need funding certainty, and for this reason we will not oppose the bill. Nevertheless, this bill has provided a further opportunity for considering how the government might be able to improve on existing arrangements related to the curriculum process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. Our concerns are not with the concept but, rather, the direction the curriculum is heading under Labor. I can assure you, Deputy Speaker Slipper, that these concerns are shared across the entire education sector. The Australian Curriculum Coalition recently wrote to me, the minister for school education and all state and territory education ministers outlining a number of concerns about the government's progress, or lack of progress. The government cannot possibly stand here today and suggest that the curriculum is going well. Please do not make us laugh with the claim that it is on schedule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Curriculum Coalition comprises 10 peak bodies from both the government and non-government sectors. It includes the Australian Association for Research in Education, the Australian College of Educators, the Australian Council for Educational Leaders, the Australian Curriculum Studies Association, the Australian Education Union, Lutheran Education Australia, the Australian Special Education Principals Association, the Australian Professional Teachers Association, the Australian Secondary Principals Association and the Independent Education Union of Australia—not a group that you would normally see gathering together to oppose a government measure. The statement opened by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Curriculum Coalition (ACC) believes that it is imperative at this midpoint in the development of the Australian Curriculum that thoughtful and considered deliberation be given to implementation of critical elements of the proposed curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It has become evident to members of the ACC that underpinning principles of the national curriculum have not been given adequate regard or sufficient resources committed to their development and that federal, state and territory governments are on the verge of endorsing a curriculum that does not meet the objective of the Australian government of: delivering a world class education system to ensure Australians are armed with the knowledge and skills to meet the demands of the 21st Century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The letter then goes on in detail to describe each of the activities that the ministerial council promised to address last year, when the draft curriculum was being considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Final approval was not given to the national curriculum, as was originally planned by the government last year, due to a number of deficiencies with it. But do not just take my word for it. I will read an extract of the council's communique from December last year to make my point here, because I have noticed that the minister for school education in recent interviews on this subject has been very misleading. The council wrote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So far from the curriculum being historically endorsed, as the minister for education would try to lead you to believe, what actually happened last year was that all ministers agreed that a whole lot more work needs to be done before the curriculum can even think of being approved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Have any of these issues been addressed nearly nine months later? Apparently not, according to the Australian Curriculum Coalition, and it will come as a shock to members of the House to discover that nine months later virtually nothing has been achieved. The Australian Curriculum Coalition made the observation:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, however, an example of at least one minister who has acted since the Australian Curriculum Coalition's scathing letter and does have the resolve to see these issues addressed. Just last week the Hon. Adrian Piccoli, the Minister for Education in New South Wales, announced the New South Wales state government's decision to delay the introduction of the new Australian curriculum by at least a year until 2014. He acted upon the expert advice provided by the New South Wales Board of Studies that the curriculum is not yet of a high enough standard to be introduced into New South Wales. He has also suggested that federal resources for teacher professional development are needed before the curriculum can be adequately rolled out in New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His decision has been met with widespread support from education stakeholders in New South Wales, including the NSW Teachers Federation—not know to be a friend of the coalition—and non-government school sector bodies in that state. Even the NSW Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, who has had much to say about the perceived inadequacies of the coalition over the years, has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in NSW. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state. There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation. Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Federal President of the Australian Education Union, Angelo Gavrielatos, while charming, is not known to be a supporter of the coalition's policies in education. Even he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We still have a series of concerns with respect to the development of the national curriculum … we're also seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the coalition and the Australian Education Union are on a unity ticket opposing the implementation of a national curriculum that is neither ready for nor married with the required resources to ensure that it can be introduced successfully. The Independent Education Union President, Chris Watt, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've been saying for a long time that getting the content right is important and it looks like we might be getting towards an end point, although teachers still have not seen the final documents …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It appears the only person who does not have any concern about the national curriculum process is the hapless Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If a national curriculum is to serve the learning needs of our children, the implementation process must not be hurried in the manner of the minister for school education's Home Insulation Program, or the Prime Minister's bungled schools hall program. This is just too important to get wrong. I would have thought the member for Kingston would have thought that it was time for the minister for school education to get a policy right rather than to get it in. The minister for school education was so determined to implement his pink batts program that he was prepared to do so without the necessary protections being in place for householders to ensure that they did not face burning ceilings or even the tragic deaths that eventuated out of the implementation of the minister for school's disastrous pink batts program. That program will live in infamy as one of the most unsuccessful programs in the history of this place since Federation, and yet again the minister for school education is doing the same thing with the national curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Experts agree that the content will overwhelm teachers with no funding or support for the necessary training for the rollout to succeed. And doesn't that sound familiar? They are the criticisms that the national electrical organisations made back when the minister for school education was the minister responsible for the pink batts program. They warned the minister that there was not sufficient implementation funding and that there was not sufficient training and of course we saw the tragic results that the minister for schools presided over. While he did not lose his scalp over his disastrous performance as a minister, it certainly contributed to the axing of the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, on that infamous day last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these reasons, and because we want to try to help the government in spite of its hopeless approach, the coalition will move two amendments. The first relates to the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian curriculum. That amendment states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 8 to 11), omit all the words from and including "require" to the end of subsection 22(1), substitute:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) require the relevant authority for the school or system to ensure that the school, or each school in the system, implements the national curriculum prescribed by the regulations in accordance with the regulations; and</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small"> (b) provide such funding as is necessary to ensure that each teacher in the school or system has received professional development in the implementation of the national curriculum in accordance with a nationally consistent professional development program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently there is no nationally agreed or consistent approach across jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving the support in the area of teacher professional learning to be able to implement the Australian Curriculum. This point was made by the Independent Schools Council of Australia's submission to the inquiry into this bill. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ISCA would like to highlight the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian Curriculum. Currently there is no agreed or consistent approach across or within jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving the support required to implement the Australian Curriculum, particularly in the area of teacher professional learning.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, Deputy Speaker D'Ath, you do not need to take my word for it that this issue is only relevant to non-government schools. Unions representing teachers in government schools in Queensland and South Australia, from where the member for Kingston comes—and, in fact, from where the member for Brisbane comes—have now added their voices to the concerns of New South Wales that the necessary training and support required to implement the curriculum are not in place. Perhaps the member for Kingston, having observed the redistributed boundaries for South Australia, now believes that she is so untouchable in her seat of Kingston that she no longer has to listen to government school teachers or government school principals or the parents of children in government schools.</span>

I have been advocating for a long time that there needs to be a clear national plan for teacher professional development and specific resources allocated by the government for this. The government's National Partnership for Teacher Quality, which provides funding for teacher support, is not explicit that funding is set aside for the purpose of supporting teachers with respect to the national curriculum.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have written to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth previously asking that he give consideration to representation on the standing council or on its advisory officials committee, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. I believe that having representation at this level would be beneficial to add an extra layer of consultation on a range of issues affecting the sector and this representation would be a valuable source of strategic advice for any government in the future. This would provide a formal mechanism by which the non-government schools sector could be adequately and appropriately consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time frames for the national curriculum.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">…that a significant number—one in three—students in Australia attend non-government schools, and that neither national non-government school peak body has any representation on the Ministerial Council of Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs, the body that governs the work of ACARA and thus the work on the Australian Curriculum.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having improved representation on the standing council's senior officials committee would add a safeguard that non-government schools would be adequately and appropriately consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time frames.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems unthinkable to me that with the number of parents who have chosen to send their children to non-government schools—namely, one in three—they are not represented on the appropriate bodies that make the decisions in relation to education in Australia. The member for Bass comes from the state where there has recently been a crisis of confidence in the education minister. The Greens leader tried to close dozens of schools until I made a trip through Tasmania highlighting the issue and drawing attention to the failures of the state education minister. He then, within days of my leaving Tasmania, reversed his position. I am glad to see that it is still possible to put political pressure on any kind of government to ensure that they reverse a bad decision. I am glad that the minister there, Nick McKim, listened to the concerns I highlighted during my trip through Tasmania by holding public rallies and backed down from a very bad decision. I went to the member for Bass's electorate in Launceston and spoke to non-government schools there. You would think it was an important enough issue for him to lobby the minister for school education in relation to the representation of non-government schools on a national body such as this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do realise that 'improved representation' could also mean something as straightforward as receiving agenda papers and draft minutes from either the standing council or the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. Nevertheless, my amendment, if adopted, would enable improved representation of non-government sector authorities on this body. If I were minister for school education, I would certainly take up the opportunity and be grateful to have representation by the non-government sector at this level. These two modest amendments would go a long way in alleviating some of the reoccurring concerns about the curriculum process and have been endorsed by non-government sector authorities, both the NCEC and the ISCA. The government need to act to address the concerns being raised over the curriculum processes. They need to act now and take action to prevent further delays to the curriculum.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence families across Australia are frustrated that there is still no national consistency of curriculum between the states after four years of Labor. And I know the member for Fadden has a particular interest in the defence families in his electorate and, as a former of the defence services, he knows full well the pressures that defence families are already under because of the strenuous lifestyle that they lead and the pressures and stresses under which they are placed. As the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth has pointed out there are 80,000 students that cross state borders through the period of a year. These students are depending on the minister for schools to start addressing some of the practical issues that are leading to the delay of a national curriculum in schools.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also read the House standing committee's report on the inquiry into this bill. I noted the committee's comment that this bill is uncontroversial. While I agree with this statement in part, in that non-government schools cannot possibly be expected to implement a curriculum in a mere six months time, the events that have led to this are most certainly not uncontroversial. Unless the minister for school education starts taking some serious remedial action to save the national curriculum, many people in the sector are beginning to doubt whether it is ever going to eventuate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the crossbenchers take some time to deliberate on the coalition's suggestions for improvement and consult with the non-government sectors, who have indicated to me that they support these simple and modest improvements. I have written to the crossbenchers on two occasions outlining my amendments and seeking their support. I would remind the crossbenchers that my previous amendment on the earlier bill, which did not receive majority support, would have removed the deadline from the legislation, alleviating the need for this new change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendments today are necessary as well and I hope they will receive support. I would remind the crossbenchers that, if I had been listened to previously by the government and by the crossbenchers, we would not be here listening to my speech today. Some members of the chamber might regard that as a silver lining. However, unfortunately, because of the ineptness of the minister for school education, we are here and I am needing to once again point out the inadequacies of a very weak minister, a minister who is like a pane of glass at cabinet meetings—you could look straight through him and nobody would even know he was there. Education is far too important to be in the hands of a minister who is a pane of glass and who has no influence at all on the decision-making process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also point out that even though in July he was putting out press releases attacking me as the shadow minister and claiming that the Computers in Schools program was on track for delivery this year—even though we had pointed out that the government would deliver 45 per cent of the program in six months, having delivered 55 per cent in three years—the decision had already been made by the government in June that they would not be able to meet the deadline. But nobody told the minister for school education. In June the government had already decided—as shown in leaked documents that were in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> last Thursday—that they would not meet the deadline for Computers in Schools this year and yet a month later the poor, old minister for school education was putting out a press release saying that it was on track and on schedule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that nobody tells him what is going on. That was his defence when he was the minister for pink batts program. He always used to have excuses—the tram got a flat tyre or 'The dog ate my homework'. The reality is that he is not up to being the minister for school education, and it is far too important. There are 3.6 million students in schools across Australia. They are relying on the minister for school education to get it right. God help them!</span>

                    <a href="9K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms GAMBARO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  I am very pleased to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 and to associate myself with the comments made by the member for Sturt. I am pleased to support the amendments to the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill. They are a very important step in rectifying the failings that we have seen in the proposed implementation time line of the national curriculum over the last three years, and I wholeheartedly support these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe in a system of education that is outcomes focused and a system that enables students to achieve their full potential as functioning members of our society. In the electorate of Brisbane we have over 40 schools and we are fortunate to have a plethora of choice in government, Catholic and independent education options for our children. For many years the non-government education providers, from All Hallows—my old school—to Gregory Terrace, St Margaret's, St James, St Rita's, Clayfield College and Brisbane boys and girls grammar schools, have provided a quality education and quality service to the children of the Brisbane electorate. I am very grateful for their contribution to this great state of Queensland through their combined years of dedicated service to the community. It was good to spend some time with the school community at St Finbarrs at the Marist hall yesterday for their annual fundraiser, which saw some 500 parents, supporters and sponsors attend. It was a great event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been watching the national curriculum with great interest, because every time I visit a school usually a teacher will pull me aside and wring their hands with horror and ask me what is going on. It can be as simple a question as to what is happening with the citizenship program that a number of schools participate in—and many of us see schools come to Canberra to visit us. They are quite horrified by what they are seeing in the curriculum. They ask me if the citizenship program will stay in the primary school sector, as they hear rumours going around that it will be moved to the high school level. They really do not know what is going on and they are very confused and frustrated. They have been watching this process with great frustration. That is why we are all looking with very keen interest at the national curriculum debate and why these particular amendments are very, very important, particularly for non-government schools in the Brisbane electorate and other parts of Australia. These non-government schools serve as an important avenue to provide choice and flexibility for parents on how their children are educated. If we are to accept a nationally prescribed curriculum, it is centrally important that the sector is allowed clear representation, particularly in decision-making processes for the future of the national curriculum. The curriculum is for everyone; the curriculum is for government and non-government schools. In the seat of Brisbane alone, the non-government sector and the other sectors have many hundreds of years of combined experience in teaching, learning and adjusting the way in which they instruct Australian children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is wrong of the government to think that they can design a national curriculum for the millions of Australian schoolchildren in a mere three years without the representation of non-government schools. This sector really deserves an opportunity to make a direct contribution to the national debate. I was a member of the previous Howard government, which had many proud educational reforms which led to the development of the national curriculum. It has been clear, however, that since 2007 the Rudd and Gillard governments have failed to listen to the key stakeholders, the stakeholders who are involved every single day in the important education of our children. A Labor government would happily take any opportunity to undermine the viability of non-government and independent school sectors in Australia, and it is just not acceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, with regard to the national curriculum, they must not ignore this important voice in the sector. The current curriculum itself stands as an ideologically-driven document that ignores the inescapable contribution of Australia's British heritage and Judeo-Christian traditions. It is important to recognise the contribution of Aboriginal history and our engagement with Asia as integral to the multicultural success of Australia's development. However, with reference to the religious institutions that I have mentioned today and their important history in religious instruction, we must also place a greater importance than we currently see regarding the influence of Judeo-Christian values in Australia, both directly and indirectly. As I mentioned earlier, choice and flexibility is absolutely important; however, they are lacking in the current curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During my time as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence—and I notice we have the shadow minister sitting at the table today—a number of defence families, particularly of the Defence Families Association, constantly highlighted to me the inadequacy of the system that saw schoolchildren unable to continue a uniform education across state boundaries and, as the member for Sturt mentioned earlier, there are some 80,000 students that cross state boundaries every year, whether they are children of defence families or doing so through interstate relocations of their families. Labor has managed to create an overly prescriptive and overloaded mess, rather than providing a clear national program that serves as a framework for the success of Australia's next generations. It burdens our schools with mandatory hours in the areas of English, mathematics, science and history. I understand the importance of these four areas, as they are absolutely fundamental in life, but the curriculum does not strike a proper balance and does not recognise the diversity of students or the diversity of interest. This lack of balance reduces the amount of time allowed to teach other areas of interest, thereby reducing the ability of schools to differentiate themselves and to provide that really important choice and flexibility in the eyes of the parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current government has failed to listen to key stakeholders, including the NSW Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, who has made it quite clear that there are significant concerns in the community with regard to support that will be provided to teachers when the curriculum is finally implemented. The coalition has been listening and has listened to three stakeholders, the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union, which have endorsed the coalition's amendments. Schools across different state jurisdictions will not be able to adapt to the new curriculum overnight, and while I understand members on the opposite side of the House have had difficulty in recent years—particularly in rolling out any programs, including national programs—it is nevertheless difficult to understand how the government has not been able to recognise the support required to implement the national curriculum in our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to have an efficient but timely implementation that is of benefit to all students in Australia, the government must dedicate resources to provide professional development for teachers in both government and non-government schools. We need a high-quality core curriculum for all schools which is relevant, realistic, achievable and measurable, and where competency in numeracy and literacy are basic requirements. That is why I support the amendments proposed by the member for Sturt.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. As we know, education is the greatest opportunity for people of all ages. However, fundamentally, it provides the basic groundwork for a productive, challenging but happy future for our young people. One of the major changes to school education is the move towards a national curriculum. We on our side reflect the concerns of stakeholders at the direction that the curriculum is heading in under the Labor government, a government that is noted for its serial incompetence in delivering policies and projects in a well managed, cost-effective and efficient process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In education alone, we have seen repeated mismanagement, be it Computers in Schools or the wasted millions of taxpayers' funds in the BER program. Then there was the discrimination we saw with youth allowance and the uncertainty around school chaplaincy. This legislation gives us even more reason to be concerned. For instance, the Prime Minister originally said back in 2008 that the curriculum would take three years to develop and would therefore be ready to implement by January 2011. Well, that has come and gone. In 2010, the Prime Minister claimed:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">… the nation has been talking about having a National Curriculum for … 30 years …</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and claimed she had delivered it. But the national curriculum has not been delivered. For example, the bill before the House states that non-government schools are required to implement the national curriculum by 31 January 2012—certainly a long way from the Prime Minister's claim that she delivered a national curriculum in 2010. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister has made an art form of saying one thing and doing another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most serious issues with this legislation is the failure of the government to consult and respond to key stakeholders, though you would have thought that would have been integral to managing a national curriculum—for example, the Australian Curriculum Coalition, an organisation that represents teachers, principals, school leaders, academics and education researchers. This group believes that Australian schools, their teachers and their students deserve the highest quality national curriculum, and that is what they are asking for from this government. That is a very noble and worthy intent, and I support them in that. Matters raised by the ACC mostly remain unresolved, and the ACC believes there is a lot of work that still needs to be done in relation to a national, common approach to achievement standards. There is the additional material that is needed by states and territories to support effective implementation of the curriculum to accommodate different curriculum development approval and implementation requirements; the need for a clear overarching framework; the development of curriculum content and achievement standards as required to meet the needs of special-needs students; and engagement with teachers in the implementation process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are basic, core requirements that the ACC has asked of the government in rolling out a national curriculum. It is this group that knows how it needs to work on the ground—how it has to work with administrators, teachers and students in the actual schools. This is just another demonstration of how the Labor government is bungling yet another program. This final version of the national curriculum has not engaged key stakeholders—and, according to its current form, most states are not estimated to begin implementation until 2013-14.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are moving two further sensible amendments, noting that Labor ignored our amendments to the previous bill back in March. I should also highlight the endorsement of these amendments by the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union—important bodies in any discussion about education in this nation. The first amendment moved by the coalition will ensure that schools are equipped with the support and assistance they required to implement the national curriculum. This is a sensible amendment and something that is badly needed by the schools. This amendment arose from the coalition's concerns about the current lack of a nationally agreed or consistent approach across jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving support in the area of teacher professional learning to enable them to implement the Australian curriculum. The second amendment we will be moving seeks to include a clear representation of the non-government school sector with regard to the decision-making process for future time lines of the national curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have a number of specific concerns with this legislation, including the insufficient representation of the non-government school sector on the relevant subcommittee reporting to the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs. We also have concerns that the curriculum is overcrowded and does not provide enough scope to recognise the diversity of students, including gifted and talented students. There are a wide range of students out there, with varying levels of need, and we need a curriculum that encompasses those needs. Our concerns extend to the manner in which the national curriculum documents are being produced and the content of these documents, not to mention the lack of stakeholder consultation and the lack of clarity around whether the material is meant to be mandatory or is designed to be a code around which jurisdictions and schools may add a local flavour. I would question whether those who will be producing this material, those in the printing and content sector, have even been consulted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition support a national curriculum in principle, but we do have major concerns about the direction in which the current curriculum is heading under the Labor government. The bill is evidence of the Labor government's routine of rushing policy through before thinking about the details and the practicalities—how it will be delivered, how it will work on the ground. None of those issues have been addressed in this legislation. As I said, there is a pattern of not being able to deliver these policies on the ground, where they matter.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, I believe that school education is of the utmost importance as it provides the grounds for a great future for our young people, but it does not appear that the Labor government is focused on delivering that through this legislation. I have previously raised in this House a number of the inequities the government created with youth allowance. We have seen a whole raft of different proposals by this government in relation to a range of education legislation, and it certainly has not delivered. I am hoping the inquiry by Professor Kwong Lee Dow will deliver some equity for students who were defined as living in inner regional areas. There are 10 sitting days left in which to table the report in each house of parliament. Given that sittings have resumed, I urge the minister to table the report immediately, to give students in inner regional areas who have been left in limbo some indication of what their future may hold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all part of the education package that this government is failing to deliver in a way that is practical and sensible and that delivers on the ground, where it needs to, particularly in rural and regional Australia. We are determined to ensure that students in these areas are given the financial support they need and deserve, in the same way that we are determined to ensure that, through a national curriculum, students, teachers and all those who are engaged in the delivery of the curriculum have the resources they need. That is why we are making these particular amendments to this bill. They need and deserve the level of support that we are recommending through our amendments. In conclusion, I believe that people in Australia should have access to lifetime learning regardless of where they live. I support the amendments by the member for Sturt, but there are a number of concerns. I look around my electorate and see that any number of schools are affected by the national curriculum. Every school will be affected by it. I walk into their classrooms, I walk into their environments and each one of them has special needs in a different sense because they cater for a different cross-section of students. Some of them might have anything from 10 to 15 different languages spoken in their school and they have particular needs to deliver a national curriculum for students in that environment. But the teachers also have needs, and there is the need for resources. That is the basis for the amendments that we are proposing for this bill. I support the amendments by the member for Sturt and the coalition as very sensible. I encourage the government to take up these amendments. It is important that, in rolling out a national curriculum, all of the supports that are necessary to enable this to work in the schools where it is intended actually have the effect that is intended.</span>

                    <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, a bill which amends the Schools Assistance Act. The substance of this bill is quite straightforward: it amends the requirement, which presently exists under law, that non-government schools must implement the national curriculum by 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is such an amendment necessary? Sadly, it is because we have once again seen from this government a demonstration that there is a vast gulf between its lofty ideals and frequently stated ambitions and what it actually manages to implement by stated deadlines. Let's be clear: this bill is not about whether the national curriculum is a good idea in principle. The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. We do not have concerns with the broad concept but we have significant concerns with the direction in which the national curriculum is heading under the Gillard Labor government, and amongst our concerns are the consequences of the national curriculum—and the way it is being amended—for the independent schools sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the brief time available to me, I want to make three key points. Firstly, the national curriculum process is a mess. The date, which is supposed to be met, keeps failing to be met, and overall the government is having great difficulty in achieving its targets. The second point I want to make is that the process which is being carried on and, indeed, the legislative framework are incidentally quite revealing of the underlying hostility of the Labor Party to the independent school sector. The third point is that the amendments which we have proposed seek to redress the balance and give independent schools a fair go and fair representation in the national curriculum process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to the first proposition which I wish to advance, which is that the national curriculum process is in a mess. It is, you may think, a surprising proposition that a process being managed by a national government should be disorganised and failing to meet the stated time lines. Sadly, as with so many other aspects of the Rudd-Gillard government's poor track record of administration and implementation, when it comes to the national curriculum, we are seeing the very same level of poor performance, poor implementation and a yawning gulf between what is promised, what is claimed and what is actually delivered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me join my coalition colleagues in once again reminding the chamber of the commitment of the claim made on 15 April 2008 by the then minister for education—before she achieved her glittering and sudden ascent—when she said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me again join with my coalition colleagues in making the point: it has not yet been delivered. It is a statement of aspiration. The performance does not match the rhetoric, and we see this so often from this government. Who could forget the tearful farewell from the former Prime Minister listing a series of accomplishments, which so many times fell short of the claims that he made? Or I could note the recent claim by the Prime Minister in another field, telecommunications, where she is now claiming to have delivered the structural separation of Telstra. Let me assure the Prime Minister: Telstra is not structurally separated; it remains a dominant and vertically integrated company. In field after field of which, tragically, the national curriculum is one, we see this yawning gulf between the stated aspirations of this government and the sad track record of underachievement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current legislation, the act as it presently stands, the Schools Assistance Act, provides that non-government schools were to implement the national curriculum by January 31 2012. Against this target, it is timely to ask: what progress has been achieved to date? Phase 1, the draft kindergarten to year 10 curriculum for English, maths, science and history has been drafted by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority and a final draft will be presented to education ministers in October this year. Phase 2, covering the learning areas of languages, geography and the arts, is still under development; and a phase 3 will be required to cover the remaining learning areas identified in the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians. The curriculum for senior secondary years is one where work is only just beginning. It is quite likely that the development of a national curriculum for these years will require a very significant period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The clear reality is that the national curriculum is nowhere near ready for implementation by 31 January 2012. What did the New South Wales Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, have to say about this? He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might add that that is a sentiment which I have had put to me by teachers in both non-government and government schools in my electorate of Bradfield, including, for example, senior maths teachers at Normanhurst Boys High School, amongst many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the House was advised earlier today, in an attempt to assist the government in dealing with this looming administrative problem, the shadow minister for education, apprenticeships and training proposed an amendment in March this year, but at that time the government minister seemed unaware of the problem and failed to support the coalition's amendment.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FLETCHER:</span>
                    </a>  It has been put to me that this is a minister who does not have a tremendous track record of implementation himself, as the owners of a number of houses which now lie in smouldering ruins could ruefully testify. So it is perhaps no great surprise that the notion of preparing and being ready to implement a program by the stated date of 31 January 2012 was not something that the minister and member for Kingsford Smith, for the moment, was able to do. I am shocked at the implication that a familiarity with project management and even Gantt charts were possibly not within his previous experience as a leading Australian pop music star, but that is another matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to the next proposition I want to put to the House, which is that this process and this legislation reveal the underlying hostility of the Labor Party to the independent school sector. The financial impact of this bill, stated in the explanatory memorandum, makes this point very clear. It highlights that the amount of funding provided to non-government schools under the Schools Assistance Act is $8.1 billion for 2012-13, $8.8 billion for the next year and $9.5 billion for the third year. These are substantial figures and the Labor government is clearly proposing to apply a very blunt instrument whereby, if non-government schools are not able to meet the prescribed time frames, their funding is at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be absolutely clear: the coalition are very strong supporters of both independent schools and government schools. In my own electorate of Bradfield, we are privileged to have an outstanding group of independent schools, an outstanding group of Catholic schools and an outstanding group of government schools. I am enormously and repeatedly impressed by the work and commitment of the teachers, parents and other stakeholders in these fine institutions. I make this point: on this side of the House we recognise the synergy in education policy between having a strong independent school sector and having a strong government school sector, because we recognise, as some seem not to, that independent schools take pressure off the government school system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, therefore, are very concerned that the Labor government has not made adequate provision for non-government schools to have their say regarding the national curriculum on matters such as implementation and timing, because non-government schools have not been provided with any representation on the appropriate government bodies. There is no specific non-government school representation on the standing council, nor is there any such representation on the committee of its advisory officials, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Et cetera, et cetera—you can see the excuses forming here. But we make the point that a consultation process must adequately take account of the views of all stakeholders, and the governance processes must adequately make representation for all stakeholders. We also note that non-government school sector representatives told the House Standing Committee on Education and Employment's inquiry into the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 that they believe that the issue of appropriate representation on the Senior Officials Committee is becoming ever more significant given the expanding and developing role of the committee. Therefore, if adopted, the coalition's amendment would provide the government with an option to provide non-government school sector authorities with observer status on the Senior Officials Committee, either instead of or in addition to membership, and this could in practical terms allow non-government school sector authorities to receive agenda and briefing papers for both the ministerial standing council and the Senior Officials Committee in advance as well as draft minutes in retrospect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some may say that this is a modest amendment; we do not agree. We think it is an important improvement to the process which would give adequate representation to the interests of the independent school sector in what is a very important reform process which applies to every school across Australia—government schools, Catholic schools and independent schools. I have argued today that the process has not achieved administrative excellence; instead it would undoubtedly be said of the government, if it were being given a report card by one of the many excellent teachers in any one of the many excellent schools around Australia, 'must try harder—has good intentions but does not always finish his or her work', because that is the position that the government is in at the moment with the national curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter for regret that the poor administration of the national curriculum by this government makes the bill necessary. On this side of the House we have made it clear that we support the substance of the bill, but we certainly do not support not giving independent schools an appropriate voice in the curriculum process.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I rise to support the amendments moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, the Shadow Minister for Education, Apprenticeships and Training, the member for Sturt. In doing so I follow a very high-quality contribution from the member for Bradfield, who is keeping up the usual standard of his contributions in this place. He spoke thoughtfully about some very important concerns—the standard of education in our country and the direction that it is taking and the way the government is plans to implement the national curriculum through the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011—that are close to the hearts of many of us in this place. The member for Bradfield summed up our concerns very well in his contribution, so I do not intend to go through them in the same detail as he did. They were also placed on the record very well by the shadow minister earlier today. But I do want to touch on a couple of the issues raised and how they relate to my electorate of Mayo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of us in this place understand the importance of a high-quality education. The Liberal Party has pursued policies which are about achieving standards in education for some time now. We take the view that government should try to encourage the education sector, whether it be the government sector, the Catholic sector or the independent sector, to produce students with the highest possible education standards so that they can meet the demands of industry for jobs and go off to university, if it suits them, and get a higher level of education so that they have an opportunity to create their own prosperity and improve their standard of living and the national well-being at the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, standards in schools are very important in what a national curriculum sets out, and I am supporter of a standardised approach across the country so that there is some consistency. I think, though, that we have to be very careful that we do not take away from a competitive approach across the different streams and get to the point where people are being dictated to about what they can and cannot teach in their schools—there needs to be some flexibility in government's approach to the matter. The argument that the voices of non-government schools in this debate need to be heard more loudly is a very important part of the second amendment that the member for Sturt is pursuing, because there is a concern amongst parents' groups at non-government schools in my electorate that there is a pursuit by some of a political agenda through education.</span>
                </p>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BRIGGS:</span>
                    </a>  The member for Bass over there seems to be having some entertainment at his own expense. There is a concern that, during the early stages of its drafting, the standard national curriculum has been turned into a way to indoctrinate kids in certain philosophies rather than used to give them an opportunity to get the broader education that we on this side of the House believe will ensure that they are best prepared for future opportunities within our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment that the member for Sturt proposes will be an important step in ensuring not only that the process is kept on track—because, as the member for Bradfield observed, the minister in charge of this process has not been labelled particularly confident in his career thus far as a minister, and keeping him under watch in the implementation of the curriculum is quite an important thing to do—but also that what comes out of the drafting of the curriculum is of good quality. That is very important to those of us in this room who are going through the education journey with our own children. Parents take a great deal of interest in how their children are being taught and what they are being taught, so parents are actively engaged in and raise issues about the quality of education and the restrictions that some would like to place on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are members of the Labor-Green coalition government who are against the independent sector. They do not believe that the independent sector should be funded to the extent that it is, and by stealth they would like to have both the Catholic independent sectors defunded to a significant degree. There are also concerns about where the national curriculum is going, and we should be very conscious of that, because independent schools and Catholic schools provide choice for parents who want to have a values based education as well as an educational standard for their children. I know there are some in this chamber who have benefited greatly from that independent stream in their upbringing. They might have been misguided in some of the ways they went about their education and future careers from that opportunity, but they still benefited enormously from the opportunities the independent stream gave. In that respect I think people will recognise that the independent and Catholic sectors do provide those choices for parents that they should be able to provide. There are some concerns about using this national curriculum to constrain the direction that some schools would like to take in their teaching.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, has proposed are good amendments, and I am sure they are amendments that the government will support because they bring a couple of issues to bear which have not been thought out by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. I know there will be some concern on the government side that the minister in charge has probably missed a couple of these points on the way through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first amendment as drafted gives additional support to the rollout of the national curriculum. It is an issue which has been raised extensively by members of the opposition, and the shadow minister has articulated a need for that change quite well. I think this is an amendment that makes much sense. We have had all sorts of claim of credit for the national curriculum being rolled out successfully: so far we have had the Prime Minister say during the election campaign:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, so far we have not seen it delivered. As the member for Bradfield outlined it will not meet the 31 January 2012 deadline, so there need to be some changes made to the time lines that the government has set for itself. It is another failed delivery of a promise that it has built up. Ultimately, more than anything else, the detail of this national curriculum needs to be right; it needs to ensure it has heard all the voices and that it is not written in a prescriptive manner that is about pursuing a politically ideological agenda. It needs to be about ensuring that children come out with the best standard of education that they possibly can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the Liberal Party has for some time had a strong commitment to standards in education. Back in the 2004 election campaign we famously had the simple, plain English report card that Brendan Nelson, who was the minister for education at that point, pursued quite heavily. It was good policy and it was good politics because parents wanted information about how their children were performing and they wanted it in a simple fashion. They wanted to be told how their children were achieving and how their children were going at school in a way the parents understood so that they were part of the education journey with their children. It is ultimately a very important aspect of education that the parents are engaged and are part of the education journey along with the school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this gets back to a concern that some have that the curriculum being pursued is to be very specific and focused on a political perspective rather than on a broader education. In that respect, I note that the IPA, the Institute of Public Affairs, has raised some concerns about the direction of some of the early drafting of the curriculum regarding a very heavy focus on Indigenous and Asian culture, without similar weight being given to our British heritage, our Western values or our Judeo-Christian traditions, which are so important to the fabric of our society and the fundamentals of where we have come from and where we will continue to go. This is an important aspect which has been forgotten. In their contribution the IPA has raised some very important points, which should be considered as a reason for increasing the size of the committee to have that non-government voice as part of this consideration in the first place. So there is a broader consideration that the voices of the 30 or 40 per cent of parents who choose to go through the non-government Catholic education sector are heard in these deliberations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, we want a national standard across the education field. We want to ensure that the differences in the standards of education between states are reduced as much as possible. But I do not think we want to standardise completely the opportunities for schools to exercise their ability to teach, and to achieve the standards they wish to achieve, in their own special way and through their own special contribution. In that respect we support the objects of the bill, but we think there are a couple of points where we can improve it. We hope that the government will see the wisdom in following our two proposed amendments. They are good amendments which will improve this bill and ensure that this minister, who we know so far has not had a glittering career of delivering policy, does not do the same to our education system as he did to pink batts.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  The coalition supports the national curriculum in principle. It is a good idea. It is necessary. Many people in my Riverina electorate have told me how confusing and frustrating it is when they move from or to another state and there is inconsistency with what is being taught and at what year level. This is particularly prevalent for children of transient workers such as those who work in some agricultural pursuits, who follow the picking seasons, and also those in military families who frequently move from base to base. As a tri-service defence city, Wagga Wagga has many people who fall into the latter category. For them, a national curriculum would be welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's concerns regarding the national curriculum are not with the concept but rather its direction under Labor. When the Prime Minister was Minister for Education in 2008 she said a national curriculum would take three years to develop and be ready to implement by January 2011. Under the current legislation, non-government schools are required to put the national curriculum into place by 31 January 2012. As with anything Labor touches, the whole thing has been mucked up. Just like the rapscallion schoolboy who tells the teacher a dog ate his homework, the current Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth also gets an F for failing to deliver on Labor's commitment. The final version of the national curriculum is yet to be approved, and most states will not introduce it until 2013 or 2014. The original legislation therefore needed adjusting. The coalition sought to make the necessary amendments back in March, but the minister was apparently unaware that this presented a problem and did not support our amendment. Schools cannot put in place a curriculum which is not ready—not anywhere near ready. This bill is proof positive that Labor has not delivered on its commitment. During last year's election campaign the Prime Minister claimed, obviously falsely, that the national curriculum was finished. She made statements such as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When, Prime Minister?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's amendments have now been endorsed by the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union. The coalition noted advice from non-government school sector authorities to the House inquiry into the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 that the issue of appropriate representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee is becoming increasingly important given the emerging task of the committee. This is especially so relating to the national curriculum. If adopted, the coalition's amendment would provide the government with an opportunity to provide non-government sector authorities with 'observer status' on the AEEYSOC instead of or in addition to membership. This could permit, for instance, non-government sector authorities to receive agenda and briefing papers for both the standing council and AEEYSOC in advance, as well as draft minutes in retrospect. We hope the government will adopt this necessary and reasonable amendment to enable non-government sector authorities to make much more informed and better targeted contributions to the national debate. Further, it would ensure that they would be appropriately consulted regarding time lines for introduction of the national curriculum. This is wholly appropriate. This amendment is significant given that the number of parents who have chosen to send their children to non-government schools are not represented on the appropriate bodies which make the decisions in relation to education in this nation. This is unfair and needs to be altered. The coalition amendment also provides for a broad, appropriate teacher development strategy for the national curriculum. Although this bill relates only to non-government schools, we also advocate that professional development to teachers should be available across the whole schools sector.</span>

The coalition is deeply concerned about some of the ideological undertones which are pervading the curriculum. The coalition is deeply concerned about the overly prescriptive nature of the draft document. Experts in education agree the content will swamp teachers, with no funding or backup for the required training for the rollout to succeed. These fears are shared by key stakeholder groups, including teacher representatives and professional associations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, the coalition has moved two vital amendments. Firstly, schools will need to be provided with the appropriate level of assistance and support to introduce an Australian curriculum. Secondly, we seek to include clear representation of the non-government school sector in the decision-making processes for future time lines of a national curriculum. Presently there is no national or consistent approach to making sure all schools are getting the support they so desperately need in teacher professional learning to be able to implement an Australian curriculum. Having adequate representation adds a safeguard that non-government schools would be properly consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time lines. These two modest amendments will certainly help smooth this challenging reform process and bring some level of fairness to the debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Prime Minister to say that she has already delivered a national curriculum is a case of her getting ahead of herself—way ahead of herself. New South Wales Teachers Federation President Bob Lipscombe said only recently, on 10 August: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in NSW. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state … There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate."</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we know that the decision to delay the new curriculum has irked the education minister. He accused New South Wales of 'letting students down' and walking away from its commitment. 'There is no justifiable reason for this 11th-hour backdown,' the minister said.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this issue is the cost of getting teachers ready for the new curriculum. The New South Wales Minister for Education, Adrian Piccoli, said it would cost about $80 million over four years to implement the curriculum and to provide professional development of teachers. If Mr Piccoli said New South Wales is unwilling to run with the national curriculum agenda because federal Labor has not done due diligence on funding and support then that would be correct. The New South Wales education minister is the member for Murrumbidgee, much of which is in the federal seat of Riverina. He was a competent shadow education, skills and youth affairs spokesman from 28 December 2008 right through the dying days—excuse me—</span>

Recently, the Director of Schools in the Catholic Education Office, Wagga Wagga, Mr Alan Bowyer, was moved to respond in a media statement to concerns that funding would be cut and media reports that funding would be cut by this Labor-Greens alliance. The statement reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In responding to enquiries from a number of media representatives, Mr Bowyer declared, "We believe that a fair, equitable and certain funding scheme for <span style="font-weight:bold;">all</span> schools is vital for the continued growth and expansion of quality learning and teaching for all Australian students and teachers".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is something I am sure all people in this place would agree with. It continues:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Our belief is that education is a basic entitlement and all students, whether they attend a Catholic, an independent or a state school, have the right to be funded by government at a level that provides a balanced, rigorous and properly resourced education", Mr Bowyer said. "No parent should be financially penalised as a result of choosing to send their children to Catholic schools in accordance with their religious beliefs and commitment to the Church".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Bowyer stated that figures taken from the National Report on Schooling in Australia (2008) clearly indicate that Catholic schools and non-government schools in general, are under-funded when compared with state schools. "While a student in a state school, on average, in 2007-08 received $12,639 in funding from state and federal governments for the year, the figure for a Catholic school student was only $7,685. Productivity Commission figures in 2009 show that the amount for public school students was a little less – $11,874 per student while the amount per child in the independent sector remained steady", he said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"School funding is a complex issue. State governments are the primary source of recurrent funding for schools and provide approximately 93% of public school costs but only about 17% of non-government schools costs. The Federal government provides top up assistance of approximately 7% to public schools and about 53% to non-government schools resulting in the need for non-government schools to charge school fees to address the gap. Catholic systemic schools endeavour to keep school fees as low as possible to ensure Catholic education is affordable for families, but school fees as such, only partly contribute to the funding gap between what is received from government sources and the true costs of schooling …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Bowyer went on to reveal that 704,000 (20%) students attend Catholic schools across Australia, and stated that these schools employ 78,000 staff. He said that in 2010 in NSW, 66 per cent of students attended public schools, 22 per cent of students went to Catholic schools and 12 per cent attended independent schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"It should be remembered that many Catholic schools, which dominate the non-government school sector in terms of enrolments, serve disadvantaged communities made up of migrant and working-class families and those living in remote and rural Australia", Mr Bowyer said. "In some areas, the Catholic school is the only school serving the local community".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Bowyer welcomed the opportunity that organisations had to make submissions to the Gonski Review and said he was reassured by the Prime Minister's promise that, "this is not about taking money away from schools" and that "no school will lose a dollar of funding, in the sense that their school budget per student will not reduce in dollar terms".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly do hope that the Prime Minister lives up to those words; I certainly do hope that Labor does not listen to the Greens and cut or freeze Catholic school funding, because it is all about choice, and in Australia we should have that choice. If a parent wants to send their child to a Catholic school they should be able to do so, with the knowledge that that schoolchild will be funded properly and sufficiently so that they receive a good and fair education. There should be fair and equitable funding right across the school education system.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  In rising to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill, I am reminded of the purpose behind our education system. Regardless of how we build the system and how we operate the system, the desired outcome remains the same—to help future generations to learn. Following the member for Riverina's comments, I want to endorse some of the remarks he made at the end of his contribution with regard to Catholic and private schools. I have always been of the belief that taxpayer funds are for the children, for the students, and it really should not matter which school they attend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every bill that comes before this parliament should, in some way, enhance education and learning outcomes for future generations—and I am talking about all students here. I believe the coalition's amendments to this bill will do that. But we cannot expect our children to learn if the system's builders and operators demonstrate a fundamental inability to learn, if they are unable to learn the easiest lessons of all—and that is learning from one's own mistakes. Such a flaw would undermine the system. It would undermine the outcomes. It would deliver for future generations a standard lower than they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have in the bill before us is a warning that the current government is simply not capable of learning from its own mistakes. It is not for the want of opportunity. They have created more than their fair share of learning opportunities—or mistakes. Amongst an extensive back catalogue of these learning opportunities, we find familiar themes. There are common threads. These threads suggest that, if only a small number of lessons could be learnt by the government, a large number of future stuff-ups could be avoided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The troubling thing is this. We can see the problems coming. We can see that the national curriculum and how it is going to be implemented have not been properly thought through. We know what happens as a result, because we have seen it happen one too many times during this current government. It is troubling because we can see it coming but the government cannot. It is like being a passenger in a car doing 200 kilometres an hour who can see the approaching cliff when the driver is too busy looking in the vanity mirror.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is troubling because we can see yet another knee-jerk reaction in the pipeline. We can see a government going off half-cocked because they are so desperate to make it look as if they have actually done something. They are so desperate, in fact, that they do not even wait until the job is half done before claiming that it is finished. With this Schools Assistance Amendment Bill in mind I might remind the House that the Prime Minister said on 2 July last year: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was more than a year ago. There has still been nothing delivered, and that is why we are here debating this bill almost 14 months later, and implementation is still a speck on the future horizon. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to its concerns about delayed delivery the coalition also has serious concerns about exactly what is being delivered and how it is going to be delivered. That is why we have moved important amendments—amendments that we hope can stop this runaway car before it reaches the cliff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need the government not only to allow input from the appropriate sources but to listen to that input—to take in advice and admit to themselves that people and organisations outside the Labor Party and the Greens, people working in the education system and with the education system, might actually know what they are talking about. Because what this government thinks it is going to deliver as a national curriculum is nothing to skite about; it is something that should be cause for deep embarrassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition believes that a delay in implementation is necessary. That is why we have sought previously to pass a similar bill. A delay in implementation of the national curriculum is necessary because it could be a very, very long time before this government could get the national curriculum right. The implementation of this national curriculum has all the loose threads—all the warning signs, all the hallmarks—of the multitude of miserable failures this government should have learned from. This government should have learned that what happens when you make promises you are not capable of delivering is something like the failed computers in schools program. There is a strong parallel between the Prime Minister claiming a year ago that she had delivered a national curriculum and the promise that computers would be delivered to every high school student by the end of 2011. In June this year, only 55 per cent of the computers had been rolled out, and that has taken three years to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Mr McCormack interjecting</span>—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CHRISTENSEN:</span>
                    </a>  That leaves the government another six months to roll out the remaining 45 per cent which, the member for Riverina reminds me, is missing. But that was never going to happen. Even the education department knew that was not going to happen. The only problem is, they never told the minister for education that it was not going to happen, because a month later the minister was still telling us the program was on track and on schedule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a proven track record of inability to deliver. But here they are, bragging about having delivered a national curriculum that is still miles away from completion. The government should have learned that what happens when you do not fully think things through is that you end up with a debacle like the overpriced school halls that picked the pockets of Australian taxpayers and ripped off state government schools. Did anyone ever sit down and think about how these school halls would be delivered, who would build them, how they would build them, how they would price them and how fair value would be measured? The result was a disastrous waste of money—money that should have created much greater benefit for our education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here they are, skiting about having delivered a national curriculum when there is still no real plan as to how it is going to be delivered. The government should have learned that what happens when you do not consider the implications of a shoddy implementation plan is a pink batts scheme. If you create an environment where people are not properly trained for what they are supposed to do, not given clear guidelines on how to perform their task and not given the support they need to do their job, you have to expect a degree of failure. That should be a lesson learned from the pink batts program. But here we are, putting together a national curriculum content that will leave teachers ill-equipped for implementation. They will be overwhelmed with the size and scope of the task. There is inadequate provision for training and support and there is a distinct lack of clear guidelines to follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should have learned that what happens when you are led down the garden path by a minority interest is that you lose sight of the big picture. You end up pandering to a single entity with a minority view point. You end up pushing pokies legislation that is hated by millions of people just to garner the support of a single person. But here we are, creating content that is so ideologically skewed that it pushes every cultural context except reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national curriculum in its current format goes to great lengths to add weight to minority views, Indigenous culture and Asian culture without equal weight for the dominant British heritage and Judaeo-Christian traditions on which this country was founded. I am not opposed to including such content in the curriculum. Indigenous culture is a very important component of modern Australian culture. Our country's geographical ties to Asia also need to be recognised, but these influences must be viewed, as they are in the real world, through the framework of our overwhelmingly British heritage and dominant Judaeo-Christian traditions. These are the foundations of Australian society. They are the foundations of the world our children live in. They are the foundations that have built our language—the language that our teachers will be using to educate our children. To ignore these foundations would be no less a failure than to completely ignore Indigenous and Asian culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These concerns about the content of the national curriculum are concerns held not just by the coalition; they are views shared by key stakeholders. Dr Kevin Donnelly, the director of the Melbourne based Education Standards Institute, said that he too could see this coming. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I can see that my fears about the new curriculum were well founded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He described the content as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a heady mixture of politically correct perspectives: sustainable, indigenous, feminist, class, postmodern and cultural relativist. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He shares the view that it is only through the context of our Western heritage that we can understand our legal system, our political system, our language, our literature and our education. We have to question why someone would sit down and develop a national curriculum that goes to great lengths to ignore the terms BC and AD to indicate years simply because BC stands for 'Before Christ'. We must not mention the C-word. No, they thought it would be better to use the term BCE: 'Before common era'. That is rewriting history at its best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not content with rewriting history, this government is supporting a national curriculum that gives a fantastic outline of the Labor Party but conveniently neglects to balance the outlines of the Liberal and National parties. That is serious. That is in the national curriculum. Perhaps if the people on the ground were given the opportunity for input and the government took the time to put its ego in a box long enough to listen to what the people were saying it would avoid such embarrassment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should have learnt. They still are not listening to what people are saying about the carbon tax and it just makes people angrier—and we saw it today. It makes people more determined to force an election by any means possible. They need to avoid that personality flaw here and allow for more voices into the national curriculum formulation. In the time afforded by the extension of this deadline, the government should accept their own shortcomings and actively seek advice from those who really do know better. Including a representative from the non-government schools on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee would be a very good start, because so much of the future depends on our education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lives of generations to come will be hugely shaped by the education that we provide now for our young people. It is of great concern to me that such an important part of our society is now in the hands of this government, Labor and the Greens, who clearly demonstrate that they are most incapable of learning themselves. I really do hope that this curriculum is delayed so that we can have some balance and we can get it right, because if we do not get this right it will not be the government that suffers but the children—that is, until we reach the ballot box.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in New South Wales. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Lipscombe said that on the ABC news on 10 August 2011. He spoke not only for New South Wales but also for the states and territories of the Commonwealth because sadly, as we stand here this evening debating the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, we see that the national curriculum is not ready to be implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. We are not concerned with the idea. We are sadly concerned, though, once again with how it is being implemented by the Gillard government. This dates back to 2008 when Julia Gillard, our current Prime Minister, said it would take three years to develop and implement. That was in 2008—three years ago—and it would be ready to go by January 2011. If I am not mistaken, it is now August 2011 and here we are debating this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is ironic that the coalition sought to amend the legislation when it was initially put so that we could look at a start date of 2013 or 2014 and the government would not allow our amendment, yet here we are having to look at either a 2013 or a 2014 start date. It shows that, once again, this government is lacking when it comes to implementation. Although it has been quoted by pretty much every speaker that has been before me on our side, it is worth reminding the House what the Prime Minister said during the election campaign: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I've delivered it.' Sadly, she has not and it is going to take some time yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is to be delivered in a way that is meaningful and does the right thing by schools in this country, it is going to need some change. That is why, in a very positive and bipartisan way, the coalition is putting forward two amendments to help improve the government's legislation, to show the government the way. It is often said—I must say wrongly—that we are negative in the approach that we take. Here we are being extremely positive. We are offering two sensible amendments to show the government the error of its ways and asking it to take them on board to improve the legislation that it is putting forward. It will be very interesting to see what the government does with this positive approach that we are putting forward. The two amendments we are putting forward make a lot of sense. The first relates to the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian Curriculum. You would have thought that you would take that sort of assistance for granted—that schools would be granted support to implement. I would have thought that that is as logical as day following night. Sadly, it does not seem to be the case with this government. We are putting forward an amendment which would see that happen. We would see teachers getting the support that they need to implement the curriculum. Teachers would have the confidence to say: 'We are going to be teaching a national curriculum in maths, in English or in science. We know exactly what that curriculum is about. We know exactly how students need to be taught. Therefore, we have confidence going into the classroom and making sure all students across Australia get the teaching that they need to develop and go on and be wonderful individuals.' That is a very positive contribution to this debate and to this legislation, and I hope that it will be one that the government will take on board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second amendment seeks to include clear representation of the non-government school sector with respect to decision-making processes for future time lines of the national curriculum. I would just like to point out to the government and to the education minister in particular—and the one that went before him—that there are actually two types of education that we have in this country. There is a very good government sector and there is a very good non-government sector. We do not just have one sector. Therefore, if we are to get balance in the way the national curriculum time lines are to be set, about what the character of those guidelines should be, about what should be in the curricula, it would only be wise and fair that both the non-government and government sectors can play a part in doing that. If a national curriculum is to serve the learning needs of our children then we should ensure that it does it for those children who are learning in the non-government sector as much as we do it for those students learning in the government sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are two what you would call positive, modest amendments—ones which will go a long way to alleviating the recurring concerns about the curriculum process. When you look at the detail that has been in the curriculum, or the overarching framework which has been set out, there have been concerns. Our two amendments will address them. The government should do the right thing and take them on board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to point out two particular flaws that the curriculum has in it. I think most of the speakers on our side who have been before me have touched on these, because I think they are fairly important. Sadly, Labor's curriculum is driven on ideological grounds. For example, in the history component, the Labor Party and union movement is included but there is no mention of the Liberal or National parties or the parties on the conservative side of politics that went before them. Imagine if we were developing the national curriculum and we put forward that it would only address the history of the United Australia Party, the National Party, and the Country Party that came before it, and the Liberal Party. Could you imagine the outrage if we left the union movement and the Labor Party out? The other side would be just ballistic in their rage if we did that. Yet they have the gall to do it here. It just beggars belief that they could do such a thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst thing about it is it highlights what they are about here. It is not about a national curriculum which is about teaching our students across the country maths, science and English in a uniform way; sadly, there is a deeper desire here, and that is to drive the ideology through our students. I would hope that Labor would be able to look at this and say: 'This is not the right way to teach the young people of this country. We need to provide balance.' They should put themselves in our shoes from a moment and say: 'Yes, look, if the reverse was done, we would have problems with that. We need to address this.' And I hope that they will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point that I would like to make about this national curriculum as it has been developed so far by this government is that it is overcrowded. There is an excessive amount of content to be covered in courses, which means less flexibility for schools. I would have thought in the 21st century we should have been looking to put more flexibility into our schools, not less, by giving our teachers the freedoms to be able to operate within their classrooms by giving them an outline of what needs to be addressed but not detailing every last sentence. If you are trying to drive an ideological agenda maybe, because you would say: 'You have to talk about the Labor Party and the union movement. You have to talk about those things. Of course, don't worry about the other side.' It is overly prescriptive. We need to pull back from that. We have to allow teachers and our principals to be able to go about doing the things that they do best. They need the flexibility to be able to do it. I hope we will get a pullback from that overly prescriptive approach, because our students across the country will benefit from it, our teachers will benefit from it, our principals will benefit from it, and our whole education system will benefit from it. If we continue to be too prescriptive the national curriculum will not do the job it is meant to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to draw my speech tonight to a conclusion. So it is nicely rounded, I would like to go back to where I started, which is the quote from Bob Lipscombe, because I think that quote, although it is on behalf of the New South Wales education sector, reflects what the concerns are across the country as a whole:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented … We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is on the record as saying: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' She has not delivered it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to make sure that her embarrassment of not having done that does not mean that we rush our implementation now. Our kids' futures are at hand. A lot of us here have students who are going through the schooling process at the moment. We want this to be done correctly. The coalition, in a very positive manner, have put forward two amendments—two positive approaches—to try to fix the mess that the implementation of this bill is likely to create. I hope the education minister will take those two amendments on board. I hope the Prime Minister will see the positive approach on which they have been put forward and see that this is being done to improve the educational outcomes of our children and to make sure that our schools, our teachers and our principals have the right guidelines going ahead. The coalition support the idea of a national curriculum. What we do not support is the way this government is going about it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011; a bill that seeks to address a rather unfortunate oversight by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, and one twice raised in this place by the shadow minister for education, but only now sought to be fixed by the minister. The oversight referred to is the implementation date of the national curriculum—currently set for commencement in just five months time for non-government schools. This sounds like a noble goal, but it is terribly hard to implement a curriculum that is yet to be finalised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister first raised the concern about the implementation deadline for non-government schools in November last year, and earlier this year repeated calls for a simple amendment to be legislated to remove this unreachable deadline. The reforms for a national curriculum—initially promised to be implemented by January 2012—have drifted and been left incomplete by a government well known for its inability to implement programs on time or on budget have start dates now pushing out to 2013 or 2014 and a legislative deadline rapidly approaching. This bill should have been unnecessary. But for the pigheadedness of those opposite in not understanding the problems in their own legislation, the problems this bill seeks to address would have previously been addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, the fact that the national curriculum is yet to be finalised did not, of course, prevent the current Prime Minister from proclaiming on 2 July last year: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' One might have assumed that if a national curriculum had indeed been 'delivered' then an eraser would not have been needed to rub out the error riddled legislation the Prime Minister put forward back in 2008 when she was the education minister standing behind the former Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ironically, the Prime Minister claimed to have 'delivered' the national curriculum, despite falling far short of doing so by the January 2012 deadline—as we see by the need for this amendment. The Prime Minister claimed to have 'delivered' the curriculum she has not delivered, just as she promised to the Australian people she would not deliver a carbon tax and is now doing so. No wonder, today, we find a 'convoy of no confidence' on our doorstep that has travelled to Canberra from across the nation to send a clear message to this incompetent government: the Australian people want an election now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear: this government is rushing through a national curriculum not for any good educational reasons but simply for a political reason to enable the Prime Minister to live up to her claim that she has delivered it. Simply, the Prime Minister is prepared to compromise children's education for a simple political purpose. What a disgrace!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the coalition broadly supports the intent of having a national curriculum, naturally, particularly under this government, we are deeply concerned about the looming implementation stage. This is especially of concern with a new minister who, as minister for the environment, rushed through an incompetent and poorly thought out program which will go down in our nation's folklore—a program that managed to burn down some 190 homes. We certainly do not want that performance repeated on our nation's schools or on a national curriculum simply because it has to be rushed through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to air a few broad points relating to the implementation of a national curriculum—or, if you would like, the important narrative and required elements behind the move to a national curriculum. Firstly, we must not allow a race to the bottom. In my home state of New South Wales, we already have a robust curriculum, developed over decades. The last thing we want to do in New South Wales is go backwards with our children's education. I have spoken to a great many teachers in my local area that are keeping a keen eye on the development of the national curriculum, yet they remain cautious about the dangers the implementation of the national curriculum may have and how it may have the potential to water down the high standards already in place in New South Wales. For the national curriculum to produce the results that the country has asked of it, it must look to the future and not backwards into the past. There must be an assessment of the needs of our country, and we must look to where it will be in years to come and present our children with a system that will meet their needs in the future and not lock them into the ways of the past. We will gain nothing and lose much if the national curriculum fails to provide for the future. This is why it cannot and must not be rushed. It is also worth noting that across New South Wales and the rest of Australia many schools who are doubtful of the quality of the national curriculum are considering alternatives for their students, such as the benchmarking International Baccalaureate program. In the past, the New South Wales Higher School Certificate has been recognised across the globe as being a first-class finishing qualification, and the move to a standardised curriculum could see this standing ruined in the eyes of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second crucial point to recognise is the important role that all sectors in the education system play in developing our children as well-rounded young adults. The national curriculum, if not established in the correct manner, with all the relevant checks and balances satisfied, could endanger the tireless work of the many great teachers of New South Wales. These teachers, who are responsible for teaching the future of our great nation, should not be sold short and forced to teach to exams. Instead, they should be allowed and encouraged to uphold the high standards that are currently evident in New South Wales. Time and time again, we have seen the failure of Labor ideology, the ideology of a deluded belief in centralised control of decisions by a small group of elite, when our history has shown, time and time again, that the best decisions are always made by people working at the coalface. We therefore should not implement a system that would tie the hands of our world-class educators and possibly cause a drop in our educational standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Non-government schools are a crucial pillar of our education system in Australia. Without these educational institutions, some of which are over a century old, our education system would not be able to meet the demands of our population. In fact, if government funding to these schools were to be cut, the resulting burden on the state system would mean the collapse of our world-class education system. Over the past decade, class sizes in secondary schools have increased, and in some cases there are now 45 students to one teacher. Without non-government schools, this number could very easily increase still further, reducing the quality of education for all. Within my electorate of Hughes, there are many schools, government and non-government, all which are great schools filled with dedicated teachers who are teaching the next generation of Australians. I have been out and about, visiting local schools, and these visits have reinforced the importance of our work in this key area. We simply cannot get these reforms wrong through rushing them through. We must not let any of these teachers or students down by pushing them into a framework that is not ready and is not able to deliver them the results that they deserve for their hard work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the coalition will not oppose this bill, due to the obvious need for the parliament to act on what the coalition has been saying since November last year, it is not possible to implement a curriculum that is yet to be finalised. The coalition will seek to make two important amendments to enhance the progress of the reform, to deliver reform that works and that does not let our kids and their dedicated teachers down. I call on all members opposite to look deep inside themselves and to consider these amendments carefully. Do any of you really want to carry the burden of knowing that you had a choice to improve this bill and this program and chose not to for political expediency? There is a deep black hole in the current national curriculum proposal, and that is a complete lack of assistance in implementing the reforms. Currently, there is no nationally agreed or consistent approach across all jurisdictions to ensure that schools are receiving support in the area of professional development to enable teachers to implement a new national curriculum. Our amendment will rectify this to ensure a smooth transition into practice. We must offer our education professionals the training and support that they will need to implement this big change in Australia's educational system. We must not lock out teachers who work for non-government schools and, as a result, cause their students to suffer, hurting Australia's future in the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second amendment seeks to include representation from the non-government school sector in the decision-making process for future time lines of the national curriculum, providing the non-government sector with a seat at the table which they have not had to this point. This is likely a key reason why the government has thus far appeared unaware of the implementation time frame problem sought to be rectified by this bill. The government's failure to provide the non-government school sector with a seat at the table in the implementation of a national curriculum is a stark reminder of the bad old days of Mark Latham's infamous hit list, heartily supported by many members opposite during those dark days. By locking the non-government sector out of the decision-making process, we will lose the expertise and wisdom of some of the country's best and greatest educators, who want nothing more than the best education for our students. Instead of knocking down our system to the lowest common denominator, we should be seeking to raise our schools up, and to do this we should be asking for input from all educational institutions, not just those run by government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's proposed amendments are crucial to ensuring a smooth and successful implementation of the national curriculum, and while the performance of the government in this area has been weak at best, particularly in failing to recognise and act with the coalition to address the government's failures in the implementation of the national curriculum and subsequent legislative issues such as those we are having to address with this bill, I feel it is important to review what stakeholders are saying about these important coalition amendments. The President of the NSW Teachers Federation has spoken of concern about the lack of support for the implementation of the curriculum, which the coalition amendments would address. On 10 August this year he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, the coalition agree the government is failing to support our teachers to implement the national curriculum. We encourage those opposite to support our amendment on this key issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The President of the Australian Education Union also shares this position, having said previously:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we're also seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, as previous speakers have canvassed, the Independent Education Union has described our amendment to provide a seat at the table for the non-government school sector as 'an important step forward' and an amendment 'that should be supported by all parliamentarians'. The amendments to be moved by the coalition are good and sensible. I encourage those opposite to support these reasonable moves to improve the implementation of the national curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, there has been a lot of discussion regarding the overly prescriptive, biased and ideological content of the national curriculum, but I will not go into that in detail. However, as a previous speaker stated, I do understand the Labor Party and the union movement are included in this new national curriculum, whereas the Liberal Party have been left out. As a previous speaker noted, could we imagine if the reverse applied? We would not hear the end of the screams. I do not have any particular problem if the Labor Party and the union movement are included in the national curriculum—that is the way this current government is going. I simply suggest that these subjects belong in the ancient history curriculum.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="96430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EWEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to repeal the 31 January date for the implementation of the national curriculum in non-government schools as outlined in the Schools Assistance Act. I congratulate the member for Hughes and the member for Wannon, who spoke before me, for their very good contributions to this debate. However, I want to take up a couple of points made by the member for Hughes. He did go on a little too much about the strength of education in New South Wales. Everyone knows that Queensland has the best education system and the best curriculum! It is arguments like those that are divisive and are half the reason we have the problems we have. When it comes to the education of our children we must step aside and, from an educator's perspective, try to get a great result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent schools in Townsville, Australia's garrison city. Children come from every corner of Australia. We see kids graduate from schools in Townsville with a great collection of school uniforms and unfinished subjects across the board. We see confusion between the states and between curricula, and about what grade they will stay in or go to, especially when they transfer between states and sometimes even intrastate. Clearly a unified approach would be great. The only way we can get this done is with a united approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that this time frame is far too rushed. Changing the deadline is vital in ensuring that independent schools are adequately prepared for the introduction of this curriculum, the first version of which has not even been approved yet, despite protestations and assertions to the contrary even last year and despite it being less than six months until the date of its expected implementation. I reiterate the statement by Prime Minister Julia Gillard in July last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is pretty much like health reform. They talk about delivery before anything has even been parcelled up. That is probably the greatest statement since Prime Minister Chamberlain said, 'Peace in our time,' after having talks with Adolf Hitler. It is a bit too much to believe when it comes to these things. They just do not deliver. Has the Prime Minister of the country ever delivered anything so prematurely? We will wait and see because we have health reform and all sorts of reform that we are going to deliver that she has already said has been signed off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is over a year later and we still do not have a final copy of the curriculum that is ready to be used anywhere any time soon. This bill is the government's way of conceding that they have failed to deliver. They have failed to deliver the national curriculum they have been boasting about in the time line they have committed to. It is an abject failure. It should weigh heavily on the minister's mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has had the foresight to amend the act. Even in March this year the government failed to see the problem coming and are now scrambling to make the changes that we should have agreed to five months ago. As the member for Hughes said, this bill is completely and utterly unnecessary, but we support this bill as a necessary measure to ensure that non-government schools are given adequate time for the curriculum rollout. I acknowledge though that the government's blunders at every turn with the Australian curriculum have made this necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues I have with the national curriculum are not related to the concept. Like many members of the coalition, I think it is important that the curriculum taught in schools is the same in Queensland as it is in every other state. My problem is the way in which this government are so lockstep, with square peg and square hole, that so many of their policies are continually mishandled. As the member for Wannon and the member for Hughes, who spoke before me, said, there should be a framework around which school principals and individual schools can work. What a school can do in Mt Isa, Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory or Townsville is different to what a school can do in the heart of Melbourne or the heart of Sydney. There are differences and there should be a framework around which they can work to achieve the same results and get the same outcomes but give the local environment, the local identity and the local teachers and educators a chance to show why they spent four years or more at university to become teachers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This national curriculum is heavy on details but the support for it is light. Even experts across the country have acknowledged that the content will be overwhelming for many teachers. Funding to support its implementation has been completely absent. This money is essential to provide teachers with the training and professional development needs to give children a good education from a new curriculum. Too often we see that the teachers' time has been taken off. We have more and more student-free days and more and more time out for teachers for resource time when they are not in the classroom. Teachers are like nurses: they want to be in the classroom. They want to be with their class. Too often we are pulling these people away from what they want to do—what they are trained to do—to make them fill out paperwork.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has put forward two amendments, both of which I fully support, to address some of the national curriculum's shortcomings. The first of these aims to address the lack of support for schools in implementing the new curriculum. As I have said, the government has taken no measures to ensure that schools across the country are given the assistance they need to make the national curriculum a success. This amendment seeks to address this problem. The second of the coalition's amendments relates to the standing council responsible for the national curriculum time line. Neither this council nor its advisory officials committee, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee, have representatives specifically to represent the views of the non-government schools sector. That surely must set alarm bells ringing for everyone in this country. That this part of the education system does not have a dedicated voice in the decision-making process for the Australian curriculum is a serious limitation, and addressing this absence will ensure that adequate consultation of non-government schools can and should take place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Non-government schools are an integral part of Townsville's community and education sector. They are every bit as important as state schools and Catholic schools. Playing a vital part in offering parents choice and alternatives and with more than one-third of Townsville's schools being non-government, it is crucial that a group that accounts for such a big proportion of our education system be listened to when decisions regarding the implementation of the new curriculum are being and will be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to raise my concerns regarding the government's NAPLAN tests. I have had concerns in relation to NAPLAN and the way it has been rolled out since day one. I have discussed in the past in this parliament the issues I have with NAPLAN. The program has been running for four years, and it seems as though the NAPLAN agenda has completely consumed the teaching agenda. In some schools children are being taught in preschool to prepare for the year 3 NAPLAN test. In between, music, art and sport have been dropped by the wayside as people prepare for nothing else because there is so much pressure applied to the results of the NAPLAN. I was speaking to a principal at a local state school just a couple of weeks ago. He told me that he knew right now that his grade 3s next year will not do well. They know, but there is nothing they can do. They will not get the resources, so they will fail the year and their funding will be cut. Their access to these things will be cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students are taught to be proficient in the areas that NAPLAN will cover as teachers in schools do whatever they can to cater to the My School website, not to deliver a rounded education to students. I also add that there should be more aide time to go with the teacher. If you can get more aide time in primary schools and early childhood especially you will have a better result in years 9, 10, 11 and 12, because the problems of children not being taught the basics will be addressed by having a teacher there all the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The victims in all this are the areas that are so vital to a curriculum but not covered by the NAPLAN. Sport, music and art, as I have said, have all fallen by the wayside as schools have been forced to focus instead on improving their NAPLAN scores and concentrate on nothing else. Without a wide-ranging curriculum covering all areas, not only are the opportunities of these missing fields being taken away from kids; they will be less engaged in the teaching. A national curriculum is an important chance for Australia, and the government has already created far too many problems in trying to develop this change. We must get it right and we must take the time to get it right, and to get it right we need the right people sitting at the table to give their points of view—and they must be listened to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In supporting this bill I would like to add one final point. From pink batts to Building the Education Revolution, this government has created countless problems by trying to rush through problems in legislation. We just cannot afford that sort of behaviour. We cannot afford to add the Australian curriculum to that list. It cannot be done and it should not be done. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  The Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 before us today amends the original bill in order to repeal the date by which a non-systemic or approved school system must implement the Australian national curriculum. Whilst the coalition will not oppose this bill, I must say that I am frustrated—frustrated that once again in this House we are debating yet another amendment because once again the government could not get it right. Those opposite regularly stand before us, berating the coalition for what they say is opposition for opposition's sake, accusing us of only ever saying no. But how hypocritical are these claims when, back in March, when the government amended the legislation to change the implementation date for other schools, they simply said no to the coalition's amendment to address this discrepancy. They dismissed our positive and practical proposal out of hand. Why did they oppose our amendment? Only they know. However, if the government had listened at the time, we would not be here now, debating an amendment to this legislation yet again. This all could have been concluded back in March. But we should not be surprised; listening seems to be something this Gillard government regularly fails to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports the principle of a national curriculum. However, I take offence that Prime Minister Gillard has claimed that she has already delivered it. In July last year the Prime Minister stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Prime Minister had indeed delivered a national curriculum back in 2008, when she claimed to, we would not be standing here, having this debate today, three years later. The national curriculum was due to be implemented from January of this year. It was not. It is still not ready, and stakeholders have serious concerns with both the content and the fact that no funding has been proposed to support schools and teachers through this massive change to our education system. Yet from what the Prime Minister said last year, as far as she is concerned a national curriculum was delivered last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In principle I support a national curriculum. Like the International Baccalaureate does at an international level a national curriculum would provide an equal education standard around Australia, avoiding much angst when families need to move interstate. In our transient society, it is important that students are comfortable within their learning environment, and a national curriculum helps to give them confidence. A national curriculum provides students with broader opportunities, both domestically and internationally, as their achievements are more quantifiable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when will this Gillard government admit that making an announcement does not equal reform? Making an announcement does not equal delivery. Real reform comes with competent delivery, smooth implementation, and open and transparent consultation with stakeholders. When you look at this government's track record of schemes such as Fuelwatch, home insulation, and Building the Education Revolution, I have grave concerns as to how the national curriculum will be rolled out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This concern is compounded as there does not seem to be any funding or support for the necessary training required for a national curriculum to succeed. It is imperative that teachers, in both the government and the non-government sector, receive adequate support throughout this process. That is why the coalition is moving an amendment to ensure that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the national curriculum. I do not think anyone on either side of this House would deny the importance of our teachers. Teachers are an integral part of our society, shaping the youngest in our society into lifelong learners. I also do not think that anyone in this House would deny that teachers are already undertaking a massive job with enormous responsibility often without the support they deserve and need. With the introduction of a national curriculum, their workload will increase—there is no doubt about that. An entire overhaul of the teaching curriculum will take time to learn how to teach and deliver, and would greatly benefit from teacher training and development. This is common sense, and has been endorsed by the Independent Education Union yet the government has not taken moves to ensure this occurs for non-government schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the government does not understand the concerns of these stakeholders. Again, we face an issue about a lack of consultation. I have spoken on a number of bills before parliament this year which have had a major impact on the direction of industry, the economy and the Australian people. Yet with many of these bills, there has been a very limited consultation period in which stakeholders could voice their concern, raise issues and make suggestions. It seems that this may be happening again, as the concerns expressed by experts in education, teacher representative groups, and professional associations share the coalition's concern about the lack of funding. However it does not seem that their voices are being heard. Non-government schools do not have specific representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. This means that non-government schools have little opportunity to share their experience and thoughts on the implementation of a national curriculum, despite being greatly affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is today moving an amendment to rectify that. The government is introducing a national curriculum across the board to both government and non-government schools. This means that students and teachers in both forms of schooling will be affected, so it is very important that representatives from both are heard. Around half of all students will attend a non-government school at some point during their education, and non-government schools bring further ideas and considerations to the table. Non-government school representation is an important step forward, and I hope it is one that the government will take on board and action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have 19 non-government schools in my electorate which educate a significant number of students. These students will experience the national curriculum just like those at the 26 government schools in my electorate—as will their teachers and school staff. They also need support and representation as the coalition provides for in our two amendments to this bill. Even more importantly these students, teachers, administrators and parents should not be overlooked again by this government just as they were overlooked in March with the original amendments to the implementation timeline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I trust that this government will take a good look at its failures to date and go forward with the national curriculum in a much more positive way, not bungling its implementation as it has with so many other programs. The coalition amendments to be moved would be a good start. I trust that this Gillard government does not ignore them out of spite as seemingly happened back in March when the government missed an opportunity to rectify the blown out implementation time line for all schools. Let us not see such an important change to Australian education mismanaged again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="WN6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IAN MACFARLANE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  I rise to speak tonight on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011 and the Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011. The Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011 amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to clarify and confirm the area encompassed by the 'rank and trend', as it is known, condensate production area located within the North West Shelf project area. The Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011 amends the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to clarify that failure to provide petroleum producers with written notification setting out the terms of a volume-weighted average of realised prices determination does not affect the making of that determination, the measure of firms, or the current application of the crude oil excise regime as it applies to condensate production. And I make it clear, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, at the outset, that the coalition will be supporting these bills. However in doing so, the coalition will move an amendment to the motion of the second reading that condemns this Labor government for its assault on the Australian energy and resources sector and for its comprehensive mismanagement of the investment framework for oil and gas exploration and the resources sector in general.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to identifying which areas of policy this government has so fundamentally mismanaged, there is some very serious competition amongst its incompetence. Along with the well-publicised failures in border protection, there is the Prime Minister's carbon tax backflip which has, in itself, made its own assault on the resources industry by making it, and it alone, pay a carbon price on the fuel it uses. There is even further competition though on the bungling of the school halls program, the pink batts program and, most recently, the mishandling of the issues involved with live exports which has decimated Northern Australia. It is not just the cattlemen and women involved who are affected, but also the truck drivers, the Aboriginal stockmen, and the economy of Northern Australia which has been built around this incredibly important export trade. So incompetent is this government that they could not even get that right. The Gillard government has inflicted some extraordinarily counterproductive and destructive policies on a sector that has contributed so significantly to our economy and should be given the opportunity to continue to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The oil and gas industry over time has made an enormous contribution to Australia's economy. But just as importantly, it has provided the energy security that other countries would literally kill for. We are one of the few countries in the OECD—the only country that springs to mind—that is in fact an energy exporter in its own right. That is, we have a surplus of energy which we export. Part of that export is condensate from the North West Shelf, originally exempted as part of the incentives that were provided to this very important industry to get the project off the ground. And whilst we see those incentives ripped away by this government, we also see a very significant change in attitude within the oil and gas sector, and potentially the investors in that industry in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the government's deliberate actions, Australia has been forced to suffer an erosion of our previously gilt-edged sovereign risk profile when it comes to investment in the energy and resources sector in this country. There can be no excuses for this government-led assault based on changing international circumstances or economic difficulties given that one of the very first acts of the Labor government after it was elected in November 2007 was to slug a massive tax increase on the oil and gas sector, in particular the North West Shelf, by removing the exemption that had applied to condensate. It is fair to say that without that exemption and without some very significant courage by the players at the time the exemption was introduced, including of course Sir Charles Court, the Premier of Western Australia, this condensate would be still lying under the seabed thousands of metres down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition governments, Liberal governments in particular, go out of their way to provide incentives to get these resources developed. The moment that happens we have a government currently in power, the Labor government, that then does everything it can not only to rip away the money that these companies have put at risk and have then earned quite justly but also to destroy our international sovereign risk profile. We on this side of the House, and of course the wider community, have also been aware of the Labor Party's complete and absolute inability to manage money. We have seen the field evidence from successive Labor governments that apply the big-spending, big-taxing philosophy, and this legislation is just more proof of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But even though I am conditioned to this big-taxing, big-spending government, I was shocked when the former Rudd government so brazenly slapped a $2.5 billion excise on condensate. This signalled a very clear intention that this was to be a government that would view the resource sector as nothing more than a cash cow. I am sorry to say that the government has lived up to, or should I say lived down to, that expectation it has created. While the oil and gas industry, in particular the offshore sector, has spent much of history well out of the public spotlight, it is nonetheless one of the most substantial sectors in our economy. During my time as minister responsible for this sector, the coalition government took great care to encourage investment and to facilitate an environment that would be conducive to exploration and production where appropriate. I travelled the world, literally, selling Australia's wares, telling of the opportunities that lay in Australia, telling of the stability of the government regimes, and providing exploration incentives to try to get companies to invest here. And what happens? We get a government now desperate for money. The government's $2.5 billion tax slug has sent a shiver down the spines of major investors in the oil and gas sector because it has shown that this is a government that is prepared to be cavalier with investment, with issues of sovereign risk and with Australia's very dearly held reputation as a safe investment destination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before the House today is one of the consequences of the government's multibillion-dollar cash grab and an attempt to clean up some of the confusion it has created from that tax grab in the zone covered by that taxation. Unfortunately, but ever responsibly, the coalition wants to end that confusion and that is why we are supporting these amendments. As I mentioned, we will not oppose these bills because we take the responsible attitude that investors in the oil and gas sector deserve some certainty in this very uncertain climate, even in a situation where the government seems to go out of its way to create uncertainty. As I say, it is our responsibility to bring what stability we can as a coalition and as an opposition to this very uncertain playing field.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter how the government may try to spin it, the subsequent projects in this field are in spite of what the government is doing, in spite of the hurdles it is putting in place and certainly not because the government has put in place anything like appropriate policy settings. It seems to wake up daily wondering how it can tax this whole resources sector yet again and, even more, how it can tear down any incentive that we put in place previously to compete against those investment destinations around the world that are out there every day trying to tear the investment dollar away from Australia.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear a sense of complacency from this government, which assumes that because Australia has had past successes in oil and gas exploration it will continue to be a productive sector regardless of how badly the government handles the regulatory settings or how badly it handles the taxation of that industry. As I mentioned, it was one of the very first actions of the Labor government to reach further into the pockets of the successful enterprises, to ramp up the taxes after all the risks had been taken, after the resource companies and investors—many of them Australian mums and dads—had put their capital at risk in a project which, I can assure you, was exceptionally borderline in its instigation in the mid-to-late eighties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the government ramp up the taxes to this sector to provide a convenient cover for the profligate spending, which has come from those who sit opposite. This huge tax burden was slapped on the industry with no warning and no consultation. Even the Minister for Resources and Energy found out after the event. What sort of government would do this to such an important sector? It is a government that knows no bounds when it comes to applying taxes and shattering the investment security that companies and investors from overseas look for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is little comfort that we now recognise in retrospect that this action is the standard operation procedure for this Labor government, particularly when it comes to decisions that affect the energy and resources sector. As we know from the resources super profits tax debacle, which not only affected onshore exploration and mining but also offshore exploration and development, and from the ongoing mess that surrounds the new version of the minerals resource rent tax and the toxic carbon tax, the Rudd and Gillard government simply do not understand or do not care about the dynamics in the resources sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modelling done on the impact of the carbon price on industry estimates that a carbon price of $25 a tonne would close 16 coal mines and cost 23,000 jobs in that industry alone, many of them in the electorate or adjoining the electorate of my colleague here, the member for Paterson. I can assure this House that the member for Paterson—and I had the pleasure of being up there with him the other day—is tireless in his efforts to protect jobs in the Hunter Valley. And those who sit opposite—one them is here; I will be interested if she stands up and speaks on this bill and explains why she is happy to tax the industries in her electorate—sit silent while jobs in their electorates get wasted.</span>

                    </a>  Deputy Speaker, I do expect them to sit silent in the House but I do not expect them to sit silent in their electorates. They should be out there fighting for local jobs; they should be out there, like the member for Paterson, defending local industries. Access Economics estimated that a carbon price of $26 a tonne will cost 126,000 jobs in Australia by 2020. We are seeing jobs disappear every day. And while those jobs, it could be argued, are not directly associated with the imminent introduction of the carbon tax, I cannot believe that people are not considering the impact of that carbon tax in their decisions because you do not make an investment decision today, whether it is to open or close something, without thinking about what your prospects are over the next 20 years. Not many on that side have been in business—I understand that. It is a given: you have to be in a union if you want to sit on that side. But those of us who sit on this side have been in business and know that when you make an investment decision you make it for 20 years. In imposing tax after tax after tax—like this condensate tax, the carbon tax, the mining and resource rent tax, any new tax they can think up at any time—all you are doing is chasing that investment away. I cannot believe that we have a government that, despite all of this and the economic insecurity in international markets, is still charging blindly into putting in place more taxes, in particular the carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with the carbon tax are the financial and the investment insecurity produced by the MRRT. The government's mismanagement of this issue and the RSPT, the resource super profits tax, that came before it and was such a disaster means that the energy sector has little or no faith in the direction this government is taking. The signature policy that underpins this budget, the minerals resource rent tax, continues to fall apart. It continues to build in a deficit that could occur at any time. It could not make the budget more uncertain if it tried. Treasury figures show that with the MRRT the current Prime Minister's backdown will translate into a $60 billion hit to the budget bottom line. This certainly will build in a structural deficit by having this government relying not only on the prices of the resource but also the currency fluctuations. How the Treasurer can sit in this House and say he can budget with those sorts of questions hanging over his head is beyond me. This perhaps again highlights the incompetence of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government persists with the flawed MRRT not only it is going to put the budget stability at risk but also it is going to show this government is rolling the dice on questions of energy security and future mining investment. Sudden changes such as the condensate tax which we are talking about continue to reinforce that instability and that impact on investment security. The government constantly changing the rules of the game for investments is jeopardising Australia's once gilt-edged sovereign risk profile and making Australia a less attractive place for investment, particularly in the energy generation sector. The coalition believes that decisions about taxation paid by the mining industry should be done under the existing regime of state based royalties because the resource belongs to the people of that state. It does not belong to the Commonwealth. It should be a decision made by the state. It has worked well in the past and will continue to work well once the coalition is re-elected and we rescind the MRRT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this taxation—tax and spend, tax and spend; putting new taxes on the oil and gas industry, putting new taxes on the mining industry, changing those taxes—sends a simple message: other countries that are our main competitors are better investment options. The real impact of the Gillard government's carbon tax, the mineral resource tax, the change to the condensate tax, the change to excise regimes in relation to fuel is on the mining industry, which has been singled out by this government to pay the carbon tax on fuel straight up. No industry or group will pay the carbon price on fuel except the mining industry. Why doesn't the Prime Minister just stand up at that box each day and say to the oil and gas industry and the mining industry, 'We hate you and we're going to tax you out of existence'? That is what she is trying to do. She is trying to get as much money as she can from the sector that is holding our economy together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen recent examples of even Australian based resource companies deciding that they no longer want to invest here. David Flanagan of Atlas Iron, a self-made man, put his and his wife's money at risk; he took the big dive to build up a company and get it rolling. He is going to be taxed on that at a level never seen before and at a rate far higher than his bigger competitors BHP, Rio and Xstrata. David's company's response to that is to make an investment in Brazil of $18.7 million that will not be invested in the resource sector here and will not give Australians the opportunity to have jobs. It simply has got far too hard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister can expect to read plenty more about companies choosing to invest in projects in other countries, given the damage this government has inflicted on the sovereign risk profile of Australia's energy and resources sector. As it stands at the moment, the series of taxes including this condensate tax undermines Australia's energy security and risks international investment in the vital energy and resources sector. Coming at a time when the economy is also being slugged with a carbon tax, these policies show how poorly this government understands the contribution of the energy and resources sector and how ill equipped the government is to handle the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this government has been digging deeper and deeper into the pockets of Australian workers and businesses. Every day it discovers a new way to tax people, like the quarter of a million Australian families who are now going to be taxed on the LPG they use in their family motor cars. Introduced by the Howard government, an incentive has been paid to these families to convert their cars to LPG. But like a honey trap, this government gets them into that position where they rely on LPG and then it taxes it. They cannot get away—unbelievable. But that is just part of how this government operates. It operates in a policy vacuum—no energy white paper, no direction to industry on how it is going to be done, no backdrop of how energy and resources investments should be made. The only messages that come out are: 'Here's a new condensate tax; here's a new carbon tax; here's a new LPG tax; here's a new tax on resources.' The energy and resources sector is constantly being used as a cash cow for this big-taxing, big-spending government that cannot control its own finances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy and resources sector, including the oil and gas and the mining industries, is one of the driving forces behind the Australian economy. At the moment, it is sustaining the economy at a time of global difficulty, and when the manufacturing sector faces difficulties in competing with the very high dollar and the imports that are coming in. But we have a government, as I have said repeatedly and will continue to say both in this House and outside, that has no qualms about taxing this industry whenever it can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will not object to these bills, but the Gillard government should stand condemned for its continued and comprehensive mismanagement of policies that apply to this sector and its high-taxing, high-spending regime that is hitting all sectors of the economy.</span>

I also stand to oppose the amendment moved by the member for Groom. Contrary to the member for Groom and the accusations he has made, I support these bills because they evidence this government's strong fiscal discipline and represent many of the values that we as a government hold at our core. All Australians should benefit collectively from the natural resources that we have inherited. They are not resources that will continue forever. They are finite resources, and these bills foster the fairer distribution of their benefit throughout the Australian community, with government correctly acting as the conduit between the people and corporate institutions.</span>

I find it quite surprising that the opposition would put a very different case when they have a $70 billion black hole in their budget forecast to explain.</span>

We will not shirk our responsibility to keep our economy strong and produce a more prosperous society, and we will continue to make the reforms to the taxation system that are necessary to modernise the economy and foster the growth of our society. We have not and will not put sovereign wealth at risk, as the member for Groom recklessly suggests. But, yes, we will remove a tax break that is absolutely past its use-by date.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1977, the federal government has exempted condensate production from the crude oil excise regime, recognising the need to support the exploration and development of petroleum resources within the North West Shelf. As a result of the exemption, petroleum fields in the region matured, the energy demand of the people of Western Australia was satisfied and business benefited from the excise exemption in the order of more than $1 billion. However, since then, the Australian economy has radically changed and the business environment has shifted. The exemption has become outdated and no longer reflects the current needs of the resource sector. Yesterday, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Times</span> reported that BHP Billiton is expected to unveil full-year earnings for 2011 of US$22.1 billion, while Rio Tinto's half-year net profit was approximately US$7.6 billion. With oil prices for non-renewable energy resources remaining high, the subsidisation of resource divestment in the North West Shelf is no longer necessary.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greenpeace highlighted this in their submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy when they asked the government to consider redirecting excise exemptions for non-renewable energy production to the development of renewable energy technologies. That is exactly what we have been doing for three years—trying to invest again and to encourage investment in renewable energy technologies after 12 years of neglect by the Howard government. That sentiment was not only expressed by Greenpeace; it was reiterated by the Executive Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Don Henry. Shane Wright, the economics editor for the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>hardly a socialist rag for the chattering classes, summarised this line of thinking succinctly when he asked:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree and would suggest that the member for Groom should take note of that comment by an established economics commentator from Western Australia no less.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to modernise the excise regime, we removed the crude oil excise exemption on condensate in the 2008-09 budget through the Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2008 and the Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill of 2008 with effect from 13 May of that year. In the absence of government subsidy, condensate and crude oil are now taxed in a similar manner. As resource management expert, Dr Richard Griffiths commented, 'There is no strong argument for exemption other than the usual one—that no-one likes to be taxed,' but this legislation simply closes a loophole. It does impose a new tax.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills clarify the application of the current excise regime to condensate production on the North West Shelf and amend the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 Specifically, they address the existing uncertainty regarding the prescription of the Rankin Trend condensate production area in order to effectively implement the condensate measure and clarify that a failure to provide written notification of a price determination to a producer does not invalidate that determination. This is because BHP Billiton and its six partners in the North West Shelf LNG resource project have commenced proceedings in the Federal Court alleging that the Rankin Trend is of uncertain size and therefore invalid; and that the condensate production areas located on the North West Shelf operated by North West Shelf LNG consist of several gas fields rather than one field, thereby allowing for a larger production threshold before the excise cuts in. The consortia further allege that the VOLWARE prices were not valid as written notification of the price determinations had not been provided to producers as required.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The original measures introduced in 2008 are estimated to raise approximately $2.8 billion by 1 July 2012 and will increase the return to the Australian community from the non-renewable resources that are extracted from our soil. It is because of the financial implications of the consortia's challenge to the abolition of the excise exemption that we have decided to act proactively and legislate to define the Rankin Trend—$2.8 billion; I do not think anyone would agree that that has to be ripped out of our economy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do note that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has criticised this legislation as a retrospective 'trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of principle 1(a)(i) of the Committee's terms of reference'. This is because the measures contained in this bill take effect from midnight 13 May 2008, consistent with the original 2008-09 budget measure. Yet, with all due respect, it seems clear that these bills do not effect a retrospective impost on corporations operating on the North West Shelf but clarify the existing state of the law. Accordingly, it is not retrospective in the sense that the committee has suggested and not contrary to modern notions of the rule of law or individual rights and liberties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are a testament to our ongoing work to ensure the fair distribution of opportunity in this country and our belief that all Australians should benefit collectively from the resources that are extracted from our soil and which rightly belong to all the people of this country. In this respect, these bills are similar to the mining resource rent tax, which will be legislated later this year, because they ensure that the Australian people receive greater benefit from the development of our mineral resources. It surprises me that the member for Groom so roundly criticises that measure when I know how much he has been involved in some of the calculations around that. By removing the condensate excise exemption, the federal government can reallocate the subsidies and invest in the infrastructure we need for the future. It can reduce company tax rates and ensure that every sector of our patchwork economy prospers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition, in moving their amendment, would suggest that we destroy our international sovereign risk portfolio. Not only is that rubbish; it is reckless. We are blessed as a nation with absolute security for investors. Investors know that they get a regulatory framework that is strong and fair. They know that they get skilled labour. They know that they get the support of government. They know that they operate in a safe and secure environment. They know that these sorts of changes and reforms will occur. They are not radical; they are a natural progression for a country that has achieved great wealth from its mineral resources. They are about sustaining wealth and making sure the benefits of that wealth flow to as many people as possible and to the generations of the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition condemns these bills as an assault on the energy and resources sector. That has never happened under this government. Our ministers in those areas—Martin Ferguson, in particular—have worked hand in glove with the energy and resources industry sector and have, I think, their respect and trust. They know we will be tough and pursue our agenda, but they know we will consult, discuss and, when it comes down to it, if we differ, the government will pursue its agenda as it should in the best interests of the public of this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think about the framework of change of legislation, I am sure the member for Groom did not mean the very much more robust safety regimes we have put in around oil and gas exploration and production. I hope he did not mean that, because we have created so much legislation to protect the sector from the damaging fallout of incidents that we have seen around the country. I think we all remember the spill on the north-west coast and how fortunate we were that that did not have a greater impact, and we have responded to all the findings from those studies. The member for Groom thinks that somehow this is legislation about the carbon tax. No, it is not about pricing carbon and it is quite scurrilous to suggest it is. He quotes studies about job losses and says that there will be job losses in my area. In fact, overall there will be job growth. There will be transition; there will be transformation. Newcastle is our best example of dealing with transition and transformation of our economy. We also know that you cannot just oppose; you cannot just condemn; you do have to be held to account. It is time the opposition were held to account. They pose no solutions at this stage for their $70 billion hole and their economic mismanagement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, I want to congratulate the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and the federal Labor government since 2007, not just on this bill but on taking on, simplifying, harmonising, amalgamating, modernising and correcting anomalies in so many areas of taxation legislation. This is just one of so many pieces of legislation that has found its way before the House by a responsible government that certainly is making our economy stronger. Finally, I commend the bills to the House and I oppose the amendment moved by the member for Groom.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAASE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  I rise this evening to make some comment in this debate in relation to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011 and the cognate bill. Of course, this measure is almost shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. I do accept that the major purpose of this amendment is to dispel any doubt as to the impact of the original measure, which was the removal of an exemption from paying excise on condensate that was won as almost a by-product of the development of the North West Shelf gas fields, specifically the Rankin field.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure you recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the North West Shelf gas field was viable only after very long negotiations and strong commitment by the Western Australian government and specifically Sir Charles Court, who negotiated considerations for the Woodside North West Shelf group that allowed such a project to proceed. In the days prior to the commencement of that project, Australia was awash with sceptics—awash with individuals who could come up with every reason for not proceedings with investment in the North West Shelf gas project. The late Sir Charles, to his great credit, had a vision for the development of that petroleum field and could see quite clearly that, so long as the administrative process was put in place that gave some consideration to that project and its investors, it could be a successful project. All went well. I was most fortunate to be a resident of Karratha in those heady years of the commencement of that Woodside project. I saw the changes, so many of them for the greater good of, firstly, the Pilbara community of Dampier and Karratha but, secondly, of Western Australia and the nation as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that was a very long time ago. With the emergence of Woodside as a mature, sophisticated, technically competent company and its very large workforce, one Mr Gary Gray emerged as an employee of Woodside. To the great credit of Woodside, they encouraged his challenge to the electorate of Brand, and it is history that his challenge was successful and he was elected as the member for Brand. Everyone in Western Australia was very happy to have as a member of the federal parliament a member who had good sense, excellent knowledge and experience in the oil and gas industry, because we did not have somebody with such qualifications previously. Woodside was very happy; Gary Gray was very happy; the Labor Party of Western Australia was very happy—and then along came the May 2008 budget. Boy, oh, boy, didn't we see some radical change from that point! We saw the new member for Brand absolutely backstabbed and insulted because a pack of greenies headed by Greenpeace decided that the exemption that was being offered to Woodside—which, do not forget, was the very reason that this project was finally financially viable—should not be allowed. This whole strategy was knifed by Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have just heard the member for Newcastle waxing lyrical about the fine skills of the Treasurer and Treasury in getting it right. My goodness! I thought that, amongst all of the other failings of the member for Newcastle, blindness would not be one of them. She commended Treasury and the Treasurer simply on the basis of turning green. We know the reason, of course: it keeps Bob Brown and his henchmen close and cooperating with the stated intention of this government, which is simply to stay in power at any cost for as long as possible, because, if we go to an election, there will be an absolute abject failure by this government to win the votes necessary to get back in power. So there was an act of treachery that quite clearly paved the way for the final treatment of Kevin Rudd—and we know what happened to him. There seems to be little doubt that the Australian public's attitude towards and definition of this government right now—that this is a toxic government wanting to impose a further toxic tax—is pretty much spot on. The training ground in treachery was the knifing of the member for Brand, Gary Gray—who, I might add, is a very honourable fellow—as well as the about-face in the treatment of Woodside condensate and the resultant disillusionment of Woodside. That company had no knowledge that they were going to have the rug pulled from under them and a $2 billion-dollar tax—a trifling amount, I am sure, to this Treasurer, but an amount that was very important to Woodside, to West Australians and to shareholders in Woodside—imposed on them. But I am sure that, if it was justified by the leader of Greenpeace, it was all right, because it would have been in keeping with the attitudes espoused by Bob Brown of the Greens and by the Treasurer in cooperating with Greenpeace and the Greens in order to maintain power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is very specific and highly technical. It defines the Rankin Trend—some condensate is from geological areas within the Rankin Trend, while other condensate is not. Previously, condensate from the Rankin Trend was exempted; under this bill, it is intended that it will no longer be exempted. It is very boring legislation, but, typically, it makes its intentions very clear. It is also retrospective—it dates back to 13 May 2008 in its impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In discussions surrounding this bill tonight, we have heard much criticism by the member for Newcastle of the comments of the member for Groom. The member for Groom wanted simply to point out that we do not act sensibly if we aspire to reducing carbon emissions but do not recognise the gas industry for what it is worth. It is an industry that will reduce pollution relative to the pollution that may have been caused had we used coal as an energy, and we fail to recognise that at our own expense. Therefore, I think it is quite reasonable to state that this bill almost represents yet another own goal. It strikes me as extremely lopsided to attack an industry that will produce fewer emissions by imposing additional taxes on it, which this legislation does—and here I am merely clarifying where the legislation will hit—whilst trying to reduce emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other statement of the member for Groom that was questioned by the member for Newcastle was that this bill represents further evidence that Australia's good reputation as a secure location for international investment was being further trashed by the actions of this government. But if anyone doubts that, they need simply to lift their gaze to the horizon by communicating with a few of our overseas finance houses and looking at some of the internal mail every time there is an action such as this which further destroys the reputation of, firstly, the Rudd government and, secondly, the Gillard government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great deal going for us in this nation. We are incredibly rich in mineral wealth and petroleum resources, we are in very close proximity to Asia and therefore some of our strongest trading partners, we have had in the past very secure and predictable administration and a safe working environment as well as, in recent times, very efficient ports—many of them privately controlled and run—and infrastructure which works in an incredibly efficient manner by comparison with other port and rail infrastructure in the world. Yet all of those assets are going to amount to nothing if we cannot say to our overseas investors, whose capital is mobile and able to land in any part of the globe, 'Your investment is safe because our taxation regime is consistent.' Those investors will be inclined to overlook our proximity to markets, the efficiency of our materials handling infrastructure and our good record in the area of industrial relations. We trash our reputation as a secure location for investment every time we change the rules after the commencement of the game. We have seen too much evidence in the life of the Rudd and then the Gillard governments of a highly valued reputation trashed time and again overseas to the point where many commentators have raised issues like: 'What are you doing down there, shooting yourself in the foot? Why are you coming up with these taxation changes that will send investors away in droves?' For anybody to suggest that the security of investment in Australia today is equal to that prior to the 2007 election is in dreamland. Ask any international investor whether our reputation today stacks up with that of pre-2007 and they will say emphatically, 'No'. They sincerely hope that it is not trashed any further with any other crazy ideas emerging as policy from cooperation with the Greens or aspirations to take minute portions of reviews of taxation and impose all of the stick and none of the benefits, as has been done too often. I support the push for amendment of this bill and I thank the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011 and the Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011. In the 2008-09 budget the Labor government announced the removal of the crude oil excise exemption that had applied to condensate production since 1977. Condensate production is subject to an excise regime that is the equivalent to that applying to stabilised crude oil discovered on or after 18 September 1975. Under the regime the excise is applied to condensate production from individual prescribed condensate production areas in a manner that is similar to income tax: higher rates apply to production exceeding certain thresholds up to a maximum of 30 per cent. To implement the condensate measure the Commissioner of Taxation issued a bylaw prescribing both Rankin Trend, which contains a number of condensate producing reservoirs, and Angel as being condensate production areas located on the North West Shelf production area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and it does so for a simple reason. The aim of the legislation is to address uncertainty regarding the scope of the Rankin Trend. The legislation will statutorily define the Rankin Trend production area principally by reference to those reservoirs within the intended Rankin Trend area that are currently producing condensate. The amendments also provide for the resources minister to add known but currently non-producing reservoirs to Rankin Trend by specifying them in regulations. Where he is satisfied that they form part of the Rankin Trend field and after considering the effect that specification may have on the efficient exploitation of the resource. As a result of this bill the price of condensate on which excise duty is calculated is known as the volume weighted average realised price, or the VOLWARE price. It is determined in accordance with the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987. That act provides that oil producers have to be provided with written notice of VOLWARE price determinations. The Excise Legislation Amendment (Condensate) Bill 2011 amends the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to clarify the failure to provide petroleum producers with written notification does not invalidate the determination and consequently eliminate crude oil excise liability. I do not think any of us in this House would like to see that outcome. The amendments together will ensure that crude oil excise applies to condensate which is consistent with the original policy intent and the revenue collected to date is protected. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The North West Shelf partners commenced a legal challenge to their condensate excise liability on technical grounds. They argued that the condensate production area known as Rankin Trend is not valid as it is of uncertain size and that the VOLWARE prices were not valid because the written notification of the price determinations had not been provided to producers as required. These amendments will provide clarity and they will clearly define the scope of the Rankin Trend area and clarify the failure to provide a written notice of a price determination does not invalidate the determination. They will apply from midnight on 13 May 2008 and that is consistent with the original decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition, while not necessarily opposing the legislation, have moved an amendment to this and their amendment goes to a much broader set of issues. As is their wont, the opposition—they are after all the 'no' party—have used this opportunity again to put three noes on the table. They want to say 'no' to the condensate tax—it will be interesting to see how they vote on this one—'no' to carbon pricing, and 'no' to a minerals resource rent tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to provide the economic context in which Australia is sitting at the moment. When the global economic downturn happened, Australia acted as quickly as any other country in the world. We had in place household stimulus payments as early as October 2008. That was extraordinarily fast and reflects the fact that many of those senior public servants dealing with this downturn had cut their teeth on the recession of the early 1990s, a recession in which it is generally acknowledged fiscal and monetary policy acted too slowly. That was not the case in the latest downturn. We put in place timely, temporary and targeted fiscal stimulus. We did it in two different tranches. Economics clearly tells us that household payments have a lower bang for the buck—a smaller multiplier effect—but they act quickly. So a portion of the stimulus came in household payments. Economic theory also tells us that infrastructure expenditure has a higher bang for the buck—a higher multiplier—but takes longer to take effect. So the package sensibly, as the OECD and the IMF suggested, contained elements of both of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have strong evidence that both sides of that package worked. For example, my own work when I was an economics professor at the ANU, which surveyed recipients of stimulus payments, estimated that a substantial portion of those stimulus payments was spent and went directly back into the economy. You can see that simply by looking at the timing of the stimulus payments and putting them on top of retail trade figures: there were big spikes in retail trade in December and again when the second tranche of payments came out around February, March and April. This was absolutely critical. We know that in a downturn it is the construction sector that is hit hardest—the construction sector is a particularly cyclical part of the economy—and so the infrastructure that we put in place was enormously important in ensuring that construction jobs were maintained, that young apprentices who had just started out in their careers were able to continue working and that you did not get the demoralising, debilitating and deskilling effect that a downturn can cause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I left high school in 1990, just as the early nineties recession was starting to hit, and I can tell you that a recession is not a pretty time to leave high school. Many of my friends spent a long time looking for work. That did not happen this time around. Youngsters who left Australian high schools in 2008-09 were able to walk into an economy where the unemployment rate was the envy of much of the developed world. The unemployment rate now is only five per cent in Australia, substantially below the nine per cent in the United States and the eight per cent in the United Kingdom. It is so often mentioned by economic policymakers in this country—not just the Treasurer but also the Reserve Bank governor—that when they go to international meetings and sit amidst their counterparts from developed nations there is no-one in that room who would not happily trade places with them and take on the economic fundamentals of Australia. Those economic fundamentals are extraordinarily strong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debt that we took on arose from two sources. One is the revenue downgrades. In a recession revenues fall, particularly corporate profits, so two-thirds of the rise in debt is actually just a result of the effect that the lower company profits had on government revenues. The other third is the stimulus payments. So, every time you hear a member of the coalition saying Australia should have no debt, you need to recognise exactly what they are saying. They say that, when the global financial crisis hit, Australia should have taken the Herbert Hoover approach and slashed government spending. Not only are those people anti stimulus; they are actually saying we should have contracted government spending when the global downturn hit. That is what an anti-debt position amounts to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But our debt is modest. When many countries in the OECD have debt levels that are nearly their entire annual GDP and sometimes higher, Australia's is $7,000 of debt for every $100,000 of income. That is about the level of debt that many households would take on to buy a small car. I do not recommend it, but there are many Australian households that carry $7,000 worth of credit card debt. So Australia's debt must be put into perspective and we must always remember what we bought for that debt: 200,000 jobs saved. That is 200,000 lives that were not blighted by unemployment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the opposition's amendment also goes to attacking the minerals resource rent tax, a tax which will put in place a fairer regime for the taxation of minerals in this country—a regime that will ensure that Australians get a fair share of the minerals that are their birthright—and a more economically efficient way of taxing minerals resource rents based on profits, not on royalties. We are also putting in place carbon pricing. We are doing that because every credible economist tells you that if you want to deal with a negative externality—and that is what carbon pollution is in economic jargon—then you go straight to the source of the problem. You put a price on carbon pollution, and that is exactly what we are doing. By contrast, the opposition, when they do not like the fact that they cannot find a single economist to back their so-called direct action plan, attack economists. So the Leader of the Opposition will go out and say that the fact that he cannot find an economist to back his plan is a reflection on the quality of the Australian economics profession. As my good friend Joshua Gans said, 'No, I think that's a reflection on the quality of Australian opposition leaders.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to look at the fiscal situation in which the opposition now find themselves. They are currently in a $70 billion black hole. I do not think we have spoken in Australian politics of a black hole of these proportions. We have in the past spoken of black holes; one side of politics or another has spoken of black holes of a few billion dollars or maybe $10 billion. But $70 billion? This really is unprecedented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go and break it down a little. Thirty-seven billion dollars of that black hole is spending commitments that the opposition announced during the election. Eleven billion dollars of that black hole would come from unwinding the minerals resource rent tax, saying to mining companies, 'You'd be paying too much tax under the minerals resource rent tax; here, have a little bit back,' and, of course, unwinding the superannuation for low-income earners, the company tax cuts for small businesses and the many good economic reforms that flow from that package. Another $27 billion of the coalition's $70 billion black hole comes from unwinding the carbon price—$24 billion in gross revenues from carbon pricing and another $3 billion from the coalition's direct action plan. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is under the lower estimates for the coalition's expenditure. As you would recall, the coalition have now moved to a 'we don't deal with foreigners' approach when it comes to carbon pricing, which makes their approach to climate change all the more expensive. Another $7 billion to $8 billion is to fund their income tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In practical terms, what does that $70 billion in savings mean? It means stopping Medicare payments for four years, stopping the age pension for two years, stopping assistance to people with disabilities for three years or stopping family tax benefit payments for three years. It requires savings equivalent to doubling the GST for a single year. This is the situation in which the coalition find themselves. It is extraordinary that they are now willing to trash their economic credentials on virtually every issue. The coalition spokesperson for agriculture is now saying that Australia should start a trade war with New Zealand. What could be more economically irresponsible? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:00</span>):  The Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill before the House is an embarrassing leftover from the Leader of the Opposition's attempt to have a vote that even he said he would not abide by. Having told this parliament that a plebiscite was going to be brought before it, the Leader of the Opposition has had to follow through. But it is difficult to know what the Leader of the Opposition expects to make of this. As with his 'say one thing to one audience and another thing to another audience' approach, on this issue the Leader of the Opposition has said on some days that he would abide by the results of a plebiscite and on other days that he would not abide by the results of a plebiscite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think ordinary Australians see this for the stunt that it is. They recognise that what faces Australia now are two very different plans. The major political parties in Australia are committed to the same targets. Both sides of the House are committed to a target of a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. That percentage sounds fairly small, but it is important to remember that is against a business-as-usual case in which emissions rise substantially and in a context in which the Australian economy grows substantially. If you think of total carbon emissions per dollar of GDP, the five per cent emissions reduction target actually represents a halving of the carbon intensity in the Australian economy. So it is a target worth fighting for. It is going to make a real difference to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that, at least for now, the opposition are in the tent on that policy. The trouble is that they are in the tent in the most inefficient way. While the government are looking at the high-speed rail solution, the coalition are standing by the side of the road seeing if they can thumb a ride from anyone going by because their battered jalopy has broken down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's strategy goes directly to the problem. It goes directly to the fact that dangerous carbon pollution is causing world temperatures to rise. We have seen steady warming—there is a clear consensus among scientists that the world is warming and that humans are causing that warming. We know, for example, that in Australia each decade since World War II has been warmer than the one that preceded it. We know that sea level rises have occurred. We know that temperature rises have occurred. And we know that the pattern of temperature change is consistent with human induced warming. If you look at the different levels of the atmosphere in which the warming has taken place, what you see will be entirely consistent with what anthropogenic climate change models would predict. That means we need to go directly to the heart of the problem, and the government is doing that by pricing carbon pollution. By putting a price on carbon pollution we induce innovation in the market, we encourage entrepreneurs to make the decisions that will ensure that we as a community reduce dangerous carbon pollution to the greatest extent possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, the coalition has a 'subsidies for polluters' plan. While Labor will put in place a price on pollution and provide generous assistance to households and businesses and investment in renewables, the coalition will slug Australian households. We thought that slug would be $720 a year until the coalition said that they would not internationally link those schemes. Whereas the trend throughout the world has been international linkage of carbon pricing schemes, the coalition now has a 'go it alone' approach. That, of course, would push up the cost to households. Our estimate now is that the cost of the coalition's 'subsidies for polluters' scheme would be $1,300 for each Australian household. That would be a substantial slug, and what you would get for it would be a much less effective scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, the coalition are committed to axing the very public servants who would be needed to administer their scheme. We will encourage polluters to put in place abatement technologies and to use their fuel more effectively. We will encourage households to choose the lower carbon product on the shelf. But the coalition's direct action program, far from allowing them to scrap the department of climate change—as they have claimed—would most likely require more public servants to administer. It would most likely require an increase in personnel because, if you put in place a scheme which is straight out of central planning, you need more people to do that central planning.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen throughout this process the Prime Minister being willing to face the hard questions. The Prime Minister has constantly been willing to go out and speak to people in shopping centres and engage with people at community meetings. She has engaged with a wide cross-section of Australians. But the Leader of the Opposition has constantly been running away. He is only willing to speak to hand-picked audiences. He is only willing to speak to the party faithful.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weekends ago, after walking out of a Western Australian Liberal Party conference, which voted for a royal commission into climate science, a great embarrassment on the Liberal Party if ever there was one—one assumes the next Western Australian Liberal Party motion will be for a royal commission into the notion that Elvis is alive and well and living in Subiaco, or into whether or not the moon landing was faked—the Leader of the Opposition literally ran away from journalists. They asked him hard questions, and his car was not there to pick him up, so he had to run around the corner.</span>

The Leader of the Opposition made his way up to Dickson—my local shopping centre, where I held a mobile office last Saturday—and sought to hold a media stunt, at a local butcher. The only slight snag he ran into was that the butcher would not have a cut of it. The butcher would not let the Leader of the Opposition through the door. So the Leader of the Opposition had to drive down to the other end of Canberra—to Fyshwick—to find another butcher, who would let him in. The matter, not surprisingly, arose at the subsequent media conference—this was on 17 August—that the Leader of the Opposition put in place.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is symptomatic of the Leader of the Opposition's approach. It was noted in Twitter:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And 'Will Mr Abbott again appear on <span style="font-style:italic;">Meat the Press</span>?' Another wag noted, 'Perhaps some of his schedulers might be in for the chop.' </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But while there is much amusement to be had from the Leader of the Opposition's flips and backflips, we are dealing here with very serious issues. Those serious issues concern those of us who are serious about long-term economic reform when we see the sort of scare campaign that the Leader of the Opposition is running. On <span style="font-style:italic;">A Current Affair</span> on 1 December 2009, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'This will be a truth campaign, not a scare campaign.' But, alas, we have seen anything but. At a doorstop on 12 July the Leader of the Opposition said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the whole purpose of the carbon tax is to phase out the coal industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not true at all. We know that trade-exposed emissions-intensive industries will have generous assistance available to them. We know that the permits that will be provided will be provided for good reason: Labor has always been the party that has stood up for Australian jobs. And Labor recognises that because climate change is a global problem we will not solve anything by exporting pollution overseas. If an emitter simply moves to another country then that will not do any good for climate change. So we want to ensure that emissions do not move overseas, but we do not want to blunt the effect of the carbon price. Providing free permits prevents that: the price effect is still there but by providing the free permits we will ensure that the jobs are maintained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has said, at the Peabody Metropolitan mine on 9 June 2011:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the problem is that this mine will be one of many mines under threat if Julia Gillard's carbon tax goes ahead.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later on that occasion the Leader of the Opposition said: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A carbon tax ultimately means death to the coal industry and that's very, very bad news for the Illawarra, bad news for this mine and everyone who works here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This constant scare campaign would be one thing if it was just directed to people in this place, but Australians are busy people, they often only have a chance to get small snippets of the news—maybe a few grabs here and there—so it is not surprising that, having run a vigorous scare campaign over the past couple of years, Mr Abbott has succeeded in scaring some Australians. We have seen the effect of that in the trucks that have arrived, snarling up the traffic in my electorate this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But just because you run a scare campaign does not mean you have your facts right. Mr Abbott has said that as a result of the carbon price Whyalla will be 'wiped off the map'. He said that at a doorstop on 22 April 2011. But that is not the view of the steel companies. OneSteel is completing a $65 million upgrade of its Whyalla blast furnace to extend its working life beyond 2020. BlueScope has described the carbon price as 'a pragmatic solution to a complex problem'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had many respected voices in the industry who have recognised the importance of putting a price on carbon pollution. The value of using a market based mechanism is that if you start early then you are able to achieve least-cost abatement. As with many things in life, as the Prime Minister has noted, this will not get cheaper by putting it off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has had a multiplicity of positions on carbon pricing. In 19 July 2011 he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I've never been in favour of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that stands in stark contrast with his interview on Sky News when he said, on 29 July 2009:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also think that if you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he supported the emissions trading scheme. On 22 November 2009 on 2UE he said, 'You cannot have a climate change policy without supporting this ETS at this time.' On 2 October 2009, on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>, he said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Wentworth has noted on his blog on 7 December 2009:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">His only redeeming virtue in this remarkable lack of conviction is that every time he announced a new position to me he would preface it with "Mate, mate, I know I am a bit of a weathervane on this, but …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are increasingly realising that the Leader of the Opposition will say anything to any audience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That stands in stark contrasts to the leaders that have come before him. There are many things on which I would disagree with former prime minister John Howard but he did take seriously the challenge of carbon pollution. He commissioned work to be done on climate change and the use of market based mechanisms in the late 1990s. Former prime minister John Howard went to the 2007 election promising to implement an emissions trading scheme. The member for Wentworth, as Leader of the Opposition, continued that tradition. Why? Because sensible conservatives around the world recognise that market based solutions to environmental problems are in the great tradition of small 'l' liberalism. As a result, we on this side of the House are now the heirs to the Deakin legacy. We are the heirs to the legacy of ongoing reform. We stand for economic reform, for the long game, for focusing on solutions that will build a better Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The modern Liberal Party has simply turned into the party of no. They hate us on every issue. You can see that hate is palpable when they hold their community meetings. But ultimately they need us. The modern Liberal and National parties are no longer parties of ideologies, of belief, as they once were. They are now anti-Labor parties. They are now antireform parties. They need us because without us they stand for nothing. The definition of the modern Liberal-National Party platform these days is 'Whatever the Labor Party is for, we are against it.' They are the party of opposition, the party of denial, the party of negativity and the party of no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another party like that in world politics and that is the Tea Party. We have seen Senator Bernardi calling for an Australian Tea Party. Senator Bernardi would like to see the Tea Party imported into Australia, but we do not need a modern Tea Party because we have the Liberal and National parties willing to say anything to any audience, willing to oppose anything that this government puts forward. They have been willing to oppose so many sensible reforms over the course of this year, including reforms which they introduced. We saw the extraordinary situation earlier this year in which reforms on fuel taxation introduced by then Treasurer Peter Costello were opposed by the Liberal and National parties for the sake of a cheap headline. They decided that it was better to back economic populism rather than support economic reform that was in the long-run interests of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition is pursuing a strategy which has its antecedence in the doomsday cult leader. Doomsday cult leaders are greatly successful for a number of different reasons. The first thing a doomsday cult leader can do is offer absolutely everything to their followers: 'You want free food? I've got it. You want free wine? I've got it. You want free love? I've got it.' You can see that in the $70 billion black hole in the opposition's costings. The opposition have such a deep hole in their costings because they are willing to offer something to everybody but are never able to say where the money will come from. If you want to stand before the Australian people as an alternative government you need to identify where the savings are coming from. But, no, the opposition would rather stand up as a doomsday cult and say you can have anything you want: 'You won't have to pay for it; we'll give it all to you.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second similarity with a doomsday cult is that the opposition are predicting the end of the world. They have—like all good doomsday cult leaders—a particular date in mind. Their date is 1 July 2012. On 1 July 2012 prices will skyrocket, towns will be wiped off the map and whole industries will be destroyed. We know that none of these claims are true. We know the price effect will be 0.7 per cent of the CPI, less than one-third of the price impact of the GST. We know that generous assistance to emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries will ensure that jobs are supported. We know that the generous household assistance will ensure that Australians are able to buy the basket of goods that they currently buy. But for those running the doomsday cult it is useful to have a date on which the world will end. That is how you rally the supporters around you. You need to have a concrete moment at which the world will end and that date for the opposition is 1 July 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is just one small problem—one which is common to all doomsday cults—and that is the date eventually comes around. There is a day on which you have to look your followers in the eye and say, 'Well, it didn't quite pan out the way we said it would.' And so on 2 July 2012 the opposition will be looking their followers in the eye and trying to explain why the prices on the shelves and jobs look pretty much the way they used to. I do not think we should predict that the cult will completely fall apart. I am indebted to some work by Leon Festinger and other sociological researchers and their book <span style="font-style:italic;">When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group that Predicted the Destruction of the World</span>. They note that after the failure of events to come true groups sometimes regroup realising that as a form of coping mechanism—called dissonance reduction, a form of rationalisation—members often dedicate themselves with renewed vigour to the group's cause after a failed prophecy. They rationalise with expectation, such as the belief that their actions forestalled the disaster. I suspect we will see some of Festinger's rationalisations after 1 July 2012. But that doomsday cult leader strategy will not wash with the Australian people. They will see straight through the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:20</span>):  My goodness! The member for Fraser is clearly a man of enormous integrity—of great integrity, I would say, by the way in which he carries himself—but he has let himself down with this contribution. He had an opportunity today to show some remorse for misleading those 95,000 members of the seat of Fraser in the ACT. He had said to those people that under no circumstances would a Labor government in which he became a member introduce a carbon tax. Three weeks later the story had changed. A man of his integrity, a man of such upright standing in the ACT—a former lecturer, of all things—would surely seek to take any opportunity to clear his name, to demonstrate his integrity, to show that he was not seeking to deliberately mislead the people of Fraser. We are giving him a chance with this bill—a bill that he did not in fact address for more than 10 seconds of his 20-minute diatribe. I do not know what it was, to be honest. We have been in a parallel universe for the last 20 minutes. He did his best, yet at no stage did he grasp the opportunity that we are presenting this government to go to the people with a vote without the risk of losing government. That is what the plebiscite is all about. That is what the member for Fraser should have concerned himself with. We want to understand why this government is refusing to support this bill? What is their fear of going to the people, especially when there are no consequences from an electoral point of view? We were giving you that opportunity. If you were a man of integrity you would have taken it. You would have referred to it, you would have talked about it, you would have given us reasons other than some nonsense from centuries ago that you were referring to.</span>

The Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 in practical terms gives the government—a weak government; a characterless government; a government of no authority, no presence, no vision—a chance at least to seek to regain some modicum of trust and respectability within the community. Why is the community not listening to the leader of the government? Why have the people turned off? Why is there a crisis of confidence, which is more important? Here is your opportunity to start to restore some confidence back into the community. We have a crisis of confidence in this government. This government has created a circumstance in which only three weeks into a new term of office they betrayed the people who voted for them. They broke the trust of the people who voted for them. People thought they went to the election committed to not introducing a carbon tax. Do you think this government would have won if they had said they were going to introduce a carbon tax? Not on your nelly—there was not a prospect they would be on the government benches. They misled people to vote for them to get into government and within a matter of three weeks they had broken their word. This is an act of betrayal to the people who voted for them at the last election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has been given a chance by us to correct that great sin of betrayal that they perpetrated and this Prime Minister perpetrated—and I suspect led many people of integrity on the other side to mouth her words, to mouth her promises, to go along with the charade that this Prime Minister presented to the people before the last election—then to break it within a matter of three weeks in order to stay in government in a grubby deal done with the Greens. We have seen nothing for the last 12 months but an agenda which has been dominated by the Greens and the crossbenchers. There is not one issue that you can refer to, really, that has not been dictated by the crossbenchers and the Greens. This is a pathetic situation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are people out there who are deeply concerned. You cannot walk in the street in Melbourne where I live—or go to the airport or go anywhere in Australia—without people stopping you on the street, people you have never known, never spoken to. Even my Labor mates are saying to me: 'What can you do to get rid of that mob? What can you do to bring on an election?' At least what you can do is make sure this carbon tax—this thing which is a demonstration of the lack of empathy and identification with the problems people are facing—is nipped in the bud, that this thing is stopped in its tracks. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when the exchange rate is at a level it has never been at, at a time when half the economy is in recession and the other half booming, at a time when people are facing enormous cost of living pressures that they cannot deal with, people cannot understand for one minute that this government would persist with this idiotic carbon tax, which is dripping with intervention, dripping with socialism. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you wanted to introduce a price on carbon in a way which is going to maximise the amount of intervention in hundreds of our biggest employers, you would bring in a carbon tax. I know this. I had the shadow ministry for climate change for a year when the previous Prime Minister was working up his model. This carbon tax will morph into exactly the same model that we were presented and rejected on two occasions. In fact its absence was supported at the last election by the vote that those opposite got in their lies to the Australian people, when the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That was a cast-iron commitment. It was deliberately said. It was said again and again in the last fortnight to make sure that people understood this. If the Prime Minister had not made that commitment, this government, which hangs on by the slimmest of margins—we won 750,000 more votes, we won one more seat—would have lost. They have the crossbenchers with, again, a series of grubby commitments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Member for Fremantle, you tell me how you support this boatpeople business. You cannot sit there and tell me you are a person of integrity. So many people on the other side are people of integrity but they have been forced to succumb to the grubby betrayal of the Australian people by this Prime Minister and this government. I do not know how you hold your heads high at any stage. On so many fronts you have betrayed the Australian people. That is why we have a crisis of confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sovereign risk is associated with poor decisions. We have so many areas where there have been problems with this government: the BER, the pink batts, the health scheme. They promised to take over with a majority funding of health. All we have is mountains more bureaucrats. There was the PBS. The ink wasn't even dry on an 18-month deal and they broke it. Now we have, potentially, major new pharmaceutical companies, who spend $1 billion a year on R&amp;D, quietly taking some of that out of the country. We have people who are deeply concerned about so many other areas. The live cattle job was pathetic. The insult that has been meted out to the Indonesian people is just profound: 40 per cent of their meat supply cut off with just a letter to the Indonesian government. They have had 100 years of humiliation from colonisation and other things and what do we do? We cut off the supply of 40 per cent of their meat to all of their people with only a letter provided to them. Who do we think we are as a country? They are our biggest neighbour—with 300 million people. They are a part of our future, no matter what you think. No matter what you think, they are good people and they are going to be a very big part of our future. And what do we do? This government offends them. It is a disgrace!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are giving this government an opportunity to restore at least a very small modicum of trust and respectability by giving them a chance to have a vote which does not put their position as government in jeopardy—the position that they seem to be prepared to risk at any point. The support being given to the member for Dobell is sickening. Look at the evidence that comes out daily. Look at what we saw today from Fairfax—that he has lied; that he is a thief. Yet the Prime Minister stands up here daily and supports it. This government is causing a crisis of confidence in the Australian economy and is doing untold and long-term damage. This bill must be supported. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:30</span>):  I rise tonight to oppose this bill, the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011. It is the first bill in this place that I have had reason to speak against. Before I go into my discussion on my opposition to the bill, I just want to take issue with some of the comments that the member for Goldstein made, particularly his comment that we have no agenda. That is complete and utter nonsense. We have an agenda to improve education in this country. We have an agenda to improve health in this country. We have provided 50 per cent more funding for health in this country. We have an agenda to deal with ageing population and aged care for this country. We have an agenda for dealing with people with disabilities for this country. We have an agenda to link this country through the NBN and through improving infrastructure. We have made the most significant investment in infrastructure that has ever been made in this country. We had an agenda from 2007 onwards that saved this country from recession. You need just look at what is happening in the rest of the world, where most of the world is in very deep trouble. But here we are in Australia with low debt against GDP, five per cent unemployment and an economy that is going well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Goldstein's comments that we are 'agendaless' are complete and utter nonsense. We have an agenda to embrace the future, to position this nation for a prosperous future, through a range of mechanisms. And what do we get from the other side? Nothing; we just get no, no, no and opposition to everything that we want to do. It is the opposition that is the agenda vacuum; it is certainly not the government. We have had a very strong agenda since we have been in government. Since 2007 we have had a strong agenda that we have fulfilled, and we will have a strong agenda for the future of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am speaking against this bill because I believe it must absolutely be defeated not just because it is yet another example of the Leader of the Opposition's denial of climate change but because it also represents a very significant challenge to the nature of government in this country. I say that because this bill is not about consulting the Australian people. This bill is not about reflecting a national view on government policy. This bill is about allowing the Leader of the Opposition to conduct a push poll with a price tag of $80 million, with the tab to be picked up by the Australian taxpayer. It is also a poll that, should it not go his way, he has no intention of honouring. How do we know this? We know this because he said so himself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us tonight is just another stunt. It is another way for the Leader of the Opposition to get his name in the headlines, to continue his fear campaign, to continue to divide this nation, to continue to scare this nation and to continue to oppose everything because he has nothing positive to offer this nation. This is not leadership; this is not the bill of someone who cares about the issues or has a policy program or an agenda for the country. It is in fact the antithesis of these things. This bill actually says to the Australian people that coming up with positive policy solutions to the challenges facing Australia is just a little too difficult for the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to the agenda and statements being put forward by those opposite—some of which I suspect would be welcome in a Flat Earth Society meeting—this government has a positive and serious approach to tackling dangerous climate change. It is an approach for which this government convened a multi-party committee to get consensus on the best way to tackle this problem—a committee that those opposite refused to take part in, continuing their proud tradition in this place since the last election of opposition for the sake of opposition. It is a package which is true to Labor's core values of protecting jobs and looking after those who need protection most—low- and middle-income Australians. It is a package that will cut carbon pollution. It will drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure to ensure that generations of Australians to come enjoy the environment that so many of us have taken for granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package will see Australia's annual emissions reduced by at least 159 million tonnes in 2020. That is, as we have heard before, the equivalent of taking 45 million cars off the road. It will do this by placing a price on carbon for around 500 of this country's biggest polluters. It is a price on carbon for the 500 biggest polluters; it is not a tax on ordinary Australians. Under this package, according to Treasury modelling—and, unlike those opposite, I value the expertise of the Public Service and Treasury modelling—by 2050, $100 billion will have been invested in renewable energy; the renewable sector will have grown 17 times its current size; and 40 per cent of electricity generation will come from renewable sources. It will achieve this reduction and this investment in clean technologies while at the same time, as I said, protecting jobs and looking after low- and middle-income earners. Under our proposals, nine out of 10 households will receive assistance. People earning up to $80,000 will receive a tax cut, with the average tax cut being, I believe, at least $300. There will also be an increase to family tax benefit parts A and B and an increase in the pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our package will support jobs, and modelling shows that jobs will continue to grow, with 1.6 million more jobs by 2020. We know that some areas will need more assistance. That is why we are providing $9.2 billion over three years as part of the Jobs and Competitiveness Program, which will support local jobs and encourage investment in local technology. Then there is the $1.2 billion Clean Technology Program to support industries to become more competitive in a cleaner future, including $200 million for jobs in food processing and metal forging industries. There is also the $1.3 billion Coal Sector Jobs Package and the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan to support those industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our package is also one that takes into account the impacts on small business. As a former small business owner, this is something that is very dear to my heart. I know firsthand the issues that small business owners face, so I was pleased that the government took into account how it will impact on them. The government will extend the business instant tax write-off threshold to $6,500 to boost cash flow and help small businesses grow, invest and become more energy efficient. We will also establish a $40 million program to provide information to small business and community organisations on practical measures they can take to reduce energy costs. That is very, very important. People want to know what they can do themselves to reduce their energy costs and to reduce their carbon footprint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most importantly, small business will not be required to count their carbon output, nor will they have to fill in a single form as part of this reform package, something I know time-poor small business owners will greatly appreciate. This is just a small canvassing of the entire package; it is incredibly in-depth and it is incredibly comprehensive. It has been well thought out, considered, costed and modelled. By contrast, what do we see on the other side? We see a glib plan, the so-called Direct Action Plan, that will not achieve the bipartisan targets, that is uncosted and that will cost billions of dollars to implement, further exacerbating their already dismal attempts at good financial management of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a policy which the member for Wentworth, a former leader of those opposite, himself acknowledged was one that could be easily dropped. It is the policy of a group of people who do not really believe that climate change is real. It is the policy of people who have no desire to make hard decisions, to tackle serious problems or to lead the Australian people. How do I know this? The Leader of the Opposition said it himself. He cannot avoid the fact that he declared climate change 'absolute crap'. Anyone could be forgiven for forgetting that he said this, since his opinion changes depending on the day's headlines and the community to which he is speaking. He wants a plebiscite on a carbon price, but he will not abide by it. He believes climate change is real and humanity has made a contribution to it, but he also thinks it is crap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />I do wonder what the Leader of the Opposition actually believes in, other than playing opportunistic politics. It is very easy to play to populist rhetoric and to make the easy choices—to outline a policy that lacks substance and hope no-one notices by the time the election comes around. However, I cannot as a member of this place and in good conscience abrogate my responsibilities to tackle climate change. I will not do that; I will not abrogate my responsibilities as the Leader of the Opposition has done as a leader of his community. I will not declare before my community that I am not capable of confronting the problems— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  I rise here tonight to support the motion that has been moved which calls on the government to give the people a say. We have seen through the government's actions today that they do not want to give the Australian people a say. We have had a group of people come to Canberra from across Australia to voice their opinion, and what was the reaction they got from this government? From the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, we had, 'This has been nothing but a convoy of no consequence.' From the Leader of the Greens, we had, 'They are moaners and whingers.' What arrogance from this Labor-Greens government. It is interesting that it is the minister for transport and the Leader of the Greens who have done a double act in condemning people who came to Canberra to have a say, because this is a Labor-Greens government, and that is why we have a carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are saying that this motion is all about negativity. It is not about negativity; it is actually about saving the Prime Minister's credibility. It is giving her the option to say, 'I'm sorry; I got it wrong. I should not have deceived the Australian people before the last election. I shouldn't have misled them,' and to say to the Australian people, 'I shouldn't have spoken untruths, and I should have the courage to come before you and say, "I'm sorry that I deliberately deceived you and I want to make amends. I want to give you the chance to say whether or not you want this carbon tax."' The Prime Minister could restore some of her badly broken credibility by agreeing to this motion and allowing us to go to a referendum. The referendum would not be a political trick. It would simply ask, 'Do you support the government's plan to introduce a price on carbon to deal with climate change?' That is a fairly reasonable, sensible question. I do not think anyone could say that it is any way politically loaded. The Prime Minister could restore her credibility by putting that question to the Australian people and by saying: 'I know you're angry. I know that you will drive thousands and thousands of miles across the country to come here to Canberra to say "give us a say". We won't treat you with contempt. We won't call you a convoy of no consequence, a bunch of moaners and whingers. We'll give you more respect than that. We'll give you the respect that you deserve. We will give you a say. We'll admit that we misled you, that we deceived you, that we deliberately told you something before an election and then did the exact opposite after the election.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a real shame that, once again, the government will not take up this very positive contribution to political debate in this country. This is a positive contribution because it is giving the Prime Minister a chance to say: 'I'm sorry; I shouldn't have deceived you. I am now going to do the right thing.' The people in my electorate of Wannon want her to do that, because everything they learn about this carbon tax worries them to the bone. The operators of our regional airline are saying that this is going to have real consequences for their business because they cannot pass the costs on to the people who fly on their airline. They are going to have to absorb the costs, and they are struggling as it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can give you the example of two regional manufacturers in the town of Ararat who are actually doing things to reduce their carbon emissions, manufacturing equipment that leads to a reduction in emissions. Gason are producing seeders which seed directly into the earth so they require only minimum tillage. What is this government's response to manufacturers of technology that reduces emissions? They are going to be hit with more costs and they will not be able to compete with imports from Canada or China. AME Systems are doing the same for Kenworth trucks, providing technology that reduces emissions. What is the government's response to them? It is to hit them with more costs, which, once again, make it harder for them to compete with the manufacturing of this equipment that is occurring in China. What sort of government responds to manufacturing industries who are producing and providing low-emission technology by saying, 'We're going to put your costs up'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at our farmers, who are competing with the high Australian dollar, who have to export. What is going to happen to them? A dairy farmer in my electorate will face a minimum cost of between $5,000 and $7,000. It is more likely to be in the $10,000 to $15,000 range, but at a minimum between $5,000 and $7,000 will be the annual costs put on their business—and they have to compete internationally. For grain growers on the average farm, there will be $36,000 of additional costs. What about our meat processors? It will be an extra 24c to 30c per carcass. These are the additional costs being put on our rural industries. They have nowhere to go; they have to absorb them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These people want a voice. They want a say. When they voted in the last election, they did not think they were voting for a government that would put additional costs on them. They did not know that they were choosing a government that was going to put extra costs on their business, because the Prime Minister had said quite plainly, and it has never, ever been disputed:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been all sorts of Houdini-like twists to try and get out of that, but that is the language that was used and those are the words that were spoken. There has been talk along the lines of 'It was a different parliament from the one beforehand' and 'We had to form government, so of course what I said before the election doesn't count; it's what I said after.' What a load of hogwash. It was very clear what the Prime Minister said before the last election, and it is very clear what she is doing now.</span>

That is what we are here discussing tonight—why they should be given that choice; why they should be able to vote in a plebiscite on a very simple question: 'Do you support the government's plan to introduce a price on carbon to deal with climate change?' It is not a trick question; it is a very simple one. I know the people of my electorate want the chance to vote—</span>

Once again, you can look them in the eye and know that, when they say something, what they are saying is the honest truth.' Sadly, at the moment, the office of Prime Minister is being undermined on a daily basis by the fact that the Prime Minister said one thing before the election and did another thing after. This is her chance to redeem the office of Prime Minister in this country. I hope those opposite will take that chance and vote for this motion.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:51</span>):  On a day when 1,000 workers in New South Wales and Victoria received the horrible news that they are potentially about to lose their jobs at BlueScope, and at a time when the region and the globe are grappling with enormous political difficulties, terrible instability and some really big challenges, it is very unfortunate that here in the national parliament, the place where all of our electors expect both sides to come and engage in serious debates about serious issues, we are bogged down in a ridiculous debate about a political stunt. It comes from a bloke who over the last 12 months of this parliament has engaged in more stunts than Evil Knievel in his entire life as a daredevil and a stuntman. He runs around the country in search of glowing vests and funny hats. There is not a small business in the country whose premise he will not terrorise in the hope of a media opportunity. Today we saw him attempting to bolster the numbers in something called a cavalcade or a convoy or some such thing in some attempt to blockade Parliament House and terrorise the residents of Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here is an $80 million stunt, and I can tell you the people in my electorate, the electorate of Throsby in New South Wales, could come up with a lot better use for $80 million. I know those on the other side do not like school buildings, but $80 million would build around 80 libraries and school halls, science labs and language labs—that is about one for every high school in my electorate. That $80 million would go a long way to building much needed infrastructure to provide more hospital beds, and more doctors and nurses in my electorate, but those on the other side of the chamber suggest that that $80 million would be better spent on a political stunt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it is a political stunt and it is all about the politics of no. It comes from the champion of no who launched himself on the political stage championing Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, whose first act as a political player in this country was to ensure that we live for another decade or so as a constitutional monarchy and not have the opportunity to reach full independence as a republic. The next mission—and I find this one really interesting—of the champion of no, deputised by his political godfather, the former Prime Minister, was to destroy Pauline Hanson, the former member for Oxley. He set himself off on that task and did a pretty good job of it, which I am sure is something that irks her enormously. It has always struck us as rather strange on this side of the House that, after he spent a year or so engaged in the task of destroying Pauline Hanson, he has spent the last 12 months in this parliament attempting to emulate her. When you pull out all of the policies, all of the populism and all of the ideas that he has brought before this parliament, you are reading from the One Nation playbook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bloke whose answer to everything is no, so it comes as no surprise to those of us on this side of the House that, the day after he proposes this stunt to the Australian people—this plebiscite that he wants to spend $80 million on—and before the vote has been held, he has already pronounced his verdict on the outcome of that plebiscite. He has told the people of Australia it does not matter what they say. He will reject it—this is the champion of no. So whatever the Australian people say in this proposed plebiscite, the Leader of the Opposition's answer is no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that in politics the issue is all about the question you ask. Further evidence of the stunt is in the question itself, because they had an option. They could quite easily have put up a bill that said that, given that we both have the same bipartisan target on reducing our carbon emissions—that is, five per cent over 2000 levels by 2020—and a bipartisan position on the contribution of renewable energy to that reduction in carbon emissions, and I know there are many on that side of the House who do not agree with that bipartisan proposition, it would have been very easy for the Leader of the Opposition to propose a question that said something like this: should we reduce our emissions in the most cost-effective way? That would have been a bona fide question to put in your plebiscite bill, wouldn't it?</span>

If he had any bona fides, the champion of no could have put a question to this parliament and to the Australian people in his draft bill: should we reduce our bipartisan target; should we reduce our emissions in the most cost-effective way?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Leader of the Opposition and those that follow in his cavalcade of no do not have the guts to put that proposition, because then we would have to engage in a debate about the costings. A debate about the costings would enable all Australians to see that the coalition's plan, the subsidies for big polluters plan, is in fact a tax on every Australian household to the tune of $1300 per annum. You will not see that in any of their propaganda. You will not see that in any of their speeches, but the fact of the matter is that, if we engaged in a debate about the most cost-effective way of reducing our bipartisan position on carbon emissions, we would be putting up our proposition, which puts a charge on the biggest polluters in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions. We will reduce those emissions by five per cent by 2020. We will see that theirs is a tax on every Australian household of $1,300 per annum, contributing to the $70 billion black hole in their budget costings.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they were fair dinkum, they would put that question to the Australian people, but they are not fair dinkum. They know that all they are engaged in is a political stunt with a predetermined outcome. They will say no because that is all they know how to do on that side of the House. We are engaged in a serious debate about how we can reduce our carbon pollution in this country and play our part in an international effort to reduce carbon pollution to stave off dangerous climate change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a dark cloud hanging over the Reserve Bank of Australia that only the government can remove. Saying hardly a word, the Treasurer has allowed this dark cloud to grow and cover ever more of the landscape. As a result, Australia's central bank sits with its governance under question. It is now time for the Prime Minister to step in and restore public confidence in the Reserve Bank with a full and independent inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely essential in a democracy for the public to have confidence in the integrity and appropriate governance of our public institutions. In a market economy, it is particularly crucial that there is the same confidence in the key institutions that are tasked with managing the economy. That is what makes the recent allegations of involvement in bribery against two Reserve Bank subsidiaries, Securency and Note Printing Australia, all the more concerning. The more that is revealed about the bank note scandal, the more it appears that serious questions about corporate governance at the Reserve Bank need to be answered. It is also clear that questions need to be answered by the government, particularly with regard to Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to review briefly some of what has been disclosed about this whole affair. According to reports by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>, the leadership of the RBA failed to notify the police of evidence that it had as far back as 2007 that its subsidiary Note Printing Australia was involved with the bribery of foreign officials. The NPA board, which included former and current RBA board members or officials, was provided information in 2007 that company agents were bribing officials in Malaysia and Nepal, according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>. After being alerted to bribery concerns by the NPA board, the Reserve Bank leadership decided to handle the matter internally rather than notify the police. The Australian Federal Police were not told about these allegations regarding the NPA until May 2009, about two years later, and only after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> exposed corruption concerns at the other RBA company, Securency. This is despite the RBA's chief auditor finding serious problems with NPA's use of agents and his findings being examined by the bank's audit committee, according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To get to the nub of it, we are talking about tens of millions of dollars of public money. Both of the RBA's companies have now been charged with conspiracy to bribe foreign officials and a number of executives have also been charged. Yet the RBA is still to explain what and when it knew and how its oversight of these two companies could be so flawed as to allow this to happen. Most importantly—and this is crucial—we must get to the bottom of why it appears that the RBA failed for so long to notify police of the serious evidence of wrongdoing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredible to me that, in spite of these serious allegations of corruption and bribery and the breakdown in accountability and governance, the government and, in particular, the Treasurer have remained almost mute about the problem. It is the Australian Greens' view that the government can no longer be silent on this matter and it is time for action. The Prime Minister should establish a full and independent inquiry that has the powers it needs to get to the bottom of what has occurred, and it needs to look at everyone involved, including the Reserve Bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am moving this motion to make clear parliament's view that the government cannot ignore this problem and must establish such an inquiry. I want to make clear that in moving this motion there is no suggestion on our part that the AFP is not doing its job in investigating and bringing charges. This inquiry will not cut across the AFP's work because the inquiry's focus will be on the failure of governance within the RBA, something the AFP investigation does not necessarily have as its focus. This is not about undermining the Reserve Bank; it is the opposite—because now, more than ever, given the global financial instability, it is vital that public confidence in the Reserve Bank is restored. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  I am certainly pleased to have the opportunity to rise to speak on the matter of the Reserve Bank of Australia board and, in particular, its subsidiaries, Securency and Note Printing Australia. I note that this motion has been put forward by the Australian Greens. When you go to the heart of this matter, it is a call by the Australian Greens for there to be a full-blown inquiry into what the Reserve Bank knew, when they knew and what they did about it. However, the matters at the core of this issue, dealing with Reserve Bank board governance with respect to Securency and Note Printing Australia, are matters that I, as a member and Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, have already asked the Reserve Bank Governor himself about at two inquiries that the economics committee has conducted with the Reserve Bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no doubt that the issues and the allegations at the core of this matter are substantial. There can be no doubt that, when it comes to corrupt practices such as paying bribes to foreign officials, this is the kind of matter that ought to be dealt with very firmly. When these allegations were first raised with me, off the back of some very fine investigative work by a number of journalists, that was part of the reason I took it upon myself to ask some hard questions of the Reserve Bank Governor. It is beholden upon all of us in this place to make sure that we walk the fine line between allowing transparency and asking difficult questions on hard topics while not allowing matters to become partisan politics purely and simply because it suits certain agendas at certain times. So in good faith I put to the Reserve Bank governor a number of questions in 2010 and subsequently at hearings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. We know that the time line is not as apparent as the mover of the motion put it. Certainly, it would suit these conveniences of the Greens to argue that there is a large conspiracy and a cover-up—and, in fact, we know there were corrupt officials being paid inappropriately by Australian agencies—but the truth is that it is simply not that clear-cut. Where the evidence tends to indicate that there may be a prima facie basis to support the assertion of a conspiracy and a cover-up, charges have been laid. The AFP is investigating the conduct at the core of this. They are investigating it in a way that is not beholden to party political process or prone to grandstanding but rather in a way that is focused upon discerning the truth—something that I fear is not at the core of the Greens motion on Securency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one area on which I do agree with the Greens on this matter—that is, that a full and frank account is owed to the Australian people by the Treasurer. The reason I say it is owed by the Treasurer is that under evidence from the Reserve Bank Governor we know that the first time that information was transmitted from the Reserve Bank to the executive arm of government occurred under his watch as Treasurer of the country. That was the first time that this Labor Treasurer—or, indeed, any executive member of the parliament that we know of—was informed about some of the practices that had taken place and whether or not these practices were appropriate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In defence of aspects of the activities of the Reserve Bank, it is clear to me, based upon the evidence that I have been given in answers from the Reserve Bank Governor and my own reading of, for example, the audit by KPMG and the evidence from Rick Battellino and others, that shortly after the AWB scandal the Reserve Bank board instructed that there be a thorough review of the practices and policies of NPA—that is, Note Printing Australia—and Securency in their use of offshore agents. Although the headline figures that the Greens used sound controversial, they were not inconsistent with a business of this size. The findings of that review made a number of recommendations. In some instances the use of agents was ceased, and in others it was continued. But there was a breakdown of management controls, and that is part of what AFP investigation has gone too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the fullness of time, a thorough political investigation may be the prudent thing to do; but right now is not the prudent thing to do. There is an AFP investigation. Charges have been laid. It is not the time for political grandstanding; it is time for the AFP to do their work. It may, however, be the appropriate time once the Treasurer has given account.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:10</span>):   In speaking to this motion, I say from the outset that I totally understand and accept the concern put up by the member for Melbourne to explain why he is raising this issue. I do not, however, accept and support his motion. The motion and the issue relate to the activity of the banknote marketing company Securency. Securency is half owned by the Reserve Bank of Australia and half owned by UK plastic film manufacturer Innovia. Securency was formed in 1996 to commercialise polymer banknote printing technology that had been jointly developed by the Reserve Bank of Australia and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO. I think it is great to think that the CSIRO was involved in the development of the banknotes that are now being used by countries in other parts of the world. In order to win banknote supply contracts between 1999 and 2005 the marketing of the new design of these polymer banknotes began. If a contract is won, I understand that Note Printing Australia, a company 100 per cent owned by the RBA, manufactures the bank notes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The prosecutions currently underway are the first under Australia's foreign bribery legislation introduced in 1999, and that in itself is quite significant—prosecutions are currently underway based on an act of parliament that was introduced 12 years ago, and this is the first time that it has been used. I understand that six former Securency officials have been charged with offences relating to bribing public officials in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria. I understand further that Malaysian authorities have laid bribery charges against two individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These matters are currently before the courts, and I would expect that the matters are also currently under continuing Australian Federal Policy inquiry. It is my view, and I believe it would be the government's view, that these matters are being properly investigated across international jurisdictions—and, in fact, charges have been laid. To widen the investigation, as the motion proposes, with powers equivalent to a royal commission whilst court proceedings are underway would in my view be inappropriate, regardless of whether it was to be an investigation conducted by a member or former member of the judiciary, by another suitable person or even by a committee of this parliament</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Moncrieff has said, it may be appropriate to widen the investigation subsequent to the court outcomes, but it is not appropriate in the midst of court proceedings. In response to the member for Moncrieff's criticism of the Treasurer, I point out to the House that the alleged offences took place between 1999 and 2005—that is, prior to this government's coming to office and under the watch of the previous coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note, as other members who have spoken have noted, that in 2007 the Reserve Bank of Australia engaged corporate law firm Freehills to carry out a confidential probe of the activities in question. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, Freehills found no breach of Australian law involving Note Printing Australia. Of course, we have not seen that advice and we rely on the Reserve Bank's response in respect to it. I further note that since 2008—that is, subsequent to the matters before the courts—Securency and Note Printing Australia have both had a change of chairmanship; the Reserve Bank of Australia's Assistant Governor, Dr Rob Rankin, is now the chairperson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Melbourne referred to today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> newspaper, where a story by Richard Baker and Nick McKenzie in which allegations of bribery associated with 2002 and 2004 note printing contracts for the Nepalese government by Note Printing Australia appear. I understand that the Australian Federal Police is also investigating that matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a serious matter—any allegation of corruption or bribery is serious—and it is reflected by the penalties associated with the matter. However, I say to the member for Melbourne, 'Let us wait to see what the court outcome is before we take this matter further.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:15</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion regarding bank note bribery allegations. I would like to congratulate my colleague, Steven Ciobo, who asked a series of questions about this very issue during a recent House of Representatives committee hearing with the Reserve Bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the role of the Reserve Bank is a critical one. The Reserve Bank of Australia is Australia's central bank. It conducts monetary policy, it works to maintain a strong financial system and it issues the nation's currency. It is a policy making body, and that policy making body has serious responsibilities. It provides selected banking and registry services to a range of Australian government agencies and to a number of overseas central banks and official institutions. It also manages Australia's gold and foreign exchange reserves. Any question as to the propriety of the Reserve Bank is a very serious one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question at the fore today relates to two subsidiaries of the Reserve Bank: Securency, 50 per cent owned by the Reserve Bank; and Note Printing Australia, 100 per cent owned by the Reserve Bank. There have been a number of allegations that have been ventilated in the media over a period of time. At the core of the issues that have been raised is the use of agents and those agents making payments, or bribes, to secure contracts overseas. This is currently under police investigation. However, there are still questions around who knew what, when they knew it and what they then did about it. It would be a serious issue indeed if the RBA did not have appropriate governance standards to identify any potential breaches of the law. It would be a critical issue indeed for the RBA if in fact it was made aware of issues and did not immediately refer those issues to the police for investigation. It would be a serious issue if the RBA tried to deal with this matter internally. It would be a serious issue if the RBA did not notify the government when it became aware of the concerns regarding allegations of bribery of foreign officials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thinking back on some of the recent matters that have involved allegations of foreign bribes, I recall Kevin Rudd making quite a lot of noise about these issues in 2005. In fact, he had quite a lot to say about it. He said it was most critical that in circumstances where these sorts of allegations are made they should be properly and thoroughly investigated. In fact, he indicated that, foreign bribes were associated with the 'worst corruption scandal in Australia's history'. The government needs to look very seriously at the position it is taking on this issue today compared with the position that it has taken it the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, before the Greens' member for Melbourne there was Steven Ciobo. He has done quite a lot of forensic work on this issue in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics in his pursuit of questioning of the Reserve Bank Governor. He asked a series of questions during the last meeting. Specifically, he asked when the Reserve Bank was made aware of these issues. The Reserve Bank Governor said in his response that he was first made aware of the issues in relation to Securency in May 2009, which is when the reports were first publicly ventilated. However, according to recent media reports, it seems that the board was aware of issues relating to the sister company, Note Printing Australia, in May 2007. So there are some serious issues to be properly investigated and looked at. I note that there is going to be a committee hearing of the Reserve Bank on Friday and I am sure that these questions will be addressed during that hearing. It is imperative that the police are able to get on with their investigation. This is critical. The government should not stand in the way of any police investigation. The police should be able to go about their business and to secure the information that they need in order to do their job properly and thoroughly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion of the member for Melbourne, which calls for this House to establish an independent inquiry into the 'bank note bribery scandal concerning the Reserve Bank of Australia, Securency and Note Printing Australia'. The motion suggests that such an inquiry should have powers equivalent to a royal commission. This is a serious call indeed, and one that this House should think about carefully before endorsing. It is a matter of record that serious allegations have been made, but it is also worth noting, as previous speakers in this debate have done, that the Reserve Bank has conducted internal reviews which found no wrongdoing on the part of any RBA staff or RBA appointed board members of Securency. The matter is also under investigation by the Australian Federal Police, and it might therefore be thought appropriate for this House not to step into a space which is already occupied by a police investigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great irony that one of the great Australian inventions that we often point to, the polymer bank note—which, alongside the black box, is often regarded as one of Australia's great innovations—should be caught up in an apparent scandal like this. It is important to recognise the statements the Reserve Bank of Australia have made concerning the scandal which, as previous members have noted, arose in 1999 to 2005. By coincidence, that is around the same period the AWB scandal was occurring that the member for Higgins referred to. The Reserve Bank of Australia noted in a statement on 1 July this year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">None of the individuals charged now has any connection with the companies or with the Reserve Bank. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No one in the Reserve Bank has been accused of wrongdoing, nor have any members of the company boards who were drawn from the Reserve Bank. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank's statement also noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Over the past several years much has been done to tighten controls and strengthen governance so as to avoid any re-occurrence of the alleged behaviour: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Those charged with offences are no longer with the companies; </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The use of sales agents has ceased;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Policies and procedures at both companies have been thoroughly overhauled; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Reserve Bank added executive resources in the banknotes area and moved to draw all its appointees to the boards of both companies from the Bank's executive or the Reserve Bank Board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank statement ended by noting that it would not make further comments about the charges as they were now to be tested in the courts. Similarly, this House should wait and see the results of those police investigations before putting in place an investigation of our own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely critical that we recognise the context in which we are having this conversation. Amidst some global turmoil on US and European markets, Australia has extraordinarily strong economic fundamentals, one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world, one of the lowest levels of government debt in the developed world, and strict fiscal rules and strong banks. In the Asian century we are located in the fastest-growing region of the world, deeply enmeshed in the economies of Asia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true, of course, that a high dollar puts pressure on certain sectors, Dutch disease puts pressure on manufacturing, domestic tourism and our higher education sector, which is reliant on overseas students. But it is important when we are discussing matters such as the Reserve Bank and the conduct of monetary policy in Australia not to forget the fundamental economic environment in which we find ourselves. Ours is a position that almost any developed country in the world would be glad to trade places with. Both the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank governor note that when they attend international meetings virtually any colleague around the world would be happy to trade places with them. So it is in that strong economic context that this conversation is occurring.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:25</span>):  I am pleased to rise to speak on this motion proposed by the member for Melbourne that there ought to be a royal commission into the question of the allegations which have been made concerning the Reserve Bank of Australia and its subsidiaries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue before the House this evening is not whether serious allegations have been raised about the conduct of individuals involved with the Reserve Bank or its subsidiaries. It is true that serious allegations have been raised. The issue is not whether the Reserve Bank of Australia or its subsidiaries should comply with the law. Of course they ought to comply with the law, be that in Australia or in any other jurisdiction around the world in which that organisation, its subsidiaries or its officials or executives are operating. The issue is not whether there is a need for this matter to be investigated. If allegations of this degree of seriousness have been made and have been reported then clearly there is a need for them to be investigated. The issue is not whether on this side of the House we take this matter very seriously. Clearly, we do take this matter very seriously and, as the House has already been informed, the member for Moncrieff has been assiduous in pursuing this matter in the House Standing Committee on Economics, asking a number of questions about it because it does raise a very serious question of public interest. The issue is not whether the Reserve Bank of Australia is a major economic institution in this country. Of course the Reserve Bank of Australia is an institution of the very first importance to economic management and to the economic security that Australians rightly expect the government to provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue before the House, which is encapsulated in the notion that we are considering, is a far more narrow and precise issue. It is this: what is the right process to investigate and to pursue the allegations which have been made? As the House is well aware, this matter is being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. I emphasise that on this side of the House we make no comment about the merits of that process and of course all individuals involved are entitled to the presumption of innocence. I simply make the point that there is a process being carried on as we speak by a federal government agency, the Australian Federal Police, in relation to the allegations which have been made and so therefore, against that backdrop, the question before this House tonight is a very simple, clear one: is there a case to overlay that process which is presently underway with an entirely new and separate process, the process embodying and involving a royal commission?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A royal commission ought not to be set up lightly. There is a high bar that must be met before any government should commence to establish a royal commission. There must be a demonstrated view that the existing mechanisms for investigating the matter are inadequate. There must be a justification. There must be a basis for granting the coercive powers which royal commissions typically have. Royal commissions typically have the capacity to deal with witnesses in a way which denies them many rights of procedural fairness that are available to a witness in an ordinary traditional judicial proceeding. If you are to set that higher standard, if you are to establish a body with these out of the ordinary powers, you need to demonstrate that there is a case to do that and that the established processes are not sufficient, are not adequate, to deal with the allegations which have been made. You have to do more than say that there are serious questions which need to be investigated. You have to demonstrate that the existing processes of investigation which, as the House is aware, involve the Australian Federal Police are not adequate. The simple point I make is that that has not been demonstrated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="9K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms GAMBARO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:30</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to enlighten the House about my recent activities with organisations and individuals who are making a big difference to the City of Brisbane. I was delighted to have Senator Mitch Fifield, the shadow minister for disability services, come to host a disability forum in Brisbane recently. I thank the senator. I was very pleased with the turnout and the feedback that we received in this very important area. We heard many stories of dedication and commitment. We unfortunately heard many stories of the current system of disability support that is broken. The coalition recognises that people with disabilities, their carers and their families deserve a better deal. We support the NDIS. Along with the heart-warming stories we heard, we were also told about the woeful state of disability services in Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland's disability service is probably one of the worst in the country. It is an embarrassment and we must do more. We heard stories of a completely dysfunctional system that places a great deal of reliance on service standards compliance that proves to be a waste of time and money. This money could be used to improve the lives of Queenslanders with disabilities. It is estimated that some $500 million is spent each year by the not-for-profit sector just on regulatory compliance. Additionally the government has stopped listening to those who know what needs to be done. We hear examples of consultation processes with key stakeholders that occur after the policy has been decided, and those people really feel that they are not being listened to. I would like to thank two of my constituents, Mrs Ursula Agnew and Michelle Lawson, who was instrumental in arranging this forum. They have firsthand knowledge of the effort and commitment required to care for kids with disabilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day following the forum, the senator and I had the privilege of attending the Red Hill Special School for a disability tea. The event was to raise awareness of a national disability insurance scheme and the campaign to make every Australian count. I would like to highlight the great work being done at the Red Hill Special School and in particular Ms Cath McCulloch, the occupational therapist at the Red Hill Special School. I would also like to thank the principal, Pam Stack, and her entire staff for their hospitality and the terrific work being undertaken at the school. The school was established in 1986 to provide specifically for the educational needs of school aged people with multiple disabilities. An early special education class was established in 1995 and it was extended to cater for local children with a broad range of special educational needs in 1999. The programs cater for children and students from birth to 17 or 18 years of age, and approximately 50 children from birth to five years access the early childhood development program. There are roughly 40 kids of six to 17 years of age enrolled in the same school. Those early intervention programs are vital to the development of children with disabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I was very pleased to visit a great organisation making a really positive impact on the lives of Queenslanders. Community in Bardon were instrumental in helping the people of Brisbane in the aftermath of the floods earlier this year. However, they do much more than that. Some of their services include aged and disability services, child care, community development, community education, emergency relief and settlement services. They have been working so hard in the community for over 30 years to develop and deliver locally based services and activities in response to the issues and opportunities that life can present. Their mission is to strengthen the communities' capacity by responding to the diverse needs and interests of their members. Community utilise an integrated recovery focused approach to assist people experiencing long-term mental health issues. This was why I was very pleased to meet with the manager, Ms Karen Dare. I was told by the managers that there are large numbers of families who are coming to them for financial assistance, particularly to pay bills and for food and clothing. I thank Senator Fifield for his time in Brisbane and his commitment to disability services. I also applaud the fantastic work that is being done at the Red Hill Special School and, particularly, the fantastic work that is being done in community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BV5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ADAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:35</span>):  I want to continue the speech in which I was so rudely interrupted in quorum calls today by the silly opposition in this parliament. I think it is really a bad thing for the opposition to play political games when backbenchers are trying to make their contribution to the House. It is very disrespectful to the House and to the people of Australia. I want to continue on the schools assistance legislation and why it is so important to Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to talk about the importance of small schools in country areas. I was talking about how technology has improved the opportunities for small country schools and how they have so many opportunities for both classwork and the extras such as sport, music and other activities. In Tasmania, where a cluster system has worked quite well in the past, many of these schools interact on sports days—football matches, hockey and netball, all with the strong involvement of parents, teachers and the local community. There is a growing body of evidence that small schools can and do deliver comprehensive education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The assumption used in Tasmania to justify small schools' closures—the economies of scale argument often advanced—is that reduction of expenditure per pupil would translate into greater public pupil achievement because the money saved could be invested in school improvement. However, where there have been closures in other countries, there is no evidence to support this finding. There is, in fact, a growing body of research that, far from seeking to defend the retention of small schools, actually seeks to examine the success of small schools. In general this research points to the human scale of small schools, the satisfied and willing cohort of pupils, socially independent school leavers transferring to post-primary schools, committed teachers, the opportunity for parents to exercise choice of school that numbers of small schools typically afford, relative autonomy and distance from bureaucracy, excellent responses to the local community and a good school-pupil and school-family match.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial concerns taken in isolation might present a potential argument for some in favour of the amalgamation or closure of small schools, but it is important that such argument be counterbalanced by other considerations such as the adverse effect of children being bussed to different environments; the sociological importance of rural schools in the community; its role in the preservation of memories of local families and local history, culture, folklore; its significance in the pride of the town; and the attachment of the people to the school. There is also the small business effect: who is going to deliver the newspapers and who is going to run errands around the local shop? Who is around to pack groceries in the store on school holidays? In Tasmania these tend to be done by secondary school students. Many who come from country towns will return at weekend to that town if their childhood links are there. As mentioned previously, small schools can assist in change—not only changes in education but also changes in their communities—that can be just as good as economic drivers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To get back to the bill before the parliament, the national curriculum provides an advantage to these small schools because once again they can be part of the national scheme by providing education, as they are now linked to almost anywhere in the world. Rounding up a pile of small schools into one is not going to improve their educational outcomes. It will merely remove the driving force of the community and lose its direction and pride. With the huge investment that Labor has put into schools it has become possible to change the face of education. In the new funding rounds government will oversee the rollout of the first phase of the $69.1 million Empowering Local Schools initiative to a thousand schools in 2012 and 2013, giving school communities more say in decision making. I hope we might be able to obtain and use some of that money to allow Lyons' small schools to develop their future sustainability and ensure their continuation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:40</span>):  In September 1921 a World War I veteran by the name of Charles Halliday Engisch, established an independent community newspaper. As a resident of the Bennelong suburb of Gladesville, Charles became a strong, passionate and vocal fighter for his local community and was enduringly proud of his paper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Times</span>. He was a foundation member of the Gladesville RSL sub-branch and served as its president and volunteered his time on numerous community organisations, including as first patron of the Gladesville and District Junior Cricket Association for an astonishing 47 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charles worked tirelessly on his paper and every Thursday morning he would take the first tram to his brother Leslie's printing press in Bankstown and carry all 4,000 copies of the week's edition back to the Gladesville community for distribution. In 1971, just a few months short of the 50th anniversary of his paper, which remained fiercely independent and renowned for its impartiality, Charles Engisch passed away at the age of 77. Ownership remained with the family as his son-in-law Earl Ware took over the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Times</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1979 a local champion, with a ceaseless grin and ink in his veins, by the name of John Francis Booth became the new owner and standard bearer of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Times</span>. JB as he is known to all had served on the local council and launched an ombudsman campaign in 1964 with the strong support of Charles Engisch. JB said, 'Like the Remington man, I liked the product so much that I not only bought one issue of the paper but the whole company!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty years since this decision I am proud to call JB a friend and am delighted to next week join him in celebrating the 90th anniversary of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Times</span>. Charles Engisch may have been <span style="font-style:italic;">TWT</span>'s founder and its reason for being, but after 32 years John Booth has cemented himself as the lifeblood and the heart and soul of this community paper. JB holds high the paper's traditions and values of independence and maintains a patriotic local focus, including a fearlessly one-eyed dedication to the mighty Wests Tigers. His achievement in keeping the <span style="font-style:italic;">TWT</span> so successful is even more impressive when one considers the strength of his competition: the Murdoch and Fairfax empires. In this environment of big business, big money and the constant struggle for print advertising dollars in an increasing online world, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Times</span> remains free with a circulation of 54,000 across the Bennelong region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JB is ably helped by a team of dedicated workers and volunteers with Ulrike Eichmeyer, Greg Turner, Chris Karas and Ruth Lesslie to name a few. Their efforts and passion for their community and paper have led to the <span style="font-style:italic;">TWT</span> being conferred a string of awards over the past decade. Every week, the editorial 'JB's World' lists the seemingly endless array of family members, friends and colleagues celebrating milestones on that particular week as well as paying tribute to community volunteers and heroes who have passed on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JB is dedicated to his Scouts, the region's heritage and broader community issues, regularly hosting public forums in his offices. JB richly deserves the Order of Australia honour he received in 1976 in recognition of his service to the community and the Centenary Medal in 2001, which paid tribute to his contributions to Scouting and the media. Yet despite all the awards and the service and the great local paper that I look forward to receiving each Wednesday, the most enduring and enamouring aspect to JB is the enthusiasm with which he stays true to his editorial by-line, the simple philosophy: keep smiling. There is no doubt that next Friday night, as the local community gathers at TWT headquarters, JB will have a smile from ear to ear and from beer to beer. As the representative of the people of Bennelong, I thank and congratulate JB, Ulrike and all of the team for a wonderful achievement.</span>

At every opening the teachers, support staff, parents and students could not have been more supportive or appreciative of the federal government's investment in education. The government's record investment in Australian skills has delivered modern facilities to schools across the nation. The formula used has been used in every single one of the 150 electorates across the nation, irrespective of whether they are Labor, Liberal, Independent or National. In the Banks electorate a total of $85,236,722 has been expended through the three key programs: Primary Schools for the 21st Century, National School Pride Program, and Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools. Padstow TAFE received $406,446 under the Better TAFE Facilities program.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally I have seen and experienced the difference that the new and upgraded classrooms have made to our schools, in addition to the COLAs—covered outdoor learning areas—the multipurpose halls, the walkways, the new toilets and sewerage systems, the new libraries, the playground upgrades and all the other facilities in our schools. I know the opposition continues to bleat in sound bites over expenditure on these projects. I say this to those on the other side: you could never have had the vision to complete such a scheme. A nation-building enterprise such as this had some problems, but to put this into perspective, of the 23,670 construction projects, there were 332 complaints, of which 326 have now been resolved. I know that the various facilities will be used by the school and by the broader community. The government's objectives in this were to provide schools with the largest capital input ever experienced as well is to provide support for local businesses. This program ensured that jobs were maintained and created in a very difficult financial situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard from not only tradesman but architects, surveyors, landscapers and so many others who were able to gain employment or remain employed because of this initiative. When you multiply that by the over 23,000 school based projects across the nation you can see why we fared so well during the global financial crisis and why we are the envy of economies around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to recognise the commitment of all school communities in my electorate who helped make these developments possible. Without the cooperation of principals, teachers, support staff, families and local workers these schools would not have had the 21st century facilities they so richly deserve and now enjoy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I do not apologise for the fact that I am a Keynesian. Indeed, because this money that was injected into the community, when you look at the multiplier effect—which if you read the economic textbooks is about four times what you spend—we have a situation where in the life of this government we have had 750,000 jobs created since the government was elected and about 350,000 of those jobs were created during the global financial crisis. Instead of tax cuts what we have had through the schools programs and indeed through the social housing programs is infrastructure that will, in effect, re-infuse the local communities where that work was done. That is what I have experienced as I have gone around my electorate. There are schools like East Hills Girls High School, now in the member for Hughes's electorate and formerly in my electorate before the last election. That school will get over $10 million to, in effect, reinvigorate the school. Just last week under another program, which was funded by the former state government, we opened a large gymnasium. The member for Hughes was there and he saw how that school had been reinvigorated. It was a school built in the fifties and sixties and was, like so many in my electorate, badly in need of funds. It took a global financial crisis for the government to spend the sort of money that it spent. Under the Building the Education Revolution it spent $16.2 billion. In my opinion it was money well spent. Of course some builders ripped us off. Of course some builders did well out of it. Who has not had a bad experience with a builder? But the positives far outweigh the negatives. As I said when we were opening one presentation, 97 per cent is not a bad result. I would not mind getting that at school. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VASTA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  I rise tonight to inform the House of my office's idea to raise extra funds for the victims of the flood in Brisbane. As I have stated before, after the flood that so devastated the great city of Brisbane, my office and I wanted to do something special to raise money for the victims of the flood and to support the city of Brisbane. Like many fellow Brisbane residents, I was so impressed with how the Brisbane City Council under Campbell Newman rose to the challenge, mobilising thousands of volunteers to put Brisbane back together. As such the Lord Mayor's Community Disaster Relief Appeal Fund was the obvious benefactor for this great initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Knowing that so many people across Brisbane, particularly on the bayside, have an appreciation for and an affinity with fishing, my electorate of Bonner is also the proud home of Wilson Fishing Rods, Australia's premier fishing rod manufacturer. As such, I decided to contact Wilson to see if they would like to donate five very special fishing rods, rods that are unique, specially made for this special purpose, and which would also fetch a premium price to aid in the flood relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Alvey fishing reel company is a historic, Brisbane based reel manufacturer that has been in business for more than 90 years. It was a victim of the 1974 Brisbane flood. I felt very confident that they would also do all they could to help, so I contacted Mr Bruce Alvey to see whether he would join with me and Wilson rods in a special partnership to manufacture five distinctive fishing reels and create a limited edition fishing rod and reel combination, the proceeds of which would be donated to the flood recovery fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted that both these Brisbane based companies were enthusiastic in producing a unique fishing rod and reel combination, one that we all knew would appeal to a collector, regardless of whether or not they liked fishing. The final specification of the Alvey fishing reel is made of Huon pine that is over 1,000 years old. It is turned by a master craftsman and features a unique laser-cut design on the stainless steel face of the reel. The reels are then adorned with original 1950s Alvey badges that were salvaged from the 1974 floods from where the original Alvey fishing factory was situated in St Lucia, Brisbane. These fishing rods are proudly Brisbane made and are engraved by Brisbane's premier engravers, John Hammond and his 2IC Duncan Vickers, who have very generously donated their master engraving on these exclusive numbered fishing reels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sold three of these unique pieces but, given that the flood had been and gone and so many people had given so generously to other appeals, I wondered if the last two reels would fetch such a premium price. Any doubts were truly unfounded. While I spoke at one of my local Rotary meetings, I informed the audience of this great opportunity to give back and receive simultaneously. To my surprise, after the speech a local businessman came to me and said that he would immediately write out a $2,500 cheque to secure one. I was in a quandary about what to do with the last rod and reel and decided to leave it with Toni, the lovely businesswoman who runs the Water Tower Bait and Tackle Shop in Manly. Toni happened to mention the rod and reel to her electrician, who immediately wanted to buy the last combination, sight unseen, for another $2,500. The only thing I regret is that we did not have more to sell. Campbell Newman said that the flood recovery would be a marathon, not a sprint; I am happy to have completed our leg of this marathon and at the end donate just over $10,000 towards the Brisbane flood recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bonner office could not have done this alone. I would like to thank Toni, Doug Barton, a man who gives so much to the bayside community, Greg Willems, Paul Vincent, Steve Taylor and Mark Chapman—a man with a big heart for his community—for their outstanding generosity and support in doing their bit to help rebuild our wonderful city and get our fellow Brisbanites back on their feet. The great news is that you are all now the proud owners of a unique heirloom.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="WF6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:55</span>):  It is customary for new members and senators to use part of their first speech to give some account of their careers before their election. I will be very interested to see how much new Greens senator Rhiannon chooses to tell us about her political past, because so far she and her supporters have been very reticent. As evidence of this, let me tell the House about a battle which has been going on on the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, where ever since April a number of people have been trying to write a full, honest and properly referenced account of Senator Rhiannon's early career. All of those efforts have been thwarted by a person called Chris Maltby, who has repeatedly deleted any honest account on the grounds that such attention is disproportionate. Maltby lives in Bondi and is the husband of Waverly Greens Councillor Prue Cancian. He is identified on his Facebook page as a member of the New South Wales Greens. I suspect, although I cannot prove, that he is acting on behalf of the New South Wales Greens or perhaps just the Rhiannon faction. He suppresses any version of Wikipedia which might embarrass the senator.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are the facts about Senator Rhiannon's past that Mr Maltby is so keen to stop you reading? You cannot find these censored facts on Wikipedia, but at least you will be able to find them in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. At least in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>Australians can read a version of the text which Mr Maltby has been repeatedly excising from Wikipedia. In 1971 the Communist Party split over attitudes to the Soviet Union, particularly the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Senator Rhiannon's parents, Bill and Freda Brown, left the CPA and joined the Socialist Party of Australia, which was loyal to the Soviet Union and supported the invasion. The Browns joined the CPA at a time when it was totally loyal to the Soviet Union and Stalin's leadership. They could not have remained in the CPA if they did not share this belief. Brown was the editor of the CPA paper <span style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span>, which strongly supported the Soviet invasion of Hungary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mark Aarons writes: 'Lee Rhiannon became a senior office bearer of the youth wing of the SPA, the Socialist Party of Australia, serving on the central committee's youth subcommittee, attending the Australia-Soviet Friendship Society and developing close relations with the Soviet, Czechoslovak and East German communist youth groups.' In '77, Rhiannon led an SPA delegation to Moscow at the invitation of Leonid Brezhnev. In 1980-93, Lee O'Gorman, as she was then, was New South Wales Secretary of the Union of Australian Women, founded in 1950 as a CPA front and controlled by the SPA after the 1971 split. In the late 1970s, Bill Brown was the editor of the SPA journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Survey </span>and O'Gorman was a regular contributor to it. Her articles frequently praised the Soviet Union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mark Aarons wrote of Rhiannon's past in May 2011:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This would be simply history if Rhiannon had admitted her youthful errors and moved on. But, in a lengthy blog posted last August, she defended her parents' and her own political records … </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But nowhere does she acknowledge how dreadfully wrong she was about the Soviet Union, nor express regrets for her gullible admiration of this abominable system. In failing to deal with her history honestly, Rhiannon places a question mark over her suitability for any leadership role, especially in a party supposedly built on integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there it is: the text which the friends of Senator Rhiannon do not wish the people of Australia to read. Sources were provided at Wikipedia for most of the statements for the text I have just read. Maybe some of these statements are wrong. If so, Senator Rhiannon should get up and explain in the Senate where the text I have read out is wrong and tell us the truth about her political past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Rhiannon's case is that she did not grow up as a wild student radical but was a dedicated member of the pro-Soviet Communist Party. When the CPA tried to free itself from Stalinism, she joined the breakaway pro-Soviet SPA. She loyally supported all the crimes of the Soviet Union during that time. And this was not a passing phase for her; she remained a senior and active member of the SPA until well into her 30s. She only abandoned Communism when it had visibly failed as a useful vehicle for far-left politics. She then joined the Greens, which is now the main vehicle for those kinds of politics in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be said that people should not be punished for the follies of the past and we should forgive and forget; but, as Mark Aarons pointed out in the text I quoted, forgiveness must be preceded by repentance. Senator Rhiannon has expressed no such regrets. She says she is no longer a communist, and I accept that. But she has not said that communism is and always was a false and pernicious doctrine that caused the deaths of tens of millions of people and is still causing oppression and misery in China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba. I would like to know what Senator Rhiannon now thinks of those events of the seventies and eighties which took place while she was an enthusiastic supporter of the Soviet Union. What does she think of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? What does she think of the suppression of Solidarity and the imposition of martial law in Poland? What does she think of the Berlin Wall, the shooting of people trying to escape to freedom? What does she think of the persecution of Andrei Sakharov and the Soviet dissidents? What does she think of the anti-Semitism of the Brezhnev regime? My challenge to Senator Rhiannon as she makes her first speech is to tell us honestly and clearly about her political past, tell us clearly that she has repudiated Communism not just as a tactical convenience but as a matter of conviction. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:00</span>):  What can we expect from retail pricing on the National Broadband Network? According to the Prime Minister, we can expect lower prices. She told the House of Representatives last year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Do you want families in your electorate to have the benefit of more competition, better broadband products and lower prices? Then tick the National Broadband Network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She also told the House of Representatives:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… look at the fact that Australians pay high prices for broadband and to look at the fact that the industry is telling us—and the Tasmanian example bears it out—that by creating a model with retail price competition you get cheaper prices, because that is what competition is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She also told us last year that Australians pay very high prices for broadband by world standards. In other words, a very clear message from the Prime Minister: the National Broadband Network will bring cheaper prices. It will bring lower prices once you start to get retail prices being announced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the winter recess, we did see retail prices being announced. Internode, one of the larger internet service providers in Australia, announced that it would be charging $59.95 a month for its entry-level product, which is a 12-megabit-per-second product with a 30-gigabyte-per-month download limit. Interestingly that is the same price as it charges for its current naked DSL offering also with a 30-gigabyte download limit. As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, DSL products offer speeds of 20 megabits per second down, depending upon how far from the exchange you are. What one can say is that the closest equivalent to the 12-megabit entry-level offering is today's ADSL offering—$59.95 in today's world from Internode, $59.95 on the NBN—a very long way away from prices being reduced for retail broadband services as the Prime Minister claimed, in the House of Representatives last year, we could all expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly what we also saw from Internode was that the top-end price went up. Their top-end price today for a naked DSL product with a 1,000-gigabyte or one-terabyte download limit per month is $149.95. The top-end product in the NBN world which will have 100 megabits of speed and also a one-terabyte download limit is now $189.95 a month. Any suggestion that broadband prices are going down seems to be at odds with the prices that have been announced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This left Senator Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in a bit of a pickle. How was he to reconcile the actual pricing that had been announced and the claims of the Prime Minister last year? His solution was to leap upon some announcements by Exetel and Dodo, two other internet service providers. Exetel put out pricing and Dodo, to use the words in Senator Conroy's media release of 23 July, has 'mooted a sub-$40 price' although we have seen no more than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key point I want to make is that it is quite wrong to argue, as Senator Conroy has done, that, because internet service providers who are acknowledged to be discount operators at the discount end of the market are offering lower prices than Internode, that proves that National Broadband Network retail prices will be lower than today's broadband prices. It is a non sequitur. The reality is that Internode has a market share of nearly three per cent whereas Exetel has only about 0.9 per cent in market share. It is true that Dodo have a similar market share to Internode, but we have not seen any actual pricing from them yet. It has simply been 'mooted'. I make the point that while there is nothing wrong with being discount operators, as Dodo and Exetel are, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reports that over the period October 2010 to March 2011, 4.5 per cent of its complaints concerned Dodo although it had a market share of 2.9 per cent. I simply make the point that the reality based upon the prices which have now been disclosed by several operators is that there is no evidence at all for the belief, that the Prime Minister articulated, that the National Broadband Network is going to mean reduced prices for broadband services. In fact, on the contrary: what the pricing that has been released demonstrates is that consumers can expect, at the very best, prices to flatline and in reality they are going to increase.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:05</span>):  Earlier today BlueScope Steel announced to the Australian Stock Exchange that its board had approved a major restructure of its steel-producing operations at Port Kembla and Western Port. Eight hundred jobs will be lost at Port Kembla and a further 200 will be lost at Western Port. Steel production at the Port Kembla works, which is located within my electorate of Cunningham, will be halved to 2.6 million tonnes. A number of other divisions will be closed down. The No. 6 blast furnace will be mothballed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision by BlueScope Steel's board this morning is from a commercial decision-making process. The company's statement to the ASX indicates quite clearly that the company is experiencing 'structural change in the global steel industry' and an 'unprecedented combination of economic challenges' including 'a record high Australian dollar, high raw material costs, low prices for steel' and 'low domestic steel demand' in the wake of the global financial crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the intent of the federal opposition to link this commercial decision to the introduction of a carbon price in July 2012, BlueScope Steel again makes it clear that today's decision:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… is a direct response to the economic factors affecting our business and is not related to the Federal Government's proposed carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thoughts, along with those of my colleague the member for Throsby, are dedicated to ensuring that BlueScope Steel workers who will ultimately be affected by the decision to restructure the steel industry have all the necessary services available to them to deal with this loss of jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second priority for us as a Labor government is to do what it has done in the past: set out a plan to secure the steel industry during this painful restructuring process. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and the Minister for Human Services announced a $140 million package of initiatives aimed at ensuring that steelworkers and their families in the Illawarra community know that the Commonwealth Labor government stands shoulder to shoulder with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This $140 million package to the support the Illawarra community has three elements: firstly, assistance of up to $10 million over two years to ensure immediate access to intensive employment services by Job Services Australia providers; secondly, bringing forward $100 million of the $300 million of the Steel Transformation Plan to assist with the continuation of BlueScope Steel as the major steel producer, a major employer in the Illawarra and the prospect for reactivating the No. 6 blast furnace when the steel market enables profitable sales to resume; and, thirdly, the establishment of a $30 million investment and innovation fund, focusing on supporting new business ventures, high-value jobs predominantly but not only in manufacturing, and manufacturing services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Throsby and I look forward to working with Dr Don Russell, the Secretary of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. He has been tasked with leading a whole-of-government response to BlueScope Steel's announcement and to develop a longer term coordinated structural adjustment strategy for the Illawarra. During the next few days all care and concern should be focused on the workers of BlueScope Steel and their families. Today has been a difficult day for each of them. But over the next few weeks attention must also move to the region, to make use of the $30 million innovation and investment fund. We will work with local organisations and unions in the Illawarra to see what projects can be implemented to maintain and create high quality skilled and ongoing jobs in manufacturing and manufacturing services. Regional structural adjustment packages do work; we know this in our region. The long-term focus in the Illawarra will remain on continuing to diversify our regional economy. Since the 1982-83 downturn and the long recession in the coal industry at the time, over the last 30 years the Illawarra region has transformed. We are in a much better position to adjust to the restructuring of our manufacturing sector than indeed we were even 30 years ago. Although manufacturing still plays a major role in the economy, we now see that BlueScope Steel is rivalled by places like the University of Wollongong and the region's health and community sectors as major employers. Despite today's announcement on steel and the pessimism surrounding talk of manufacturing in Australia, I am more than optimistic that the future of manufacturing is strong in our region and lies in the transition to high value-added production— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:10</span>):  For three months, Australia's world-class health system refused to treat Della Johnson, a resident of my electorate, who suffers from the one-in-a-million vascular disease of the brain called moyamoya—not because the operation was unavailable in Queensland, not because treating surgeons did not know what to do, but simply because Della comes from a state that cannot treat moyamoya and there was no agreement between hospital regions as to who would foot the bill. It exposes in our wonderful health system the fact that we have eight jurisdictions and many more area health services, and are about to have a lot more under the fourth level of bureaucracy to be introduced by the Gillard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern is that none of these reforms address the issue of Della. Were she a resident of New South Wales she would now be cured and recovering, but instead she has just had her first operation, last week—her second one is scheduled for 24 August—for the simple reason that she lives in the wrong state and in the wrong postcode. It is time for COAG to consider these issues so that streamlined care for very rare surgery can be in the best hands in this nation. With a population of 20 million people we cannot always expect to have every single operation available in every jurisdiction. But patients should not be held, delayed and pawned between states and hospital services looking for the cheapest way to do an operation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Princess Alexandra Hospital last week it became obvious that an edict has been released by Queensland Health to cap the number of times that a patient can visit outpatients. It is of great concern to anyone working in the public system that it is not the most efficient thing to do to be sending sick patients back to get another referral from a GP before they can return to the public outpatients system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue here is that people who have complex conditions such as diabetes and epilepsy, or who are struggling with heart disease, or who are road trauma victims with broken bones, can only visit an outpatients department twice before they have to go back and get more paperwork. This was an absolutely ridiculous proposition—that you would have to go back and sit and wait in a GP's office, hope for an appointment, pick up more paperwork and charge the Medicare system, only to go back and have your third appointment at outpatients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, you can understand as a diabetic that, if you need your diabetic appointment and then a podiatry appointment and then to see your dietician, to have to return to a GP is absolutely ridiculous and inefficient, and a dreadful waste and social cost. I am glad that that edict has been turned around, and I want a guarantee from the Queensland Minister for Health that that will occur and that doctors will decide how often they see patients and to whom they refer. If you want to get outpatients seeing more patients more effectively, then engage in a meaningful discussion about integrated and primary healthcare provision; do not just cap doctors and tell patients, 'Go back and pick up more paperwork before we will offer you any more treatment,' because that is an abuse of the Australian health care agreement which says that you cannot refuse to treat a public patient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also of great concern to me that in Queensland, in my electorate of Bowman, the Eastern Busway, due for completion at the almost mind-twisting date of 2026, has now been further downgraded by the Bligh government from a project to a 'concept'. Anyone who lives in my commuter community of Redlands, where 3,600 people jump in vehicles and travel down one highway every morning of the working week, will be absolutely distraught that this is now not even going to happen by 2026. We are a nation looking for smart public health solutions, and the last thing we need is delays to really important infrastructure for no reason other than that the state government cannot manage money. They committed out to 2026. There was plenty of opportunity to reschedule this. There is plenty of opportunity to look at alternative busway proposals that do not involve kilometres of tunnel and which would be far more efficient and could be built in a shorter time frame. I just think it is ridiculous that the children of the current Treasurer will have graduated from school before they ever get to travel on a busway. I think it is ridiculous that a major part of south-eastern Brisbane does not have the benefit of a decent busway for little other reason, it appears, than the fact that Redlands is not a part of Brisbane and was not the beneficiary of some of the visionary work of Campbell Newman in building tunnels and major road infrastructure for our city at a time when state Labor was not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My great concern for my 6,000 residents who live on North Stradbroke Island and on the southern bay islands is that all ferry and water-taxi travel will not be exempted from a carbon tax. Removing that 6.8c a litre excise on diesel will be a direct hit for people who have no other option than to use a water-taxi or a barge for their vehicle. You will understand, Mr Speaker, that you cannot drive off an island, so this is absolutely essential travel. It is public transport and commuting that should be supported in this country, and I urge the Prime Minister to consider an exemption for public transport.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:15</span>):  Tonight I want to speak about the sad passing of baby Dominic, who passed away on the 13th of this month. Dominic was the youngest child of Alannah McKenna. Tonight I want to pay tribute to the strength and courage she has shown in this very difficult circumstance of losing her child. The loss of a child is a grief that no mother should have to bear, more so a young mother. That is why I want to acknowledge Alannah McKenna and pay tribute to the life of baby Dominic, who was born with a very rare genetic disorder known as infantile GM1 gangliosidosis. Essentially, where most people can break down ganglioside in the body, Dominic's rare condition caused his body to store the fatty substance in his nerve cells as well as his spleen, liver and brain. Children born with this rare condition usually do not survive beyond their third birthday. In this case, Alannah and her family had just one birthday with baby Dominic in what was no doubt an extraordinary effort of having to go through the emotional and physical challenges of tending and nurturing a child through palliative care. Despite everything, baby Dominic, through his fighting spirit and resilient personality, brought enough smiles and happiness to outshine his terminal condition and to last his grieving family a lifetime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alannah's extraordinary commitment to Dominic throughout his short and precious life, as well as her care for her other two children, her son and daughter, is a testament to motherhood and to the young women in my electorate. I also want to pay a special tribute to Alannah's family, who supported her through thick and thin and who remained steadfast in their commitment to raising awareness of Dominic's condition. In paying tribute to them I would like to place on the parliamentary record the issues they want raised and believe warrant our attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When dealing with the treatment of rare genetic disorders we need to take a closer look at strengthening procedures that would ensure that laws which govern medical practice, as they apply to the application of medical know-how, are given more room for manoeuvre when it comes to a question between a fait accompli approach to palliative care and last resort measures to apply what could potentially be life-saving treatment. The issues that were raised with me and which I put forward to the House are that even in the event that qualified care, funding and medical knowledge are available, their application can often be prevented by law because of issues to do with the phasing stages between what is deemed an experimental trial and the clinical phase of treatment. Such legal restrictions place additional emotional hardships on those families and friends who have to care for critically ill loved ones, as was the case with baby Dominic and his family. Once again, I commend Alannah and her family's resolve and, on behalf of the community, offer our condolences for the loss of Dominic.</span>

                  </a>  The petition calls on the House to recognise a Palestinian state in accordance with all relevant UN resolutions and international and humanitarian law which Australia has consistently upheld. Beyond the importance of applying international law to this very important issue, there are practical necessities for establishing a Palestinian state. The issue of Palestinian statehood is of major concern to many Australians; indeed, there is support for the recognition of a Palestinian state in the broader international and Australian community. This is especially so with a large section of my constituency in Calwell. The petition I tabled this evening carries the hopes of many Australians who are very keen to see our country and, indeed, our government play a role in this ongoing issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This House has on many occasions affirmed its support for a two-state solution to the issue of Palestine and Israel, a two-state solution that will guarantee security and peace for both states. This evening in presenting this petition I also want to place on record my support for Australia to join the vast majority of nations in recognising Palestine as it seeks statehood in the UN General Assembly in September this year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:20</span>):  I would like to speak about infrastructure in my electorate of Boothby. One of the issues I have spoken about several times before is the issue of having a non-stop South Road from Darlington to Wingfield—22 kilometres of non-stop expressway. It is a priority of the RAAA of South Australia; it is a priority of a number of economic development councils; and it is a priority of two local councils which cover my electorate—the City of Marion and the City of Onkaparinga.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a bit of history here. In 2006 the South Australian government promised that they would fix the intersection at Sturt Road and South Road. That has not happened. In 2007 the federal Labor Party in opposition then through Kevin Rudd and also the then shadow minister for transport promised that they would fix Sturt Road and South Road. Again, it has not happened. They have commissioned a traffic study which looked at fixing this intersection and at present it involves approximately $1 billion of infrastructure work and is currently unfunded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But today we had the extraordinary announcement that the South Australian government have decided to switch an interchange worth $75 million, which they promised 18 months ago, with a traffic light. After all of the waste which has occurred—the billions of dollars at state and federal level—we have now have no sense of priorities. Something that was promised to voters only 18 months ago has now been ditched—a $75 million interchange for a traffic light. Worse, it was left to the department to announce this to parliament. The secretary of the department confirmed it before a committee hearing and the departmental executive responsible for this, Andy Milazzo, said before the hearing that he did not know if the minister had been informed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question is: what is it about Labor governments and funding infrastructure in Darlington? We have a whole succession of promises going back 5½ years and nothing has happened. It is really not good enough. This is something that has been promised and still never delivered. Rod Hook, the chief executive of the department, said they were hoping for federal funding. Well, the federal funding that was promised for the intersection just down the road still has not been delivered after the federal government has been in for almost four years and 5½ years after state government promised it. It is not good enough. This is another breach of faith. It is another broken promise for residents in the southern suburbs. It is just an extraordinarily chaotic process, and incredibly cynical, whereby something is promised before the election and then never delivered and the promise is just quietly shelved and not acted on. It is not good enough. It cannot happen again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be very clear: New South Wales is not in a black hole, nor is the New South Wales economy in crisis. Yet Mr O'Farrell continues to repeat these alarmist claims as he prepares to rip the heart out of the public sector of New South Wales when he brings his budget down on 6 September.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is an ugly thing. It never looks good to the people who lose jobs; it never looks good to the people who wave them goodbye as they leave their workplace; it never looks good to families that have to live with the loss of freedom, the loss of security, the loss of hope for the future; and the loss of possibilities that their employment offered. The ravage of unemployment is something that the people of the Central Coast have largely been spared in recent years. This is due to the efforts of successive Labor governments at federal and state levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in the hands of the Liberals in New South Wales, that is about to change. As those who follow events in New South Wales would know, Mr O'Farrell has, without any warning, not least to the people who baited him in at the state election, embarked on a vicious series of cuts to the New South Wales public sector. Mr O'Farrell's axe now hangs over as many as one in four public sector jobs in New South Wales. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those members in this place from the New South Wales National Party should note that the first job losses have been in the Department of Primary Industries—like lambs to the slaughter. That is how the National Party has led it rural constituencies to those terrible job cuts. Right across New South Wales Mr O'Farrell has made it clear he is looking forward to slashing jobs—to slashing the conditions of teachers and nurses and other essential public sector workers—in the coming state budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For us on the Central Coast, that means that up to one in four of our local public sector families will not have the disposable income that they currently have. They will not have the income that keeps our economy ticking over. They will not have the disposable income to spend on products in our local shops, and they will not have the disposable income to spend on services from our local businesses, many of which are already struggling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These cuts are an act of betrayal of the people in our great state. They are unjustified and potentially catastrophic under the current economic conditions on the coast. With federal economic stimulus projects in our area, like the Building the Education Revolution, nearing completion, our regional economy is slowing. Federal Labor's stimulus programs really kept people working on the Central Coast for a very long time. Mr O'Farrell's axe will undo that good work—undo the good work that saw us get through the global financial crisis, when federal Labor acted to make sure that Australians did not have to suffer the destructive impact of unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the Central Coast economy could take a terrible blow, a disabling blow, from the O'Farrell cuts. As well as the economic costs there will be social costs. I ask the House to contemplate the potential effects of funding and job cuts to child protection workers. They are unimaginable. Tragedies already occur through the strain on support services. Less funding and fewer workers will simply mean more neglect. There is nothing good about that scenario.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to ask: will Mr O'Farrell standby and play Pontius Pilate when some tragedy occurs because police, community service and mental health workers are under resourced? More likely, he will insist that the federal government step in and fix the mess he is going to create. The O'Farrell cuts are dangerous and dishonest. They are based on fiscal falsehoods and they are immoral. I condemn and deplore the New South Wales Liberal government's job cutting. With no reason they are committed to inflicting pain and suffering on the state, and determined to inflict pain and loss of jobs on the families of the Central Coast. I heartily encourage all local public sector workers to join the rally against the O'Farrell government in Sydney on 8 September.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:29</span>):  Football clubs are often the social and sporting pulse of country communities. The Northern Riverina Football and Netball League held its grand finals at West Wyalong on Saturday. It was a fantastic finish to a memorable season, Barellan winning the senior footy with the last kick of the game and its netball girls coming from behind to pip Ungarie in the A grade decider. Peter McFadyen, in his first year as president, deserves praise for his leadership, as does Chris Daniher, whose marvellous encouragement of his young charges resulted in Ungarie winning the under-14 title. There is no country footballing name better known than 'Daniher' and Chris's commitment to his beloved Ungarie helps keep the game alive in that district.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:30</span>):  The Prime Minister seems to believe that the installation of energy saving light bulbs is compensation enough for not-for-profits and charities that are going to get stung by a carbon tax. In particular, enormous costs will be borne by aviation rescue services, such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service, Rockhampton's Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service and the Mackay based CQ Rescue Helicopter Service. CQ Rescue has estimated that through the increase in aviation fuel and electricity prices alone their carbon tax bill will be around $20,000 per year, which will grow as the carbon tax grows. Back in July the Prime Minister, when confronted by carbon tax concerns from the Royal Flying Doctor Service, referred to a so-called special fund and said that she would cover any impacts they feel from pricing carbon, including direct assistance. However, in the carbon tax documentation entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Securing a </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lean </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nergy </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uture</span> not once are the words 'not-for-profit, non-profit, charity or charitable' even mentioned. The Prime Minister has claimed this special fund, set aside for compensating not-for-profits, is contained within the Low Carbon Communities program. The entire Low Carbon Communities program is only $330 million over six years, with at least $30 million and quite possibly $130 million already earmarked for supposed assistance to low-income households. That leaves $300 million at best to be spread across some 600,000 registered not-for-profits in Australia, roughly equating to $83 per not-for-profit a year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Answering a question of mine in question time last week, the Prime Minister said, 'That's not how it works.' How does it work? The rest of the $300 million will presumably go towards items listed in the program's description in the Clean Energy Future documents. The description does not refer to compensation for not-for-profits. The closest this program comes to helping organisations like CQ Rescue, the Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service and, indeed, the Royal Flying Doctor Service is in undertaking energy efficiency upgrades to community facilities, but installing an energy saving light bulb in the main office is not going to compensate for the increase in aviation fuel costs, which is the main problem, particularly for CQ Rescue, with its estimated $20,000 carbon tax increase. The Prime Minister has been well and truly caught out in this falsehood that she is going to compensate not-for-profits. The problem is that it will be the not-for-profit charitable groups that are trying to help people and save lives that suffer and not her—not that is until we get to the ballot box.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (10:33):   Recently, I was pleased to represent the Minister for Employment Participation, Kate Ellis, the member for Adelaide, at the launch of the Bridport Innovations Track, a Jobs Fund project in my electorate of Bass. The project involved the construction of a 10-kilometre walking track in a circular route around Bridport and included the employment of 27 trainee participants of various ages. This development project has brought much-needed jobs to the people of Bridport and enabled track workers to gain Certificate II in Conservation and Land Management. It is an important project, which is why the Australian government has committed more than $750,000 towards its development. There are limited training opportunities in the Bridport region. Yes, it is an enviable lifestyle, but small and remote communities, by their very nature, have limited education and training pathways for young people, and that is why I am so pleased that we put our money into the walking track, which has huge flow-on benefits for our community by helping local residents gain qualifications and jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of a walking track has been around in Bridport for about 20 years. It commenced in 2007. The track is a great example of quality workmanship, including an impressive metal bridge, drywall, smooth and even walking surfaces, which were levelled by hand. The Jobs Fund was set up to create jobs, to develop skills through projects that build community social infrastructure—projects like the Bridport Innovations Walking Track. We established the Jobs Fund to support families and communities most affected by the global recession. In the government's view, it was money extremely well spent. Some 21 jobs and 30 traineeships were created during the development, with a number of them now in work. Under the Jobs Fund about $171 million was announced for 225 projects across Australia. In Tasmania, there are 10 of these projects worth more than $6 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmanian state cricket team coach, Tim Coyle, presented trainees with certificates and likened the trainees' team effort to Tasmania's recent success in cricket. Bridport Innovations have also set up a website and Facebook page for the Bridport Walking Track, in order to give visitors more information about the track. I have already had interest for the Launceston Walking Group who have used the track and, I might say, also used the coffee shops in Bridport. I congratulate the local Bridport community, the Dorset Council and all people involved in the construction of the walking track. It is a very impressive project that will bring great benefit to the local and surrounding communities for years to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:36</span>):  I have been holding many community information booths across Brisbane over the past few weeks, and universally I have been hearing the same story. Small and medium businesses within the electorate of Brisbane are not happy with this government's carbon tax. There will be resulting problems for businesses. I am told it will cause complete chaos, and that is because electricity providers are going to pass on the tax. The higher the electricity providers' costs the higher the price that business will have to pay for electricity. A small deli and cafe owner in Clayfield recently told me that his options are to pass on the cost to consumers or to absorb the cost himself. On top of the increasing costs and the downturn in his trade that is not possible, so that means that he will have to let staff go. Traders at the Brisbane Markets also told me that their options are to pass on the cost of produce to consumers or shed staff. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be the real impact on this carbon tax to businesses in my electorate. The one thing that we know is that, if electricity is hit, it is not 300, 400 or 500 companies that will be affected, it will be thousands of businesses in Brisbane. This is the worst possible time to hit Australia with a new economy-wide tax that will not achieve its purpose. All it will do is clean out wallets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard that in the United States the cap and trade scheme, which is their equivalent of a carbon tax, is dead. In Japan it is off the table. In Canada it is gone. In Korea it has been deferred. In Europe the scheme has raised revenue of $1 per person per year over the last five years. The Australian system will raise $400 per person. The cost is 400 times heavier per person than the European scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend I will continue to hold community corners and information booths in the suburbs of Ascot, Hamilton and Clayfield, and I suspect that the story will be the same, that people are not happy with this carbon tax. They are not happy with being misled just days before the election. All that this tax will do is have a devastating impact on many businesses, workers and their families in the electorate of Brisbane.</span>

Colyton Public School was first established as a humble timber shack on Simpson Hill Road in Mount Druitt during 1861. Because of the location close to South Creek the school was relocated up the hill in the form of a brick home to house the principal and classrooms. This building, the old schoolmaster's college, was set up between 1883 and 1898 at the present site in Nelson Street, Mount Druitt. The two further classrooms, in one large building, were erected in 1898 and today still stand proudly with the brick construction and long veranda as the colonial room. On Tuesday, 2 August, during New South Wales Education Week, Colyton Public School celebrated the 150th anniversary with a formal assembly and an open day attended by past students and community members. Staff members hired costumes covering a whole range of years from colonial right through to the sixties, and ex-students arrived from as far away as Darwin, coming from a diverse range of current professions covering doctors, dentists and prominent business owners. All ex-students showed a pride in growing up in the local Mount Druitt area and continued their support of public education by making personal donations to the library. I just want to congratulate them on such a great sense of civic and community spirit. The following evening, Wednesday, 3 August, past and present students and staff members gathered to celebrate with a bush dance and the evening was a great success with smiling faces, including some of the newest arrivals, two students who reached there from Christmas Island that day.</span>

Congratulations to Geoff Yates, the Principal, to teachers, staff, students, parents and everyone involved in celebrating Colyton Public School reaching this important milestone.</span>

I thank them for being here, particularly those from Western Australia. I know what the trip is costing them and I thank them for being prepared to stand up for their industry and families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government will hit the transport sector, their customers and consumers with their carbon tax on diesel from July of 2014. The Australian Trucking Association has estimated that the carbon tax will cost the industry $510 million in the 2014-15 year alone, with higher costs for smaller owner operators competing in aggressive markets. This sector is working hard. They have been buying lower emission engines, paying up to $50,000 per prime mover for low emissions engines. They recycle their oils. They reduce and manage waste. They have lowered their fuel consumption, and yet they are part of the Australian families, businesses and industry that have voluntarily, at major individual cost, effectively assisted in reducing Australia's emissions intensity by almost 50 per cent in the last 15 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to some of these businesses. I can only imagine the accounting nightmare for those with a business that uses a combination of forklifts, bobcats, backhoes, four and a half-tonne vehicles and prime movers. Whether you have scrapers, dozers or whatever you have this is going to be a nightmare. Those in the transport sector have commonsense and experience. They know that Labor's carbon tax is going to have a disproportionate effect on rural and regional Australia because of the tax on diesel. They know that this is a compounding cascading tax and they know that this is a major issue in their own businesses as well as in their communities. They know it is a major cost for their customers and they know, as Ross Garnaut has said, that ultimately households in Australia will pay the carbon tax. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional people will pay more for everything—food, everyday goods, the houses they build or renovate, repairs and maintenance—everything that is delivered on the back of a prime mover. They also know that effective transport is the lifeblood of regional and remote Australia and they know there is no escape or mitigation, because this tax is going to hit domestic aviation fuel, domestic shipping fuel, rail fuel, stationary energy fuel—all of that will be hit by Labor's carbon tax. Overall, the transport sector will pay at least $800 million more every year under Labor's carbon tax and there is no guarantee that this tax will not apply to petrol in the future. In conclusion, I thank those who have come to Canberra today to voice their very serious concerns about the tax.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:44</span>):  Today I rise to pay tribute to community sector workers in my electorate who are working with individuals who have a disability. I attended two community events recently that really brought home to me the valuable work that this sector is doing. On 2 August I attended a DisabiliTEA event in Holt hosted by the Sharing Places organisation. I acknowledge the participants in the program: Carl Blakers, Veronica Sadkowski, Mirella Sadkowski, Rebecca Johns, Stephen Perry, Sean Henderson, Tracey Greene, Caroline Frey, Kerry Scott and Tiffany Stevenson. The Sharing Places staff: Susan Healy, Kylie Stokes, Kaz Kaczmarek, Alicia Gaudie, Spozmai Nozhat, Donggook Kang, Lynnette Thompson, Fiona Lukacs and Abbie Costa. And other attendees supporting the work of Sharing Places: Ken Baker, Emily Weeks, Justyn McDonald, Dee McGrath, Felicity Cotterill, Helen Walker and Julie Grehan. All of these attendees were there to support the proposal for a National Disability Insurance Scheme. They recognise the valuable contribution that a National Disability Insurance Scheme will do for people with disability in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next day, on 3 August—by coincidence my birthday—I attended the opening ceremony of Ross Walker Lodge in the St Margaret's Church Hall. The Ross Walker Lodge will support six people in the ACT with intellectual disabilities, and I would like to pay tribute to Harvey Smith, John Goss, Gordon Ramsay, Audrey Walker, the widow of Ross Walker, and the many ACT MLAs who were in attendance, particularly Joy Burch, the Minister for Community Services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ross Walker, after whom the lodge is named, was born at about the same time as my paternal grandfather, Keith Leigh. They both entered the Methodist ministry in the post-war era and both were committed to a service in the community that involved focusing on the most disadvantaged, bringing the gospel but also bringing social change to the community. The Ross Walker Lodge fits proudly in that tradition, which is of great pride to many of us on this side of the House. The Ross Walker Lodge will be an important part of the work in the community that the Uniting Church does, and I am sure that many volunteers will continue to assist with that. I pay tribute to all of those involved in these two important disability events.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:47</span>):  On Sunday, 17 July I had the honour of attending the St Paul's Anglican Church 125th anniversary service in Seville for the Seville St Paul's Anglican Church. As you would expect, Mr Deputy Speaker, it was a day to celebrate and reflect on a wonderful history of that parish in Seville. We met with a wide range of family, friends, church members and community leaders. Rosemary Varty spoke of the history of the church, which began with seven men, including her great grandfather, William Smith Aitken, who met back in February 1886 to plan the church, which opened in the July of that year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of the church, its history, is the story of the Seville community and, as you would expect, the wonderful historical reflection touched on the role of the church in tough national economic times, in the depressions of 1890 and of course in the 1930s, its role during wars and conflicts, its role during natural disasters—floods, droughts and bushfires—and of course its roles in ministering to families and individuals in the Seville community over 125 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a proud time for the church community. It was a time to reflect on the growth of the Seville community from back in those pre-Federation days. There were many descendants of families who played such a critical role in the foundation years of the church who were present. There was great reflection, as you would expect, on the contribution those families had made to ensure that the church survived and that it played the role that it has played at critical times in the history of the Seville community. I pay tribute to all of the members of the church who were there on that Sunday one month ago. I also pay tribute to those who came before them who helped build the church and sustain it through those years to the great benefit of the Seville community.</span>

I recently had the pleasure of attending five DisabiliTeas that were held in my local community to highlight support for a national disability insurance scheme. I wish to acknowledge the organisers of each of these events. Firstly, I wish to acknowledge local residents, Kevin Finlayson and Emma Husar—two dedicated community activists in my electorate—who facilitated the gathering of over 60 people in support of this campaign, including members and supporters of the Nepean disability social group. I acknowledge area manager Deb Emelhain and the staff at Lifestart Nepean who allowed me to meet some of the families who will benefit from an NDIS in the years to come.</span>

I thank them for providing me with the opportunity to hear the moving words of local mother Diana Jelovic, as she shared her experiences of having a child with autism. I also acknowledge the Jamieson branch of the Australian Foundation for Disability (AFFORD), coordinated by Sarah Delaney and CEO Tim Walton. Meeting the clients and carers of this outstanding organisation gave perspective to the number of lives that will be touched by an NDIS. I also acknowledge the strong leadership and support of the Every Australian Counts campaign by AFFORD. Finally, I acknowledge Anne Bouboulas of the community care team at Anglicare Penrith who gathered around 30 of their hardworking staff members to raise awareness of this campaign.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These wonderful community events brought together people with disabilities, their parents, their carers and service providers, united in their desire to see a better future for people with disabilities in Australia. I am proud to be a part of a government that has put this important issue on the agenda. In recent weeks I have been even more proud to be a part of a government that is taking immediate action to lay the foundations for this massive reform following the release of the Productivity Commission's report. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The system we have today is not delivering the kind of care and support Australians expect for people with disabilities. An NDIS will provide individually tailored care and support to around 410,000 people in Australia with significant disabilities. This represents a significant reform that Australia needs to undertake to provide some of our most vulnerable community members with the opportunities they deserve to be able to reach their full potential and contribute to Australian society in the way we know they can. It will provide greater support and assistance to the unsung heroes of our community—the carers and families of people with disabilities. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  A couple of weeks ago there was a traffic accident on one of the two bridges crossing the Shoalhaven River. It happened in the late afternoon and coincided with the end of a working day with a lot of traffic converging on the bridge heading north. People had finished work and were going home. The Shoalhaven bridge is a traffic pinch point. On either side of the river there is a large urban development. All traffic along the New South Wales South Coast from Kiama to the Victorian border must converge on this bridge. All freight going to the far South Coast from Sydney must converge on this bridge. If these bridges were to fall in the river tomorrow, traffic would have to be diverted through Goulburn, such is the strategic importance of this river crossing to the economy and future of the communities of the New South Wales South Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day this accident occurred traffic was banked up for two hours within the side streets of Nowra, going back to the southern outskirts of the town. This is not the first time this has happened. The southbound bridge is an old railway bridge converted to a road bridge. Incidentally, the railway line stops on the north bank. It is over 100 years old and reaching the end of its useful life. It, too, will soon need to be replaced. A few years ago a truck struck one of the overhead girders and seriously compromised the integrity of the bridge for many months. Traffic had to be diverted onto the northbound bridge at some considerable inconvenience to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to think what would happen if accidents occurred simultaneously on both bridges. For quite some considerable time I have been advocating the need for a third river crossing, as indeed has council and most of the community. It is the key to unlock the economic potential for those of the region south of the river who, frankly, are languishing. We had hoped that the construction of main road 92 would act as a stimulus for further infrastructure growth but until the last leg is constructed it remains a fast road with three kilometres of dirt left to do. Over the last two decades the population of the Shoalhaven has grown by about 2,000 people each year, yet the same road network that serviced the community half this size remains. While council has certainly earmarked a third river crossing as a necessity, the urgency has been brought forward and only increases each year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the minister for regional development visited the Shoalhaven a few months ago the need to advance the project was firmly reinforced. It is not something that can be paid for out of council rates; it needs serious investment support by the federal government. The Princes Highway—or Highway 1, as it has been categorised—is a vital arterial route through the south coast. The road infrastructure of this area has long been neglected and I hope that the change of government in New South Wales brings serious reform. It remains to be seen, but it does not divest responsibility on the part of this government to plan effectively and in a timely manner to allow for future growth of a significant region of New South Wales. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do hope that the minister has taken on board the emphasis that was made in his briefing by council officers. Planning for the third river crossing over the Shoalhaven cannot be further delayed. It must happen now in time for real and effective change to occur. Further procrastination is not an option that our regional economy can afford, nor should have to bear. Not only will the traffic be faster if this happens, with a third river crossing the more free road conditions can only encourage greater traffic movement and more cars, more people and more visitors to the region translate into more congestion.</span>

                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  On Wednesday, 3 August, in Dandenong I attended the annual general meeting of the South East Melbourne Manufacturers Alliance—SEMMA—to discuss the federal government's plan to move to a clean energy future by putting a price on carbon. SEMMA was established in 2003 and today represents over 180 manufacturers in the south-east of Melbourne. The membership is growing and includes Bombardier Transport, Jayco and Hilton Manufacturing. The south-east of Melbourne is a proud manufacturing and employment hub and this sector is growing, aided by residential growth and infrastructure improvements over recent years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of SEMMA's members are located within my electorate. The businesses they represent are an important part of our local economy. Manufacturers are confronting challenging times at present with a high Australian dollar and record terms of trade. It puts the carbon price into perspective to recognise that the rise in the Australian dollar is 20 times the cost impact a carbon price will represent, according to Treasury modelling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of a carbon price to manufacturers will be modest. The introduction of the goods and services tax by the Howard government in July 2000 caused a consumer price index increase of 2.5 per cent. The carbon price to be introduced on 1 July 2012 is expected to see an increase to the CPI of only 0.7 per cent. These facts have been conveniently absent from the campaign of fear that has been conducted by Liberal MPs in south-east Melbourne in recent times, including in particular the hysterical misrepresentations from the Member for Indi. People are sick of hearing opposition members talking down manufacturing in our community, creating uncertainty for industry in challenging economic times. This approach completely overlooks our manufacturing sector's resilience over the long term and ignores the fact that our economy is expected to generate 1.6 million additional jobs by 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturers in my electorate have asked me how much the carbon price will cost them, what support is offered to emissions-intensive industries and what initiatives will be established in moving to more energy efficient practices in industry. The AGM was an opportunity for me to answer their questions. Many businesses in the south-east of Melbourne and across Australia are working towards reducing their energy costs. Organisations that have started to innovate and reduce input costs will be in an advantageous position when the carbon price is introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank outgoing SEMMA president, Russell LaCombre, for his work over the past 12 months and welcome newly elected president Lyndon Joss, who held this role in the early days of SEMMA. I would also like to thank Paul Dowling, the chief executive officer of SEMMA, for enabling me to address SEMMA's AGM. Mr Dowling is an excellent representative of manufacturers in the south-east of Melbourne and I look forward to working with him to promote the interests of manufacturing in south-east Melbourne. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  Only last month the Independent Republic of South Sudan came into existence as the culmination of a comprehensive peace agreement creating two Sudanese nations. It is a momentous threshold to be crossed in a part of Africa that has been ripped through with conflict and suffering for nearly half a century. It offers the prospect of greater peace and stability and of less violence, displacement and suffering for the Sudanese, but in all reality this prospect is still distant and uncertain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In human history, whenever conflict is sought to be resolved by separation, by the creation of separate geographical and sovereign regions and through the distillation of separate political, ethnic or religious populations, the fracture is never achieved without difficulty and pain and inevitably the point of separation represents a period of heightened danger, dislocation and violence. That is true in the Sudan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The comprehensive peace agreement between north and south may have brought a formal end to a civil conflict that has been more or less continuous for 50 years, but the violence has not ended. It is estimated that 1.4 million Sudanese are currently affected by conflict in South Kordofan, one of three key protocol areas, and at least 200,000 are internally displaced. Some of the preconditions for independence set out in the comprehensive peace agreement have not yet been met, including notably the determination processes that were required to be held in critical border zones. The promised referendum on the status of Abyei has not been held and nor have the popular consultations in southern Kordofan and Blue Nile state. In recent weeks there have been reports of the targeted intensive slaughter of the marginalised Nuba ethnic group in South Kordofan and there is a desperate need for an enforceable ceasefire in that region. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The border region of Abyei encapsulates much of what is difficult in bringing peace to Sudan. Abyei is an oil producing region in a country where oil production and oil wealth are the most valuable prize. Eighty per cent of Sudan's oil reserves are located in South Sudan, but the only pipelines run to the north where the refineries are also located. Under the CPA Abyei is supposed to have been subject to its own referendum in order to determine whether it will belong to the north or the south. Like Kashmir, it is a fragment that has bound within it a number of the root causes that define the Sudanese dilemma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To people in Australia this will be a blur of regional names and acronyms that in the end are likely to be reduced to the general sense that the Sudan and its people are trapped in a state of unfathomable, intractable, internecine conflict, but we have to move beyond that barrier of incomprehension if we are, in Australia and in the international community as a whole, committed to supporting the achievement of peace and security for our fellow human beings and greater global stability and prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to reflecting on what is a pressing international and humanitarian crisis—and I want to thank the member for Chifley for seconding this motion and to thank all members who have chosen to contribute to this discussion today—I hope the motion will have a further constructive value in identifying the steps Australia can take to continue our role as a contributor to the future peace and stability of South and North Sudan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of its expansion and reorientation of Australian development assistance, this government has recognised the need to direct aid not only to our region but also to those parts of the world that need it most, and of course this includes Africa. The Sudan is already the second-largest recipient in Africa of Australia's humanitarian assistance, including the provision of $136 million since 2004, but there is more that we can consider doing at this critical juncture. Perhaps the highest priority is the protection of Sudanese civilians, whose safety depends on the observance of the current Status of Forces Agreement and it would be significantly aided if the peacekeeping capacity in areas like South Kordofan were strengthened, which could occur through the expansion of the UN interim security force for Abyei, or UNISFA mandate. Australia should continue to engage with the troika countries, the US, UK and Norway, to support the urgent creation of effective constitutions for North and South Sudan and to make representations to the government of Sudan to improve humanitarian access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an example of how difficult and frustrating the peacekeeping task in Sudan is for peace keepers, four UNISFA staff were killed when their vehicle hit a land mine two weeks ago, with the tragedy made worse by the fact that three of the four survived the initial blast, but died before medical help could arrive when the Sudanese government refused to allow the airlift, saying any unauthorised helicopter in the vicinity would be shot down. As I have done in this place a number of times, I pay tribute to all those who make the sacrifices necessary to give the best of themselves as peacekeepers and, in doing so, demonstrate the best of human nature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that the commitment of predictable and long-term assistance funding is of great value in the circumstances that apply in Sudan. Australia is recognised for its substantial contributions to UN operations in Sudan, including generous contributions to the central emergency fund and the UN Sudan common humanitarian fund. A number of NGOs have identified the importance of Australia's long-term commitment to this kind of funding, especially where it is directed at the safe return of North and South Sudanese, the humanitarian effort in Darfur, where the terrible conflict is now in its eighth year, and ongoing, predictable funding to the UN and other non-government agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to share the experience of an extraordinary young Sudanese Australian women, Nyadol Nyuon, who has been in the parliament yesterday and today as part of a Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Forum for 10 young Australian women to consider ways to increase the number of women in parliament. Nyadol, who is 23 years old, is the Commonwealth nominee for this event. Her family originates from South Sudan, but she was born and raised in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, until her family was accepted for resettlement through the Australian humanitarian program in 2005. Nyadol became an Australian citizen on 11 November 2010. Since her arrival Nyadol has worked within the social services sector to raise awareness of the impact of settlement on young people and how emerging communities might be better assisted in their settlement process. She has completed a bachelor of arts and is currently studying a law degree at the University of Melbourne. This incredible young woman sits on the board of the Ethnic Community Council of Victoria, the Federal Ethnic Community Council of Australia and the Australian Youth Forum among other things. She has published articles for the Australasian Review of African Studies. Nyadol was in South Sudan for the independence celebrations on 9 July. She shared with me these thoughts about her new nation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Six years ago I sat in a classroom of over 90 students. I was a stateless refugee. Now I am attending a forum at Parliament House and a citizen not only of Australia, but now also South Sudan. Australia has given me so much that I cannot give back. My greatest hope is that others, such as those I left behind in refugee camps, can go back to an independent South Sudan and be able to achieve and live meaningful and dignified lives, but I know from my own experience and visits to that country last year to vote in the historic referendum and a month ago to witness the declaration of independence, that such an achievement will be hard to attain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nyadol identified three main areas where Australia can assist South Sudan: governance, agriculture and women's empowerment. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Good governance, the greatest challenge of all, and the enforcement of the rule of law are essential to South Sudan's stability. The complex mixture of tribal and ethnic tension, poverty and a history of war pose great risks to development instability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">South Sudan is blessed with fertile soil in the River Nile. Some have called it the bread basket of the East African region. South Sudan has the possibility of not only feeding its own people, but the whole region. Development of the agricultural sector would reduce dependency on oil, reducing tensions between the south and the north, but also lead to food security. The potential of South Sudan land has been realised and exploited so far by the gulf countries, India, China and even South Korea. These countries are buying or negotiating to buy huge areas of land to feed their own population needs, while South Sudan continues to be one of the countries heavily dependent on aid with over a million citizens currently receiving food aid. She goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Poverty is a catalyst for war. For example, tribal conflict arising from raiding cattle of neighbouring tribes is currently one of the challenges facing the South Sudan administration. As of yesterday, 300 people died in conflict resulting from cattle raiding. Australia can contribute great knowledge and skill in the agricultural sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She continued:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In Sudan a girl is more likely to die in child birth than complete primary school. Education in Sudan is desperately needed to break the cycle of poverty. Eighty-six per cent of girls have no formal education, 96.5 per cent cannot read or write more than their name, 99 per cent have no electricity, 98.5 per cent have no access to running water, 93 per cent have lost at least one family member, 68 per cent of married women live in a polygamist marriage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These statistics mean that women cannot sufficiently contribute to the political and economic life of the country and this can only disadvantage a country like Sudan, which really needs all hands on board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nyadol concludes by noting that 'investing in women, particularly in developing countries, is one of the most effective ways of aiding the development process'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to this remarkable young woman, Nyadol Nyuon, who has already endured and achieved so much on behalf of both of her beloved countries, Australia and South Sudan. I also note the enthusiasm of the Sudanese Australian community in general to contribute not only to Australia but also to the harmonious development of the new state of South Sudan. I am confident that Australia will do all it can to assist the 193rd member state of the United Nations to achieve its full potential.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RUDDOCK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I would not want the motion to lapse for want of a seconder, knowing that one was present. It is an important motion and I want to commend the member for Fremantle for raising this matter. I was fascinated with her comments. The only part she missed out was the fact that I, in an earlier life, had the opportunity to institute the program for resettlement of Sudanese refugees, but I am not sensitive about those matters. I only wish to observe that I was delighted to hear of the success of one of those people who came to Australia for resettlement through the front door. It is a particularly important program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very interesting that in one of the recent debates on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> there was a lady who put herself in the shoes of a refugee and went to Kakuma in particular where so many Southern Sudanese have been housed for so long. She saw a lot of the suffering that they endured and appreciated very much the fact that these were some of the people who do not have the funds to engage a people smuggler, are not free enough to travel and would remain there were it not for the fact that we did have a generous refugee resettlement program. I was delighted to hear of those comments and the acknowledgement in the motion. However, if I may, I want to focus on the broader points in this debate, because I think it is appropriate to acknowledge the fact that a new nation has emerged as a result of a referendum for the independence of Southern Sudan. There is now a unique opportunity for us to play a part in building the future of a new nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Fremantle, I am concerned that there have been continuing pressures and hostilities in some of the areas that have often been the subject of contest because of resources. One hopes that situation will not in any way deteriorate. I think it is important that Australia uses its aid to assist Southern Sudan in particular. There is a unique opportunity for us to be doing just that. Having recently visited Africa, I have made some comments about aid programs, and it germane to perhaps consider them in the context of this resolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Australia has some areas of expertise in which it can help in a unique way that others cannot. I have identified some of those programs in other parts of Africa. Australia's expertise in dry-land farming means that Australia can bring organisations like CSIRO to do research and assist in the development of those sorts of skills for feeding Africa's very large populations. It is a unique capacity and it is not something that others can do. I think there is insufficient emphasis on identifying those areas in which we can leverage our support. I had the opportunity of visiting a very marvellous Australian, Ms Hamlin, in Ethiopia. The leverage that you can have with an outstanding Australia who has made a commitment to Africa in the way in which she has is another matter on which you can build.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some time ago I suggested to the government that there was another area in which Australia was uniquely positioned to help. I raised it with the former member for Fraser Bob McMullen, who was then dealing with aid issues. I have heard nothing further from the Australian government in relation to it. However, I had the opportunity of meeting a very unique Southern Sudanese gentleman by the name of Henry Dang Dang. I met him at a conference organised by an organisation that was once known as Moral Re-Armament, which was of great interest to members for Fremantle. It is now called Initiatives of Change. That organisation brings people together who are going to be involved particularly in the process of reconciliation and nation building. Henry Dang Dang was one such person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of the elements of isolation that some people in Sudan feel because of the prosecution of the President for war crimes, there are issues which engage the United Nations about which both Sudan and Southern Sudan are unwilling to engage with the international community through the United Nations. Australia has had an enormous experience in dealing with demining, and dealing with issues in relation to rehabilitating populations who have been injured as a result of hostilities. It has done that in places such as Afghanistan and Cambodia. Henry Dang Dang, who was in charge of the issue of dealing with the rehabilitation of those wounded through hostilities and who was dealing with the issue of restoring capacity, reusing arable lands through demining, recognised that Australia could play a very unique role by bringing its expertise to bear where the international community was not able to be involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raised this with the government almost two years ago. We have been increasing very significantly our aid in relation to Africa. But there is an opportunity here with a new nation that we can develop a unique relationship with in the future that to date has not been picked up by the government. It disappoints me greatly. Henry Dang Dang was even willing to come to Australia to talk to our aid officials about the way in which they could engage in developing this initiative. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the minister and those who have responsibility for the aid program have been working behind the scenes on these issues and have not come back to me to tell me. It may be that that is the case. I would hope it is, but I suspect silence probably suggests that nothing has been done and that the opportunity is being fast lost. Here is a person who is of some influence in a new government saying to us, 'You are uniquely placed to be able to bring that tremendous experience that you have had in helping rebuild a nation that has been ravaged by war.' The reality is they cannot restore the capacity to be able to feed their own people unless they are able to demine those areas which have been so impacted by hostilities in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is going to be a significant disarmament of people who have been engaged in hostilities occurring. There is an opportunity to be able to help in that process. Of course, there are those who have been tragically afflicted by fighting who need to be assisted and aided. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to use this opportunity to congratulate the member for Fremantle on raising this issue. This is a unique opportunity for Australia and I hope all of us can say to the government now, as this nation builds its future, that Australia can link with them in a very special way. It is not just through the people that we have resettled who may be able to go back and play useful roles in rebuilding the nation; but by building up our linkages on those matters in which they have asked us to be engaged.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:20</span>):  Today I rise in support of the motion circulated by the member for Fremantle regarding the conflict in Sudan. I do thank her for bringing this important matter to our attention. On 9 July this year, following an overwhelming vote for independence by the people of Southern Sudan, two new nations emerged in what was an historic moment for Sudan and the African continent. Before, during and after the birth of the world's newest nation, Sudan had been gripped by civil war, famine and other humanitarian crises. Immediately after Sudan's referendum I made a commitment in this place to work with our local Sudanese support services in my electorate of Greenway to enhance the lives of Sudanese Australians. Today I would like to reaffirm this commitment and discuss the conflict that is plaguing the Sudanese region. I would also like to acknowledge the presence of the member for Chifley, whose electorate also shares a large number of Sudanese settlers in western Sydney. I am sure he shares that affirmation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the United Nations, since 2003 the conflict in Sudan has resulted in up to 300,000 people losing their lives as a result of violence, hunger and disease and almost three million people displaced. As indicated by the BBC, accurate figures are difficult to research and have made no distinction between those dying as a result of violence and those dying as a result of starvation or disease in the camps. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Resulting from disputes over land rights in the Darfur region of Sudan in 2003, the conflict has plagued the region for almost eight years. But as the US State Department outlines, Sudan has been at war with itself for more than three-quarters of its existence. Since independence in 1953, protracted conflict rooted in deep cultural and religious differences have slowed Sudan's economic and political development and caused massive internal displacement of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 September 2004, the then US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, told a foreign relations committee that genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring. Most recently, conflict has flared in the border region of Abyei causing mass displacement and loss of life. According to the United Nations, 100,000 people have fled the disputed region, causing a major humanitarian disaster. In April of this year Sudan's President said he would not recognise the South's independence unless it gave up the claim on Abyei  made in the South's draft constitution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As stated in the member's motion, insecurity and inaccessibility remain amongst the biggest challenges facing the delivery of assistance by humanitarian agencies to vulnerable populations. Earlier this year I said in this place that to ensure that South Sudan can prosper and remain a safe and productive nation; the Australian government must have an active role in the development of this young nation. I would like to turn to the Sudanese community in my local area, because this motion is of the utmost importance to the large and very active Sudanese community I represent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously mentioned the huge displacement that has been caused by the continuous conflict in Sudan. This displacement is very tangibly evident in Blacktown. I am reminded of this when I attend Blacktown City Council citizenship ceremonies in particular, which regularly comprise a large number of proud Sudanese born people who have chosen to call Australia home. This large Sudanese community makes a tremendous contribution to the multicultural fabric of our electorate. However, any new Australian citizens who have come from scenes of extreme violence in their homeland will of course unfortunately always find it difficult to feel truly included in their new homeland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Blacktown community there are a number of leaders in multicultural services who are committed to addressing these very serious issues surrounding our newest Sudanese Australians. I would like to mention a few of them. St Patrick's Blacktown parish priest, Father Peter Confeggi, operates a service that deals with Sudanese Australian youth. Fr Confeggi works with members of the Sudanese community to ensure that young Sudanese Australians do not fall into traps of antisocial behaviour but are instead included and accepted in wider society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Blacktown Police Superintendent Mark Wright works with Sudanese community leaders to ensure that young Sudanese Australians do not become involved in antisocial or illegal activity. Superintendent Wright has told me that we can do all we can in terms of sporting and other community initiatives to contribute to inclusive behaviour. Indeed, this has been successful in contributing to the betterment of the Sudanese community in Blacktown. However, his view is that there is a real risk of the next generation, the generation being affected by the most recent fighting in Sudan, falling into patterns of unacceptable behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month I was joined by the Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs at Sydwest Multicultural Services in Blacktown to launch a new federally funded program designed to encourage good social behaviour in public spaces with a particular focus on our new settlement communities. The reality is individual members of the public often make judgments about specific nationalities unfortunately in an often generalised way based on behaviours they observe in public spaces, be it Blacktown Mall, WestPoint Blacktown Shopping Centre or around Blacktown station, and the behaviours of some often determine how members of the wider community judge the whole. Sydwest does a fantastic job in helping new Australians, including many Sudanese Australians, to become established in their new homeland. I am confident that this new program will lead to positive outcomes in our local area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously mentioned in this place Blacktown resident and President of the Equatorial Community Welfare Association of New South Wales, Mr Faustino Aboka, who lost seven family members during the civil war in Sudan. He now calls Blacktown his home and works as a role model for new Sudanese Australians in our local area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these people work to ensure that the Sudanese Australian community are embraced in the local community of western Sydney in particular and are able to live and work in their new homeland. All of these community leaders have expressed concerns to me regarding the most recent fighting in the contested region of Abyei in particular, and I made a commitment to them that I would continue to raise this issue with Foreign Minister Rudd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity also to mention the devastating humanitarian crisis unfolding currently in the Horn of Africa. East Africa is currently experiencing the worst drought in 60 years. According to UNICEF, in Southern Somalia a famine has been declared and some 600,000 children are on the brink of death suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The world is currently witnessing one of the worst natural disasters ever and of course we cannot stand by idly and do nothing. I thank the Foreign Minister for his rapid response to this crisis and note that Australia is currently the world's fourth largest country donor to the Horn of Africa, providing more than $88 million. However, we can never afford to be trapped by the perils of indifference and I encourage everyone in this place to do whatever they can to help the people of East Africa in their time of need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I again thank the member for Fremantle for bringing these important issues to the attention of the house. As set out in item 7 of the member's motion, I believe we here are all of the same mind, that this government needs to provide ongoing and predictable, diplomatic and funding resources to address humanitarian and development needs in North and South Sudan. I also reaffirm my commitment to the Sudanese population living in my electorate and thank the various community leaders in Greenway for all their hard work in ensuring that these new Australians are included constructively in our society.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to support this motion in relation to South Sudan. It is a community with which I have had a great deal of involvement over a number of years now. In particular, it goes back to 2007 when, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, I was charged with the case of George Forbes. George Forbes was an Australian contractor in South Sudan. There was a tragic suicide of another contractor from Eastern Europe. Mr Forbes was set up—and I say this as somebody who is very cautious about overseas legal proceedings; but there was no question that this was a case of suicide—and the local authorities found that, and then there was a random decision to prosecute. Mr Forbes was held in a local prison in desperate circumstances and was facing not just the death penalty but potentially death through illness in horrific prison circumstances prior to that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mobilised the Australian ambassador from Cairo at the time, Bob Bowker, who did a tremendous job. He lived in a tent and a mud brick hut in two different parts of South Sudan. He worked with the South Sudanese authorities. We also brought to bear an Australian legal team led by Julian McMahon from Melbourne, a friend of mine from university years who has become an outstanding human rights barrister, among other things, in Melbourne. As well, we brought together a team from Door of Hope. Door of Hope is a Melbourne-based church charity group. They have a particular focus in southern Sudan because at that time southern Sudan was not independent and Door of Hope, led by Bryan Grasby and introduced to me through my great friend Andrew Heard, has long been doing on-the-ground practical work through things such as assisting in providing brick-making facilities and local support. They have built great links, trust and confidence with the southern Sudanese authorities as that country moved towards independence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was critical was that at a time when the government, through the Australian ambassador, was doing all it could to get Mr Forbes a release, things became quite dramatic. Mr Forbes's health deteriorated and, had it not been for the intervention through Brian Grasby direct to the general secretary of the southern Sudanese authorities, it would have been almost impossible to have had justice done and Mr Forbes may well have perished in the southern Sudanese jail before he had a chance to face the courts and to be appropriately cleared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What then occurred was that Brian Grasby rang the general secretary of the southern Sudanese authorities and explained the situation that there was not a question of doubt, but a manifest, clear, absolute injustice and that the life of an Australian was in imminent threat through illness. Mr Forbes was guaranteed release and given time in hospital where he was able to recover. In the meantime the legal proceedings were conducted at a higher court of authority. The submission by Julian McMahon, through local lawyers, on behalf of Mr Forbes was adopted in large part as the reasoning and rationale of the court, which gave a complete clearance—a complete quashing—of the lower court's verdict. Mr Forbes was released with a perfectly clear record and with the finding that there was a manifest injustice, that this was a clear case of suicide and that there was absolutely no relationship to Mr Forbes. So the life of an Australian contractor who had been helping to develop a country which was going through a course of development, attempting to move from the extreme and grinding poverty which had characterised southern Sudan, was saved. For that, I thank both the Australian ambassador at the time, Bob Bowker, and also in particular Brian Grasby; his assistant Michelle; Andrew Heard for the connection, and for all of those involved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a precursor to the path through which southern Sudan has subsequently travelled. It provided a basis for the Australian government, through successive Prime Ministers, to engage with the southern Sudanese authorities. As part of the confidence building program, it was subsequently agreed that the Australian government would assist in judicial training and judicial information, in particular to help the lower courts develop standards, structures and training sufficient that no such case of manifest justice would occur again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The result, however, has been far more positive than any of us would have hoped at the time. Southern Sudan has been through a process of a plebiscite on national independence. That was overwhelmingly passed by the population. The country has come into being as of 9 July. I appreciate the work of the foreign minister's chief of staff, Philip Green, in facilitating the project put forward by Door of Hope for a brick-making facility to be part of Australia's independence gift. It is real. It is practical. It will help create local jobs as well as create local construction and development. These are the simple and practical things that are good examples of the Australian aid program in action. They certainly beat financial support direct to governments where there is not necessarily control over the funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking forward, South Sudan has a difficult road to hope. Let us be absolutely clear about that. It is a road which will have to overcome drought and famine within the region. It will have to overcome the problems of potential military conflict with its northern neighbour in terms of the rump of Sudan, which still remains under an authoritarian leader and an authoritarian government with a bent towards sharia law which in the Darfur province to the west of the country has presided over a catastrophic and tragic famine with huge human input in the form of the treatment of the local people. Fortunately, southern Sudan is now independent. It is responsible for its own future. It has that opportunity, but it will not be easy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the plus side, however, it has significant oil resources and it appears that there is yet to be a full post-succession arrangement for oil between Juba, the capital of southern Sudan and Khartoum in the remaining rump of what was previously Sudan and comprises the northern Sudanese area now. I understand there are also many mineral resources of great potential. I hope that there is a transparent process of freeing up those resources in a way which guarantees local community development, which does not lead to unbridled environmental impact, which is done through processes that provide long-term stable revenues to the development of the country, and that it avoids any corruption. There needs to be transparency in southern Sudan and I think one important investment from Australia would be to ensure that the processes for future tendering, for future mineral leases, are conducted through as open, transparent and non-corrupt bureaucratic and tendering mechanisms as possible. That would be a fair and reasonable place which would get opposition support if Australia were to dedicate some post-independence resources out of its aid program, as well as in the direct aid. If we can marshal the resources of that country in a way which helps the people then we can truly give southern Sudan a way forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Bryan Grasby, Bob Bowker, Andrew Heard and all involved for their long history of supporting this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:38</span>):  The member for Fremantle has certainly endeavoured in this resolution to cover the full gamut of Sudan's issues, from the incursions by the infamous Lords' Resistance Army from Uganda to the situation in Darfur and the Janjaweed, a militia which is supposedly independent but is essentially armed and financed by the government of Sudan, to the question of South Sudan's recent independent announcement and the long-term problems of this nation. They are all included in this resolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sudan, of course, has multiple issues confronting it. Its under-five mortality is 112 per 1,000 people. Ninety per cent of the nation lives on less than $1 per day and its maternal mortality is infamous, indeed, with 2,000-plus women out of every 100,000 dying in child birth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to Darfur, there has been a wide variety of estimates of how many have perished in this conflict. The World Health Organisation at one stage quoted 50,000. A British parliamentary inquiry has estimated 300,000, but the Lancet magazine, the famous British medical magazine, in January 2010 said that there was a 95 per cent confidence that the numbers were between 178,000 and 461,000. By any person's estimates, a significant number of people that have perished and, as I said, historically it is the so-called militias. There are issues, of course, between herders and between agriculturalists. There is, of course, an Arab negroid divide within the country, but it is essentially a regime that is excoriated throughout the world. The Bashir regime is, indeed, perpetrating most of these problems. The number of times in which military vehicles have been traceable to the regime and the number of times that armaments have been traced to them is on the public record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also be historically concerned about Russia's continued violation of arms embargoes instituted by the United Nations. That has not helped the situation. There have been the disguised Russian purchased planes—disguised in actual fact as UN planes—that have participated in this conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Historically, the government in the north has instigated an Arab apartheid style process, discriminating very intensely against those people who are essentially of negroid extraction, whether they be animist or Christian or indeed, in some cases, fellow Muslims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion recognises the recent independence of South Sudan, which I think we are all pleased was the outcome of the 2005 Peace Settlement. Throughout the whole period there have been grave doubts that the regime in Khartoum would honour its agreement and, of course, in this last year there have been border conflicts around areas where there are issues as to the population balance, but also issues towards access to resources. It has been positive that a country with Juba as a capital with 8¼ million people has been established. It has been recognised internationally and, as the previous speaker indicated, there has been aid assistance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This, of course, is a very complex country. Probably one of my continuing memories is to attend with my colleague the member for Parramatta a riverside theatre event about five years ago with 500 people attending where there were 30-plus dance troops from different Sudanese ethnic groups. I had a little boy sitting next to me, about five years of age, and his mouth was agape. He could not believe the diversity of people from his own land. He could not understand how he could be a Sudanese from a particular tribal group and yet these people are there so different from him. It was far beyond an Albanian looking at an Estonian folkloric group in Europe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously the country is dealing with issues of illiteracy and poverty. It is a country that has been put together around colonial boundaries and past European conflicts. It has very significant problems, but these are not assisted by the continuing attitudes of the regime in the north, a regime which, as I indicated, is under a number of international bans and which continues to interfere in other parts of the nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (11:43):  Riverina has a large Sudanese community and its members have contributed much to our culture. There were plenty of smiles for independence when the local celebrations of the declaration of South Sudan as the world's newest nation were held in Wagga Wagga on Saturday, 16 July, just a week after independence was officially recognised. In fact, of the many events that I have attended in my first year of parliament, this was one of the most joyous. There was sheer delight, spontaneity and a feeling of togetherness at the function. People from all walks of life joined for an afternoon of music, dance and delicious food at a get together like no other. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sudanese certainly know how to enjoy themselves. There was plenty of colour and movement as the choir comprising Acol Abuk, Apuol Tong, Susan Tong and Grace Wani performed traditional songs and then joined in the dancing. Soon everyone was on their feet, young and old, clapping hands, raising arms, swirling around and getting into the mood and the exuberant spirit. There was much to be happy about. Before the real action began a discourse on Sudan's troubled history was given. To listen made you really appreciate why the people of South Sudan are so gratified, proud and relieved they have achieved independence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Riverina has played an enormous role in multiculturalism in Australia. In fact, Griffith in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area is the cradle of multiculturalism. People from all over the world, from countries where daily conflict and age old civil war is a way of life ended up at Griffith not long after irrigation opened up the area 99 years ago. Today Griffith is the showpiece for Australian multiculturalism. On 26 January this year, 90 flags representing the nations from which Griffiths's people originate flew proudly at the city's Australia Day ceremony. Next year the new ensign for South Sudan will flap proudly in the breeze.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the Riverina's Sudanese community are proud people. They are caring, good people. At the Wagga Wagga independence day commemoration some powerful messages were given about tolerance, community contribution and acceptance. The aspect that I liked most about the day was the involvement of the youngsters. They were included and they showed that the day meant much to them. They are the ones who will bridge the divide between cultures. It is already being done on many levels, not least of which is sport. The Sudanese have already shown their proficiency in football, both soccer and the great game we invented, Australian Rules. Sudanese are a tall people and their speed and height will be assets to Aussie Rules. You certainly cannot deny they have other attributes which contribute to play the code, and I speak of toughness. South Sudan's independence underlines just how tough, how determined and how fiercely committed its people are to change to a better way of life to the future—their future, our future, a shared future, a shared vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2007 census there were just 46 Sudanese people included in the Wagga Wagga statistics. That number has grown. One of Wagga Wagga's Sudanese refugees is Constance Okot, who took an active part in the local 16 July festivities. She came to my home town, a place she now, too, calls home after fleeing war-ravaged Sudan. She came to Wagga Wagga to escape a life in which each day was filled with uncertainty, fear and an overwhelming sense of dread. She did not know whether she or those nearest and dearest to her would see through each day or whether they would still be alive tomorrow or the next day. What a dreadful way to live your life!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not exaggerate. It has not been an easy transition for Constance and other Sudanese people. It has had its challenges, its upheavals, but Constance is a person of faith, of hope. She wants to try to ensure that refugees assimilate into Australian society. She wants to dispel the public perception that it cannot work. Constance is working hard to improve the image of her fellow refugees locally. She made an appearance on SBS TV's <span style="font-style:italic;">Cutting Edge,</span> which examined the life of refugees when they reach Australia, and she also spoke with Chris Coleman on ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Riverina Mornings</span>. How does she like Wagga? 'Things are really nice', she said. 'Things are good. Very different to Sudan. First, when I came here it was like a dream. In Wagga, when I wake up every day I'm very happy. I have a lot of friends; a lot of people who are supporting me. Very happy to be in Wagga.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On how hard it is to fit into Australian society she said, 'Everybody has a different view or understanding of where to put themselves on where they belong. Everywhere in the world, everywhere you go we can see animals. They're different because they are animals, but you may find when there are new animals, when a sheep is brought in, they will not like that sheep immediately. It is similar for humans. It's normal for human beings. It's up to us to find how to fit in. This is my home. I've decided to be here, to be part of this town or city or whatever.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On when she found her family, 'Just like a dream', she said. 'You thought you were the only person remaining in the family, then you find somebody still alive.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people forget their name, their age and the names of their children. Ask a Sudanese and most of them are born on 1 January or 25 December. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:48</span>):  I want to start by thanking the member for Fremantle for facilitating this discussion by moving what is a very important motion. Although it can sometimes be difficult to keep precisely abreast of the conflict in North and South Sudan and the region, given communication problems in the area, it is clear that escalating violence in the region is continuing to cause an unacceptable growth in mass displacement and appalling rates of death. As we have heard, the situation in southern Kordofan, on the border of North and South Sudan is particularly dire at the moment and has not improved since conflict broke out on 6 June in advance of the scheduled independence of South Sudan on 9 July. Other members have expanded on this matter and I add my support to calls for a ceasefire, which is after all the only path towards sustainable peace and political stability in that state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that Australia has the unambiguous responsibility to support South Sudan, the world's newest nation, as it establishes itself in the region. We also have a responsibility to do our part in ensuring that the facilitation of peace in the areas abutting South Sudan, including most urgently the southern Kordofan, Dafur and Blue Nile regions of Sudan, is resourced and to that end I cannot emphasise how important it is that the government takes heed of the final calls of the member for Fremantle's motion and provides ongoing and predictable diplomatic and funding resources to address humanitarian development needs in the two countries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the distance between the region and Australia, our country can and must do two things. The first has been embraced. I am proud, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the extent to which Australians and local communities helped to facilitate the recent South Sudan independence referendum here in Australia. It is testament to the strength of the South Sudanese Australian communities and to the cooperation of the IOM, humanitarian crisis hub, AusAID, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that over the Christmas and New Year's break last year on the request from my office, an extra $15,000 was secured and logistics arranged with local communities to facilitate the transport of eligible voters from South Australia and Tasmania to Melbourne, given that there were no polling booths in those states. The Yes vote in Melbourne was one of the highest in Australia and we assisted the community in creating and then in helping celebrate those results. I have been proud to report to this house from time to time the ways in which the Sudanese community in my electorate and in Victoria have worked together and drawn energy from what has been an historic campaign for independence. But our attention also needs to turn back to the plight of those for whom violence and unrest is a daily reality and to now concentrate on the second means with which we, as a wealthy and stable democracy, can assist them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future stability of Sudan and South Sudan was never going to be guaranteed through the independence vote alone. What is happening in the north and the border areas adjoining it require our attention. We cannot take our eyes off the fact that on 9 July two nations were created. If we are intending to be consistent with our continued support for South Sudan and the referendum process, we must play our part within the international community to take action now while a political process is still possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also in a position, as part of the international community, to provide aid to the millions of people in Sudan who are facing increasingly high levels of food insecurity right now. I recognise the statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in recent times regarding Australia's share of the required aid to Sudan but, noting that Australia will be required to provide appropriate development assistance for years to come and noting that the provision of emergency humanitarian support is now paramount, I urge the government to do all it can to increase its humanitarian support for those displaced by this terrible conflict. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another form of support that we can provide that became apparent to me over the course of the last several years that I have been working in Melbourne with members of the South Sudanese community. Many people have come here from South Sudan seeking to create their life here. As the member for Riverina said, there are many, many people who now want to call Australia their home and lead a peaceful life making a productive contribution to their community. Many of them are getting on with that. It may not often be seen as such from the media reports but that represents the overwhelming majority of desires of South Sudanese living here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there also many who have come to Australia, attracted by its democratic values, who while in Australia have played a very important role in fostering democracy in their home country. I am very pleased that several members of the Melbourne electorate are in fact in South Sudan right now assisting with the creation and establishment of a stable democratic government. I think it is something that, as Australians, we can be extraordinarily proud of that not only can we provide a home and refuge to people but we can also provide a crucible from which democratic values can spread across the world. I put on record the Greens' support for this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion on the independence of South Sudan. It was only fairly recently—this morning—that I was provided with this opportunity, but as someone who represents such great suburbs as Ballajura, Koondoola and Girrawheen, places where a number of those who have come to our great country from South Sudan reside, I do however welcome the opportunity to speak. Across the suburbs of Cowan and particularly in the south of Cowan, as I said we do have a number of those that hail from South Sudan. They came under the humanitarian visa system that was provided by the last federal government and we certainly welcome the contribution they have made. </span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">At a very good church that is based within Koondoola, the Flaming Evangelical Church, I have had the opportunity to meet those members of the church who are from the south of Sudan. As other speakers have said, they have welcomed the opportunity to come to Australia and take up the freedoms and the opportunities that this country has provided to them. They have made a good contribution. Whilst it has not always been a smooth path for all people who have come from Sudan, as has been said, the vast majority are very good, law-abiding people who have come here wishing to take up those opportunities. </span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">It is only relatively recently that the times of autonomy within Sudan for the south and now, just in recent weeks, the independence of the south have provided greater hope for the people of Sudan. As we know, the north of Sudan has dominated the country for many years and their system of policies are discriminatory and negative in a lot of ways. But autonomy and now independence have provided the opportunity for the people of South Sudan to flourish. </span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">We know that it is a fairly subsistence type of  economy, very rural in its nature. But we also know that 80 per cent of the oil reserves of Sudan are based in the south and this, of course, provides a great opportunity for the wealth of the south to make a positive contribution to the future. It is a very positive future that we see for South Sudan. Even the plans to move the capital from Juba into the Lakes State, the more central part of South Sudan, really is the epitome of a country that sees the future as all very positive and so we welcome that.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">Although there are some eight million people who live in South Sudan—and barring comments about whether the past censuses have been accurate, or whatever—it does mean that the opportunities to share in this wealth that will be redistributed from the arrangements of the past, where the north basically sucked up all the wealth from the south, so you can see that there will be greater opportunities now in the future. It has also been said in other places that the infant mortality rate of 112 deaths for every 1,000 is far too high. The maternal mortality rate of over 2,000 deaths for every 100,000 live births is just far too high.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">But within Cowan, and for those that hail from South Sudan and Sudan in general, those people have decided that their future lies here in Australia. It has always been the case that we welcome them. We welcome the positive contributions that they make. We welcome them in places like Koondoola Primary School where the intensive language school operates very strongly for them. We welcome the positive contributions the Flaming Evangelical Church makes in Koondoola as well. I see a great and positive future for the South Sudanese in Cowan and I see an excellent future for South Sudan, and the government should continue to back them strongly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alcohol consumption in Australia is a widely accepted and long-standing part of our culture. It features in special celebrations. It is what we do to celebrate winning, a birth, even deaths. It is an important adjunct to dining out and it is a true marker of hospitality and friendly interaction amongst many populations and most individuals in Australia. What you drink, when you drink and how much alcohol you consume is supposed to mark you as a sophisticate or a knockabout type. Getting drunk, for some, for the first time is a rite de passage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Drinking a little alcohol is not a health problem. It is, however, if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. If you drink when you are pregnant you are literally gambling with the welfare of your unborn child. Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the term used to describe a range of physical, mental, behavioural and learning disabilities that are a direct result of consuming alcohol during pregnancy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alcohol can harm an unborn baby in different ways at different times during a pregnancy. Alcohol is a neurotoxin and teratogin, meaning it is an agent which can cause birth defects and permanent brain damage in the foetus. The alcohol deprives the developing brain of oxygen and destroys the brain cells which in turn affects the growth, the structure and the function of the brain in the newborn. Alcohol consumption will affect the developing cells and organs differently depending on the stages of the pregnancy. In the first three months when the baby's organs are being formed alcohol exposure can cause a smaller head, heart defects, limb damage, bone formation defects, kidney damage, eye problems, hearing problems and facial abnormalities. All or some of these outcomes may result. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the 2009 National Health and Medical Research Council's recommendations are for zero alcohol consumption for women who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Tragically, these recommendations are a best-kept secret when it comes to many women and some health service professionals who should know better than to assure pregnant women that 'a little bit will not hurt you'. Some Australian research undertaken in 2006 found 34 per cent of women consumed alcohol in Australia in their most recent pregnancy. Other researchers suggested this figure could be as high as 60 per cent. In a 2003 survey at Lyell McEwen Hospital in South Australia, 80 per cent, or 70 women in all, reported consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Recent surveys have shown us rates of risky drinking are increasing in non-Indigenous women in Western Australian women of child-bearing age. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">FASD is not curable. However, with early diagnosis and special support, children and adults with this condition can be helped to a better life. Our motion is about supporting as much as communicating and making sure those who should be delivering services to those in need are better resourced and know the job they have to do. The carers can be supported to have a better life and to have better strategies as they try to manage the condition in their loved ones, a condition which is incurable and lifelong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion, which is bipartisan supported, aims to lift the lid on the effects of alcohol on the unborn and put the problem squarely in the limelight. We need to move away from the nonsense about a little bit will not hurt and have women and their partners understand that for nine months at least it is important not to gamble with the future, the lifetime of your child. We have pretended that drinking while you are pregnant is not a problem for far too long. We have ignored what Canada, the United States and most other developed nations have recognised and have been substantially investing in for years, and that is programs to educate and inform, programs to diagnose and programs to support those who are affected by FASD. We have a population of damaged children who are being misdiagnosed and misunderstood. Many of them are incarcerated and they remain unsupported because the condition is not acknowledged for the purposes of disability support. Our motion calls on that support to be given.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our police and courts, teachers, doctors, nurses and other health service professionals are not sufficiently educated to understand the condition and its effects on individuals. Some may be, but are embarrassed to tell a mother of a newborn in difficulty that it was her drinking that may have caused the problem. Therefore there is much misdiagnosis and children with FASD are often labelled instead as autistic. This does not help when it comes to support services. We must understand that in order to change the rights of a child to be born without a preventable disability we have to make sure there is no misinformation in the community and no lack of understanding about what has to be done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  As I was saying before the division, this motion calls for support for those with FASD and their carers. Effective support includes special education, vocational programs, special tutoring and structured environments to minimise the distress, particularly in relation to antisocial behaviour and lifelong care. This motion calls for a national communications effort that will ensure that every woman and girl is aware of the connection between alcohol consumption and the chance that their baby will be born with incurable and permanent brain and other damage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems in our country is that young girls are increasingly likely to binge drink. Those young girls put themselves into a situation where they may become pregnant and often it is many months before they realise their pregnancy. This of course is a serious problem for the unborn, for the developing foetus if those girls continue to drink, in particular to binge drink, during that first trimester. That is why it is so important that we have our population understanding the impacts, the connections between alcohol and developing foetuses and the fact that no drinking is indeed the only way to be absolutely sure that your child will not be affected by alcohol as it grows and develops in the womb. As I said before, the problem at the moment is that we have a growing culture of younger girls drinking and at the same time behaving in higher risk situations, also taking drugs and certainly not using contraception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have some wine and beer companies voluntarily adding health warnings to their alcohol containers, bottles and cans. We need all of the sellers of alcohol to do that. It is an irony that in Australia we have some companies who have been exporting their wine for years in particular to California and other places in the United States adding the label warning that alcohol is a danger when pregnant but not using such a label in Australia. We need young Australians approaching puberty to understand the connections and we need to offer support to women and girls with a drinking problem who may become pregnant. We need also to ensure that their partners and boys of the same age—in fact the whole of our population—understands the connections between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the dangers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have not mentioned Indigenous drinking to this point and nor do I want ever to let it be understood or believed that FASD is a problem specifically of Indigenous communities or populations throughout the world, because it is not. But the realities are that a lot of our Indigenous communities are drinking to excess. Alcohol is a real problem for a lot of our women and girls in Indigenous communities. I commend the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and also this federal government, because already there are some incidence surveys being undertaken in places like Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek in Western Australia where the women of those communities have understood the damage being done by alcohol to their generations and have asked for support, firstly, in identifying how many of their children are affected and then how those children can be better supported to live as good a life as possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy for Indigenous communities is that their culture is transmitted through oral tradition and learning. It is not book learning. It is not a written down culture. If a generation of young children or a big number of them cannot learn, cannot in fact remember, or become fluent in reading, cannot participate in a ceremony and the traditional knowledge that they are expected as Aboriginal people to understand and transmit, if that cannot happen then it is in fact another form of cultural genocide. I think it is extraordinarily important that we understand that for Indigenous communities, particularly traditional Indigenous communities still with their culture, that they are given special help to make sure that alcohol is not the problem it now is.Women, whether or not they are Indigenous, need to be given special support if in fact they have a drinking problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly commend this motion. I also commend Ministers Macklin and Nicola Roxon, who have supported this motion in the discussion. I am very grateful for the bipartisan support that we have had both in the Senate and now I trust in the House of Representatives. This is a problem that belongs to all Australians. It is one that has probably been with us since 1788. It is a problem that has no cure once a child has in fact been born with the effects of alcohol consumption, but it is a problem that we can prevent in the future and we can make sure those with the condition of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder have a better life, because there is better support possible for them and better understanding of their condition.</span>

I thank the member for Murray and my other colleagues the member for Moore and the member for Blair for supporting this motion, as it was supported in the Senate.

                  <span class="HPS-Time">Foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, or FASD, is an umbrella term for a range of disabilities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. The syndrome was first described in 1973 by two paediatric dysmorphologists in the USA, Kenneth Jones and David Smith. That study and further research of FAS has identified three additional less severe syndromes known as FASD, or foetal alcohol syndrome disorders. These are: foetal alcohol effects, foetal alcohol related birth disorders and alcohol related neurodevelopment disorders. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">The true prevalence of FASD in Australia is unknown, as the member for Murray pointed out earlier, and is believed to be chronically underreported in part due to the lack of agreed clinical guidelines and also a lack of understanding among both medical professionals and the general population about the risks of consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Indeed, there is an ambiguity to it. We have heard evidence from people who have spoken to our support group that some medical practitioners, for example, </span>believe it is still okay to have some alcohol whilst being pregnant. Most of the evidence is clearly indicating that no alcohol is the preferred desired behaviour, but it is a message that is only slowly being taken on board even by the medical profession itself. We know that a lot of work is being done with midwives, for example, in trying to fully understand and explore this insidious disorder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Data suggests that prevalence rates of FAS in Australia are between 0.06 and 0.68 per 1,000 live births in the general population. I know my friend the member for Blair has far more detailed information on this, but among Indigenous Australians it is between 2.76 and 4.7 per 1,000 births. Most accept these rates are under ascertained due to poor and ad hoc information, and indeed the limited skills and capacities in detection and diagnosis and the multiple barriers faced by women seeking help.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I may, I would like quote from NOFASARD, a publication dealing with FAS, from June 2011. It quotes a research papers under the heading, 'Australia's first screening and diagnostic service for children with alcohol related birth defects could be up and running by the end of the year.' It goes on to state: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Elizabeth Elliott, Professor of Paediatrics and Child Health of the Children's Hospital, said it was hard to know exactly how many children were affected by FASD because of lack of research and diagnostic clinics. However, she estimates that at least two per cent of all Australian babies are born with FASD each year. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That is likely a significant underestimate because doctors are not recognising it and are not asking women about alcohol use in pregnancy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is as simple as that; they are not even asking. The consequences of that are absolutely considerable on all levels. If it does not register in terms of health and the social consequences, it will and would on the economic level, because they are very considerable. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that FASD affects one per cent of all live births in the USA, for example, and FAS specifically affects between 0.5 and two per 1,000 births in the USA. The prevalence of FAS is much higher in terms of rates in some other countries such as South Africa, where it is quite extraordinary and is estimated to affect between 68 to 89.2 per cent per 1,000 children in Cape Province, for example. The same publication I noted earlier states South Africa has the highest recorded rate of foetal alcohol syndrome in the world, affecting more than one million residents, and is being urged to take action against the preventable medical condition, the impact of which has been labelled as devastating as HIV. HIV is recognised and known now. What we are talking about is something as prevalent and yet unknown or greatly misdiagnosed. The country has the highest recorded rate of foetal alcohol syndrome in the world that we know of. The country's leading experts estimate more than one million South Africans have been damaged by their mother's drinking while they were pregnant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads us to this undeniable fact, that FASD are preventable but are incurable and require a lifetime of care and support. So, FASD, as I mentioned, are preventable, it is incurable and it is a lifetime sentence. That is a significant statement about a behaviour that we can get rid of or we can stop. It really does beggar belief that we allow this to continue. Our support group demonstrated this in this chamber today, and many others are working towards eradicating this. This is just totally and utterly unacceptable. FASD are a leading cause of preventable non-genetic birth defects and intellectual disability in Australia—and I will repeat it—preventable non-genetic birth defects and intellectual disability, but it does not even officially rate as a disability. Our motion calls on our government—indeed all parties—to support this and recognise it as a disability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While FASD is a leading cause of non-genetic intellectual disability, another major issue of concern is that the majority—that is, 75 per cent to 80 per cent of people—living with an FASD actually have a normal IQ but struggle with everyday living skills making accessing developmental disability services very difficult. Foetal alcohol syndrome is often considered to be the most serious of the disorders within the spectrum. A person living with FAS will have a brain injury, impaired growth, neurological deficits and facial dysmorphology. The difficulties experienced by people with FASD can include difficulty with mathematical concepts; time and handling money, thinking things through and learning from experiencing, understanding consequences of their actions or the concepts of cause and effect, difficulty with social skills, difficulty storing and retrieving information, including following instructions, and finally impulsivity and distractibility—all basic living skills and all behavioural issues that we can affect. By not drinking during pregnancy we can bring this to a halt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I will conclude by just pointing out as I did earlier that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder does not have a disability status in Australia. The situation relegates this condition to the status of non-entity; minimises public perception and service provider perception of the real scope of the problem, perpetuates belief in the limited risks posed by lower doses of alcohol, and fails to acknowledge the rate of incidents that has been contrasted to other non-genetic causes. Having it registered as a disability in Australia brings credibility to at least four decades of contemporary knowledge and research on alcohol as both a teratogen and a substance toxic to healthy foetal development. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (12<span class="HPS-Time">:52</span>):  I rise to support the motion proposed by the member for Murray and supported by the member for Braddon and the member for Blair, and to acknowledge the advice and support provided by Anne Russell from the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome and Related Disorders, NOFASARD, as the previous member noted. In the absence of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD, prevalence study in Australia it is difficult to convince government or the public on the significant risk this issue poses for Australia. Dr Elizabeth Elliott, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> on 20 June this year has suggested Western nations might well have a prevalence rate of somewhere between two and five per cent. This is based on epidemiological research in 2009 by Dr Philip May and colleagues in the USA. What is more accepted is an increasing incidence of FASD linked to better detection, the momentum of FASD awareness in North America and better preparedness of service providers to respond to the needs of children and education and social support services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a current prevalence research study called the Lililwan Project in Fitzroy Crossing in northern Western Australia investigating FASD in this Australian Aboriginal community. It was initiated as a consequence of community lobbying and the need for an evidence base to support local prevention strategies. Multidisciplinary teams have been engaged to conduct assessment and diagnosis, record data and provide case planning for optimum outcomes for children. Data from this project will provide invaluable information on the prevalence of FASD in Aboriginal communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical to support any community where FASD is overrepresented, but it is also critical that we do not lose sight of the reality that FASD is not just an Indigenous issue. Alcohol consumption in Australia is not limited to Aboriginal communities. There is ample evidence to support high rates of alcohol consumption in the non-Indigenous community. International comparisons show that Australians consume 8.89 litres; Canadians 7.7 litres and the US 8.44 litres per capita each year, and to determine prevalence a much wider study needs to be undertaken. Some suggest that over 200,000 Australians may be affected by FASD, and that means one in 100 live births. This rate is higher than the incidences of autism, Aspergers, ADHD and Down's syndrome. It is likely that FASD could be the most common preventable type of intellectual disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second critical factor is the reliance on IQ as a measurement of disability. Seventy-five to eighty per cent of patients with FASD have been found to have an IQ in the normal range. Average or higher IQ scores often preclude special needs funding and/or service opportunities. In addition, the inherent limitations of a traditional IQ test restricts their usefulness in directing effective strategies. A study on the relationship between FASD and IQ undertaken by the University of Alaska has found that fewer than 35 per cent of individuals with FASD would have qualified for special education, given the criterion of an IQ under 71. For people with FASD an IQ assessment will not identify the often uniquely individual presentation of disabilities nor the seriousness of the brain damage. Whilst a diagnosis of foetal alcohol syndrome may rely on facial dysmorphology, there remains the conundrum of distinguishing other conditions within the spectrum. Particular skills and training required to accurately assess executive or adaptive functioning and the involvement of neurophysiology and occupational therapy. </span>

                  </a>  I will continue. Speech and language therapy is critical. The adverse effects of foetal alcohol exposure also mean that there needs to be investigating and planning for social support systems in the post-diagnosis period to account for cognitive and developmental disabilities. The National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome and the Related Disorders, advocates for patients and carers, state that many who contact NOFASARD identify the barrier created by IQ as well as a determining factor in diagnosis, and seek support for those in their care where maternal alcohol use is presented as reliable evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are multiple implications across the lifespan for any individual living with FASD. Although brain damage has a profound effect on behaviour, it is a problem behaviour that often leads to stereotyping. Most working in health and human services, education, justice and other service provision areas have not yet developed an understanding of the learning and memory impairments, the poor judgement skills and the poor consequential thinking abilities, the limited skills in making friends and maintaining relationships, which are often the hallmarks of FASD. Service providers have not had appropriate training and have limited perception of the power of labels like 'belligerent, defiant, lazy and uncommitted to individual change'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month, August 2011, the FASD Australian collaboration will present a national diagnostic and screening protocol. Once applied, accurate diagnosis contributes to better detection, improved data collection and most importantly the opportunity for early intervention, not just to support the individual, but in the case of children, more appropriate support for parents. An older sibling's diagnosis with FASD is one of the more powerful indicators of future exposed pregnancies and a critical point for prevention.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something powerful and at the same time threatening in listing FASD as a recognised disability. While it brings credibility to at least four decades of contemporary knowledge in alcohol as both teratogenic and toxic to healthy foetal development, it brings another dimension to the harms alcohol causes in society. There is no defence of choice where an unborn child is concerned. There is no evidence that this disability is a burden of some population groups and there is no avoidance or opportunity to mask the condition by proposing it as another malady with unknown cause. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been resistance to the call for listing FASD as a disability and Australia has the opportunity to lead the world in legitimising the claim. To do less will continue to fill our prisons, absorb child protection and out-of-home placement resources, overload special education, overwhelm parents and supporters who are doing it tough. A national awareness campaign is the primary prevention opportunity to deliver clear information to the Australian community to effect changes in behaviour and attitude. It is the first step which needs to be supported by labelling and signage in all liquor outlets and curriculum education and skills. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (13<span class="HPS-Time">:03</span>):  The ABC religious program <span style="font-style:italic;">Compass</span> recently gave the wider Australian electorate perhaps their first knowledge of the Mandeans. They are, of course, an ancient religious group from the Middle East, Mesopotamia, although they might have moved there from another place at an earlier time. They are regarded as the last Gnostics, people who essentially see knowledge as their main source of salvation. They put John the Baptist on a higher plane than Islam or Christianity in their pantheon of religious sources. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2003 there were estimated to be 60,000 to 70,000 of them essentially in Iraq and to some degree Iran. In the words of Nathaniel Deutsch in the 7 October 2007 <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> article:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The United States did not set out to eradicate the Mandeans, one of the smallest, oldest and least understood of the many minorities in Iraq. This extinction in the making has simply been another unfortunate and entirely unintended consequence of the invasion of Iraq.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not for a moment saying that justification of Iraq intervention is either for or against it premised on that, but it is one of the outcomes. Although they were subject to persecution from time immemorial there is no doubt that the increased religious enmities within Iraq and the association perhaps of them as being more Western than other religious groups has led to particular problems for them, to the point where they face extinction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting that as of today, in contrast to that figure of 2003, there is regarded as being barely 7,000 of them still in Iraq and perhaps 5,000 to 10,000 in Iran. As with many minorities in Iran, you would not be certain of the figures because of the hostility of the religiously based theocratic regime to all minorities. Importantly, in the Western world, Australia is now regarded, after Sweden, as being their main homeland. It is estimated that 3,500 currently reside here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth stressing a point that I have perceived of them in dealing with them that came out of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Compass</span> program. I will go back and say that my first dealings were going to exhibitions at Liverpool Museum of their silverwork, goldwork and also, as with the speaker after me, in being associated with them in regards to refugee cases. What came out of that <span style="font-style:italic;">Compass</span> program is a really strong emphasis which we see with all diasporas in this country but I think is particularly strong with them, and that is the way in which they themselves put it in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Compass</span> program. Whilst they very much wish to retain a very ancient religion and the particularities of it, they have a very strong sentiment of integration. Having been to their New Year events, it is quite amazing. Unless you listen to the music and the singing, you could very clearly be at a very Anglo-Australian festivity. Also, the way in which their children incorporate themselves in the government school system and very much the way in which large parts of the community strongly intimate the need for integration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An unidentified refugee in an article in the Swedish publication <span style="font-style:italic;">Religion and Ethics News </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Weekly</span> stated: </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We would like to propagate our faith to the children, but we live here and would also like to integrate into society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is very much the slant of this group. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This resolution aims firstly, to emphasise the continuing particular crisis they face in Iraq. As I have said, it is fairly pronounced. One of the aspects that is very important is that they cannot relocate. Indisputably, every minority in Iraq faces grave difficulties, but in regards to the Mandeans their very small numbers make relocation internally extremely difficult, and at the same time their language, a form of Aramaic, and their beliefs are singular. If we are talking about diversity in the world, if we are talking about preserving historical aspects that matter to us, they have an enhanced case on those fronts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are subject to kidnapping, straight-out religious intolerance and murders. They are subject to kidnappings because of the perception of their income levels. They religiously are obliged not to carry weapons. They are pacifists, so there is no possibility of self-defence and so on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point in regard to migration and refugee policy in this country is that if we have an intake that is totally driven by boats, planes and rather opinionated lawyers, it does not give the government of the day the possibility of making sure that this country does, indeed, protect very vulnerable minorities. You cannot basically have boats deciding what the intake will be. They will all come at one time from Afghanistan or at another time Sri Lanka and still have a policy which preserves the diversity of the intake and gives the government of the day, Labor or Liberal, the possibility of fashioning an intake around who is regarded by the United Nations as being particularly vulnerable. That is another reason that I am raising this resolution. Obviously there have been times when some Mandeans have entered by boat as well. There is no disputing that. But predominantly they have entered in the refugee humanitarian intake. I constantly have cases involving their community. Very few weeks go by without people coming to my office and to a lesser extent that of the member for Fowler, because their predominant location in Sydney is the Liverpool municipal area. Dr Mtashar and other groups are based there. They have had very strong historical support from the Liverpool Multicultural Centre, which has allowed them to develop an organisation, community building and so on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to quote an article by Murthard Ababistani in a University of Malaya paper. It states:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Mandeans have been living in Iraq and Iran for over two millennia. During these centuries they have been a small ethnic group surrounded by the non-Mandean people and under the threat of identity elimination. This situation inevitably made their group identity protection one of their main concerns.</span>

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  "> were unified and inseparable. The constant threat of ethnocide and the priority of identity protection had confined the Mandeans within their petrified religious rituals as the main reference of their identity. Living in secular and multicultural society a secularisation trend in the sense of separation among the Mandean community of Australia is observable. The Mandeans follow their social interest such as group identity and integrity through their secular association and organisations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that writer said is clearly happening in this country at the moment. It came out in that <span style="font-style:italic;">Compass</span> program and it has been evidenced in my dealings with the community. They are very much now about incorporating into this society, being involved in community organisations beyond their own community. Also Australia has in a sense affected to some degree religious practices. It was very interesting in that program to see the way in which the requirement that they baptise, which is central to their beliefs, is now being carried out for the first time in areas other than rivers. This is causing some angst in the community, but it is seen as a practical reaction of young people not being very attracted to what they regard as polluted rivers being the source.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to have the opportunity here today to put forward the argument that this country should be vigilant about continued abuses to this minority in Iraq and other minorities as well, that our foreign affairs department should make sure it takes up these issues, that this should inform government policy in regards to the refugee humanitarian intake, that we should be mindful that here today—not yesterday, not last week, not six years ago—we see evidence of persecutions of minorities, and that when we do have consideration of what countries or groups do get priority that they remain important in the forefront of consideration by Australia.</span>

I note that he referred to his predecessor, who has also taken an interest in the question of the Sabean Mandeans. I was interested in his reference to a television program, Compass. I must say that my knowledge of the Sabean Mandeans goes a little earlier than the ABC's recent revelations. </span></span>

I have spoken in debates on matters involving religious minorities in Iraq raised by the member for Fowler, Mr Hayes. I did that on 30 May.

                  <span class="HPS-Time">I think it is important to understand their very unique position in the world. It is a fact that they have been identified as the only surviving group representing the ancient Mediterranean movement known as Gnosticism, discovered by Western scholars in the 17th century, and the community survives in Iraq and Iran. The numbers in Iraq referred to and identified in the US State Department documentation dealing with religious minorities in Iraq estimates the size of the Sabean Mandean community varies, but 3,000 to 7,000 are now estimated to remain in-country, reduced from something of the order of 50,000 to 60,000 that were there in 2003. Of course, the UNHCR has also paid some regard, noting that in the refugee cases of Iraqis living outside of the country something of the order of three per cent were Sabean Mandeans. A similar report in relation to Iran reveals the numbers of people estimated to be Sabean Mandean is 5,000 to 10,000 persons residing in Kundistan, south-west of Iran.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">Of course these people are descendants of those who are seen to have been the remaining followers of John the Baptist. But it has been noted that the origin is somewhat obscure. They appear to have originated in Palestine as a sect in the first century BC and they apparently absorbed material including the practice of baptism that had been begun by John the Baptist and early Christians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">It is a significant and unique community and one that I have been focused on from my earlier days as a minister for immigration and multicultural affairs. I was responsible in part for ensuring that within our programs for resettlement from the Middle East places were found for Sabean Mandeans. I have come to know a number of them, not as constituents, but the most interesting one is one that I find established a silver business in Liverpool, probably in the electorate of the member, nearby. He was quite an interesting man. You will now find him in the Gold Souk, Dubai as well. He has established premises there under the name Aussie Mike's and has been able to identify a unique niche linking his profession with the needs of the people who travel in that part of the world. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">I did want in this debate to endorse the comments made by the member who spoke. In previous debates I have said that I am not desirous of seeing an evacuation of all of the Christians from the Middle East, even though many of them are under enormous pressure. That is of interest in relation to the Copts in Egypt that are now under significant pressure again. It is of interest particularly to the Syrian populations and the Chaldeans in Iraq, but it is also of interest to many of the orthodox followers in that region. I must say the Middle East Council of Christian Organisations has made the point that there needs to be a continuing presence of Christians in the Middle East. I do not know that the same can be said in relation to the Sabean Mandeans. I think it is part of the area in which they have obviously been brought up, but I think the size of the groups is such that they are enormously vulnerable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">There is a paper that is a little dated, November 2009, prepared by the Mandean Human Rights Group; it was their annual report. It is quite an interesting document because it outlines something of the demography and the history of the Mandeans. Honourable members who want to interest themselves in the matter might care to obtain a copy. I am happy to table this document when I have ceased referring to it, but it does go on to make the point that there is for the Sabean Mandeans the threat of extinction. When you take into account the very small number of Mandeans dispersed over a large number of countries as refugees, unless they have policies like we do that respect diversity and encourage people to maintain something of their history and their culture, in many other parts of the world they may find it difficult to survive. I am not saying that even where you have a tolerant society like we do that they may not be under a very significant threat even here in Australia.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">What I found particularly challenging in reading the document was something of the plight that the community continues to suffer because they do outline in this particular report something of the experience that the Mandeans are facing in Iraq and Iran in particular. What you have in this document is the list of names of Mandeans murdered in 2003 and 2004. Looking at the documents, there were 18 in 2003, 34 in 2004 and 64 in 2005. When you continue through the documents you find that by the time we reach something of the order of 2009 there are named in total 163 people who have been murdered.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">Similarly, the report includes lists of those people who have been kidnapped. Equally the numbers are of very considerable and real concern. There are the documented names of 271 Mandeans that had been subjected to kidnapping. Then you move to those who are threatened and assaulted and what you find is that there are recorded something of the order of 238 names of people who have been the subject of threats and assaults. With rape there are the names of 11 Mandeans. Of those who have been forced to conversion it is something of the order of 33. Those who have faced forceful displacement—and again the numbers are quite significant—and other forms of incidents have also been identified. What I think is significant is the relatively large numbers of people who have suffered in those ways in a population which is little more than several thousand people.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">It gives you some idea of the enormity of the risks that they face and the threats that they are under. I think Australia does need to continue to keep the Mandeans very much in mind in the Refugee Resettlement Program. These are people who can be brought to Australia through the front door.</span>

As of the 2006 census there were 12,300 Burma-born people living in Australia. There would be many more than that now. The Burmese community in Australia is a vibrant one that adds value to the communities in which they reside. The 2006 census also indicates that 78 per cent speak English very well, which undoubtedly has made it a little easier for them to quickly settle into their communities. Many Burmese immigrants brought with them clerical skills with work experience in the Burmese Public Service and easily found employment in Australia.</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">At the 2006 census 53.9 per cent of the Burma-born aged 15 years and over had some form of higher non-school qualifications compared to just lower than that, 52.5 per cent, of the Australian population. Also, among Burma-born people aged 15 years and over the participation rate in the labour force was nearly 60 per cent and the unemployment rate was 5.3 per cent, comparable to the rest of the Australian population. At the 2006 census the estimated rate of Australian citizenship was 91.6 per cent, compared to 75 per cent for all overseas-born immigrants. That is a truly remarkable figure which is a testament to the incredible level of integration this community has undergone in such a short period of time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">I have a very strong Burmese community in my electorate. Like the Burmese communities spread around Australia they are vibrant, energetic and add value to the social fabric of my electorate. I have attended numerous functions and events held by the community but I would like to make special note of the Burmese Medical Association who have worked tirelessly to further the Burmese cause in Australia, including a fundraising dinner to support those affected by the tragic cyclones which hit Burma in 2008 and 2010.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">Burma is among the poorest countries in South East Asia with almost one-third of its 50 million people living in poverty. Burma's development remains severely constrained by a lack of progress towards real democracy, economic reform and improved service delivery. Ongoing conflict has resulted in refugee populations fleeing to neighbouring countries with estimates of between 500,000 and up to one million people internally displaced. As it stands now, millions of Burmese people are unable to access food, basic healthcare, clean water or education for their children. The situation is particularly bad in eastern Burma where child mortality rates under five are nearly double Burma's national average and women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">The Australian Burmese community are strong advocates for aid and as Australians their contribution to their homeland is significant. Australia recognises the immense development task faced by current and future generations of Burmese. For this reason, Australia's aid to Burma has increased by 65 per cent since 2009-10, from $29.1 million to $47.6 million in 2011-12. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-Time">In 2010 Australia moved the Burma Aid Program from primarily a humanitarian focus to a longer term development plan. The Australian government's investment in the aid program in Burma is achieving results that are improving the lives of ordinary Burmese. For example, in partnership with other donors we have reduced the cost of education for poor families by providing education material such as books, stationery and backpacks to 918,000 children in 2,440 primary schools. We have helped 2,700 marginalised ethnic families each access one acre of land through the establishment of community forestry plots in remote areas of northern Rakhine state. Families have increased their income through harvesting their land. Our support to the multi-donor Three Diseases Fund has seen malaria treatment provided to more than 1.48 million people and antiretroviral therapy to nearly 16,000 people living with HIV. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">On the Thai-Burma border Australian support to refugees living in camps has led to the number of women in key leadership roles increasing from 11 per cent in 2006 to 32 per cent in 2010. Programs we fund that directly deal with refugees include $1.6 million to provide basic relief for over 140,000 Burmese living in refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border, $1.5 million to provide free primary healthcare to refugees, migrant workers and other vulnerable people who cross the border from Burma to Thailand, and $1.5 million to support vocational training programs for refugees in three camps on the Thai-Burma border to broaden opportunities for future employment. Burma is one of the few countries where the current generation of schoolchildren is likely to be less educated than their parents and grandparents. Australia's support for the education sector has helped increase the proportion of primary school students who have stayed up to grade five in target schools. This has increased from 62 per cent in 2007 to 76 per cent in 2010. </span>

Australia has always considered the Burmese people our friends and our two countries are woven together by the people that we share. When Cyclone Nagas struck, Australia responded generously despite our political differences with the Burmese authorities. That was the right decision then and it is the right decision now to work together with the international community to do more for the long-term future of Burmese people. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  I rise to speak on the Legislative Instruments Amendment (Sunsetting) Bill 2011, although I do so relatively briefly because it is one of the administrative bills that we often deal with in this House that has the support of both sides of the parliament. I do not think it requires me to give an enormously long speech. The coalition support this bill in principle, although we note that it is still before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. It is right that the parliament wait to see the results of its report before we finally pass this bill through both houses of parliament. The intention of the proposed amendment seems rational in that legislative instruments will sunset 10 years from the time of their legal commencement. The effect of the current wording of section 50 of the principal act is that instruments with a retrospective commencement date can sunset before that time or can, in some cases, sunset before they are made because they need to operate longer than 10 years into the past. Routine review of legislation will act as a way to ensure that it remains current, clear and relevant. It is important that the status of legislative instruments is easily ascertainable. However, the number of retrospective instruments is not stated in the proposed amendment and there may be a number of instruments which will have their lives significantly extended by this amendment. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I agree that the Legislative Instruments Amendment (Sunsetting) Bill 2011 is a non-controversial piece of legislation. I can, at least, update members on the progress of the bill through the relevant committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, of which I am a member. Such is the non-controversial nature of this bill that, when it was referred to the committee for examination, no submissions were received on the bill and the committee determined it unnecessary to hold public hearings. The recommendation of the committee was that this bill be passed without amendment and the resolutions of the committee in that regard were unanimous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this bill is non-controversial, it deals with a fundamental piece of statutory interpretation and rule-making law, the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. When one considers the nature and frequency by which legislative instruments are utilised in our modern system of parliamentary law making, the need to maintain a robust, unambiguous governing statute becomes clear. Indeed, the very definition of what constitutes a legislative instrument, as defined in section 5 of the act itself, is fundamental. Subject to the operation of a number of other subsections a legislative instrument is defined as an instrument in writing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) that is of a legislative character; and </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) that is or was made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And an instrument is taken to be of a legislative character if: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) it determines the law or alters the content of the law, rather than applying the law in a particular case; and </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) it has the direct or indirect effect of affecting a privilege or interest, imposing an obligation, creating a right, or varying or removing an obligation or right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The operation of this definition in practice, however, is not necessarily straightforward. Case law has explored the test of whether something is judicial or administrative in nature. One of the key consequences of this distinction is that the answer determines the relevant appealable avenues, primarily through either administrative appeal or the disallowance process. </span>

                    </a>  The sunsetting regime ensures that legislative instruments are reviewed regularly and kept up to date. The bill makes minor yet important changes to the sunsetting rules as they apply to instruments which commence with retrospective effect. This change will ensure that these instruments have 10 years of operation from the date they are registered on the federal register of legislative instruments before they sunset. Under the current provisions, these instruments can often sunset much earlier than anticipated by the Legislative Instruments Act. The practical effect of this change will be that the calculation of the sunsetting date for legislative instruments which commence retrospectively will begin from their date of registration on the federal register rather than on the day of commencement. Similarly, where some but not all provisions of a legislative instrument commence retrospectively, the sunsetting date for those retrospectively commencing provisions will be calculated from the day of registration rather than commencement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed by the bill do not affect the act's rules about the limited circumstances in which instruments with retrospective operations may be made. As can be seen, these amendments to the Legislative Instruments Act work to make the act much easier to use and increase consistency throughout its operation. So this bill does some very important things through its minor amendments to the Legislative Instruments Act to provide that instruments with retrospective commencement remain in force for 10 years following their registration. I thank the Attorney-General for his work in this area and encourage all members to support this bill. It will give certainty and consistency to the very important advisory role when establishing legislative instruments and their currency.</span>

The Legislative Instruments Act (Sunsetting) Bill <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">2011</span> is an important bill. It provides for the accountability mechanisms that apply in the making of legislative instruments as well as ensuring that all subordinate legislation is able to be accessed through an online register, the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. The bill also provides for the eventual sunsetting—that is, automatic ceasing of the legislative instruments. Sunsetting ensures that there is a review of the continuing need for legislative instruments after 10 years of operation. This bill makes a minor and important change to the rules as they apply to instruments which commenced with retrospective effect. The effect of this change will be to allow such instruments to operate for a full 10 years before they sunset. This is consistent with the intended operation of the sunsetting provisions of the bill.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TONY SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I would like to contribute to statements on this matter moved by the Prime Minister last week on Vietnam Veterans Day. In doing so, I mention the wonderful service held in the electorate of Casey on Sunday prior to Vietnam Veterans Day, Sunday, 14 August. It was a service organised and hosted by the Yarra Valley Vietnam Veterans Day Combined Service Committee. It is an initiative of the Vietnam veterans community, the Outer Eastern Sub-Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association, many of the local RSLs within the Yarra Valley in outer eastern Melbourne, including Healesville, Lilydale, Upper Yarra, Warburton and Yarra Glen, and the National Serviceman's Association. I know the Croydon RSL were also represented at the service, which was held in the Lilydale main street on Sunday morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the members of those RSLs who were there. I want to pay tribute to those Vietnam veterans from each of those RSLs and from surrounding areas who came to that service. The service was larger than in previous years. I make mention of that because I think it is the hope of all of us in this House that the importance of this day continues to grow. Vietnam Veterans Day is a time to reflect on so many matters associated with that long conflict. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken on a number of occasions before in the House about some of those issues. I particularly reflect, as many members would, on the issues surrounding the Battle of Long Tan and the failure to award medals and appropriate citations after that battle. I do so having known one of the great heroes of the Battle of Long Tan, Cliff Dohle, now deceased, who was a helicopter pilot in that battle. I know the parliamentary secretary at the table is very familiar with the details of the battle and with the story of Cliff Dohle, who passed away a short while back. He performed a pivotal role on the day. Cliff and his wife retired to the Yarra Valley. Getting to know Cliff by meeting him in my electorate office and hearing those stories firsthand is something I have spoken about before. It is only natural that on each Vietnam Veterans Day I think of Cliff and reflect on the Battle of Long Tan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also a time to candidly reflect on how we as a nation treated returning Vietnam servicemen. Former Prime Minister John Howard told the parliament back in 2006 that the entire Australian community failed the servicemen when they returned from Vietnam. All of us know that that is right; that some of those servicemen returning from Vietnam were treated disgracefully and appallingly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we celebrate Vietnam Veterans Day, it is a time to remember their contribution and those who lost their lives, and to think of those men who are now taking leadership roles in our RSLs. It is a time to reflect on the past, but equally a time to look to the future. I know that both sides of the House will agree that they are performing leadership roles at so many levels within local RSLs as, with the effluxion of time, we wave goodbye to so many of the World War II and Korean War generation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some progress has been made on the issue of the Long Tan medals; I would really like to acknowledge that to the House. It was a difficult issue to try to address many years after that conflict. On Vietnam Veterans Day, we remember all those who served in the Vietnam War and the more than 500 who lost their lives in that conflict. We say thanks as a nation for their contribution. We say 'well done' for the contribution that many continue to make in leadership roles within local RSL clubs.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  It is a great honour to speak in this debate. I thank the member for Casey for his fine remarks and his recognition and acknowledgement of the importance of Long Tan Day, and more generally the importance of recognising the contribution of our Vietnam veterans to the Australian nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is hard for us to understand that over a decade 60,000 Australian men served in Vietnam and of those, sadly, 521 were killed in action or died as a result of their wounds, and over 3,000 were wounded. It is very difficult for those of us who sit in a place like this and who have never worn an Australian uniform—whether it is Air Force, Army or Navy—to understand or appreciate what that actually means. Yes, the war in Vietnam was an unpopular war and, yes, almost half of the Australian men serving there were national servicemen, many of whom did not elect to go. But they went and they went to carry out government policy. This was a choice of government and government, as we know, is the voice of the people. Although we might not understand or even be able to imagine the horror of this conflict, our forebears in this place bear the responsibility for having sent these men to war, so we wear that responsibility. We have to understand and appreciate what actually happened and the depth of sorrow and anguish that results from decisions to send people to war and to see and to know what the long-term implications are of an effort such as this where we lose 521 brave men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Thursday I attended the national Vietnam veterans commemorative service held here at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Anzac Parade at which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were both present. The Prime Minister gave what I thought was a very fine speech. It was a cold wintery morning, very unlike anything that would have been experienced in Vietnam, but many came to pay their respects to the fallen and remember and pay tribute to the service of so many of our fellow Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, it was 45 years ago to the day that soldiers of Delta Company 6RAR held fast against a large enemy force in the battle of Long Tan. This battle on 18 August was one of the most significant engagements by the Australian forces during the war. There were others. But the importance of this bloody engagement cannot be underestimated—108 Australian and New Zealand soldiers fought a pitched battle against an estimated 2,000 determined North Vietnamese and Vietcong enemy at a rubber plantation near Long Tan. On this terrible day 18 Australians were killed, the most killed in any one engagement of the war in Vietnam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To recognise their extraordinary gallantry in action, veterans of Delta Company were presented with the unit citation of gallantry by the Governor-General, Her Excellency Mrs Quentin Bryce. The special parade was at Gallipoli Barracks Enoggera in Brisbane on Thursday afternoon. I was honoured and privileged to be in attendance. The veterans there were hosted by the current 6RAR who themselves have only just recently returned from Afghanistan as Mentoring Task Force 1, MTF1. MTF1 was also presented with meritorious unit citation for outstanding service in warlike operations on Operation Slipper in Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan between 20 January and 30 October 2010. It was indeed a proud and very special moment for all involved to see the younger veterans and our Vietnam veterans together on parade and receiving recognition together for their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian service in Vietnam spanned over 10 years and we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of Australian service personnel during that entire period. These battles in Vietnam were difficult battles. They were close pitched and intense, fought in difficult conditions. Our service personnel fought in the Anzac spirit, with great courage, conviction and valour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worthwhile pointing out that a number of years ago we still had four MIAs in Vietnam. We have discovered where those MIAs have been. We have recovered their remains and we have brought them home. So their final resting place is in the holy soil of Australia, their home. Sadly though, as we well know, in times past as a nation we have not recognised the service of our veterans from this war as we should have. Vietnam Veterans Day provides the nation with an opportunity to pause and reflect, to remember the service of our Vietnam veterans and pay tribute to those gone before, and to learn from our past so that we may better look after our ADF personnel of today and the future. This is not the time to talk about what we need to do for our current serving personnel but we need to do more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a child of this generation when the war was deeply unpopular here at home. I knew people who were conscientious objectors. I knew people who were national servicemen who went to war. I knew people who were injured by that war, either mentally or physically. Sadly, as they get older, sometimes their difficulties increase. We have yet to come to terms and really understand the depth of hurt which many of these men carry with them today and appreciate what that means for us. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and I am sure as with previous ministers for veterans' affairs, I speak on behalf of the nation when I say to these veterans that, despite your experiences of the past, we are absolutely committed to providing the best we possibly can for your welfare and for your health and that of your families as you get older.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in this country we are living longer and for the many people with challenges that remain, with demons which they cannot expunge, we will work with them to help them get on top of them—and we will. We will continue to do what others have done before. But the message here is very clear to us: as I said at the outset, we in this place bear a special responsibility. It is governments that send people to war. We wear a special responsibility towards our past veterans and today's veterans. We cannot do as was done in the past and ignore their pleas and ignore their needs. We need to accommodate them and work with them to satisfy them. I am committed to doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This day last week was a special day for Australian veterans who served in that war, and for their families. For so many, the families are the ones who bore the burden of the hurt and many still do. We have a special obligation to defence force men and women and their families. Whatever their service, we need to continue to diligently apply ourselves to making sure that they get the very best we can offer.</span>

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  With parliament sitting last week, regrettably many of us were unable to attend services in our own electorates. Nonetheless, it should be recorded in this place that, particularly in an electorate like Dickson, we have a vibrant veterans community and they are people who stand very proud for their service, for the loss and sacrifice that they and many of their friends have endured over the course of their service. We salute their service, not just here but right around the country at those ceremonies last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 18th of August this year marked the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. With all such anniversaries there has to be a lot of reflection but even more so on this 45th anniversary of the gallantry of those who fought in the historic Battle of Long Tan in the Vietnam War. It was a battle which was recognised by the presentation of the Australian Unit Citation for Gallantry by the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, to the survivors of D Company 6 RAR at Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, Brisbane, home of the 6th Battalion of the RAR. I understand that was a very moving ceremony. All of us have over the years heard different stories from veterans in our community about their recollections passed down to them, about the Battle of Long Tan. The youngest Australian to die in that battle was just 19 and the oldest was only 22 and, as I understand, from listening to somebody recently, over half of those killed were Queensland national servicemen. They are men whose bravery will never be forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Anzac Avenue in my electorate, at the aptly named Nui Dat bus stop, there is Vietnam Veterans Place, a quiet oasis of reflection on a busy thoroughfare. This memorial was conceived and created by Vietnam veterans in conjunction with the Pine Rivers Shire Council, local businesses and local tradesmen. It includes a flag station, gardens and a brick walkway that includes bricks stamped with the titles of every Australian unit to serve in Vietnam and is a suitable place to contemplate and remember the sacrifices of those who served in Vietnam who are no longer with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 17 branches of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia in Queensland, and one of those, the Brisbane North division, has its headquarters at Black Duck Cottage, at Kallangur in my electorate. With the number of very active RSL sub-branches in Dickson—namely Bray Park-Strathpine,<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>Samford,<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>Dayboro and Pine Rivers district—it is not surprising to note that the Vietnam Veterans Association, which draws from all arms of Defence, has a membership growing from strength to strength, year to year, and has a current membership of 168, all there to uphold their motto, 'Honour the dead but fight like hell for the living'. This Brisbane North branch of the VVAA was formed in around 1982, one of the earliest sub-branches after the Vietnam Veterans Action Group was formed in NSW in 1978. The Brisbane North executive: Peter Thorn, president; Len Halford, senior vice-president; John Barrett, junior vice-president; and Peter Farrelly, treasurer and secretary are to be commended for their work in looking after the welfare of veterans and their families, with the assistance of committee members Gus Fraser, Jim Shaw, Gordon Johnson, Raymond Royston and Fred Ellingworth, among many others. Needless to say, there is also of course a social committee made up of those mentioned above. The dedication of those who are part of the association is enduring, as can be seen in the case of John Smith OAM, who joined the Brisbane North branch in August 1992 and has served as the sub-branch president and vice-president, state president and vice-president and who is now the national vice-president and state delegate to national council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all people of considerable talent and they have all in their own ways made considerable sacrifices. Not only have they made a sacrifice; their families have of course made significant sacrifices as well. At the memorial service at Black Duck Cottage last Thursday morning, Mr Farrelly was the guest speaker. I was given a copy of his speech. I found it quite moving and I want to contribute a little of his speech as part of this debate today. I want to quote him to allow the House to gain an understanding of the quality of the speech that he presented and also the message that he wanted to deliver. The speech reads as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australian military troops served in the Vietnam War from 1962 through to 1975. It was the longest conflict that Australian servicemen and women fought and served in during our military's short history. It is without doubt also one of the most controversial of wars that any country served, and divided a nation that led to riots and divisions that remain today. It has left a lasting legacy that will take several generations to finally put this part of Australia's history to rest, and during this time it continues to provoke arguments that rekindle and revise the merits of this conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">During this period 521 Australian servicemen were killed in Vietnam. In excess of 3,000 servicemen were wounded, whilst some 60,000 military personnel served. Many of these doing two and sometimes three tours of duty. To be able to put troops into the country and to keep our numbers up to the required quota, National Service was made compulsory for young Australians. Any male aged between 17 to 21 and born during a certain month were balloted. National Service evoked controversy from all sides of politics and civilian life and ultimately led to some of the most violent clashes between rioters and police this country has ever seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has since recovered all of its war KIA's in operations that defy the massive procedures undertaken to achieve this remarkable feat. Using old memories, maps, co-ordinates given during battle and the ever changing landscape a few dedicated Australian people have painstakingly traced and tracked our war dead and ceremonially returned their remains to their Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These people continue their work in Vietnam but now assist in the search for the remains of South Vietnamese and North Vietnamese servicemen who died and were buried in the field. At the war's height more than 500,000 American servicemen were in country, where their losses exceeded 60,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter's speech goes on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As Australian troops began the main withdrawal in September 1971, those who had returned home earlier found themselves ostracised by friends, the RSL, and even the military which had sent them there in the first place. There was no support from the military; the RSL did not want to know us, and in some instances families did not welcome them home. Increasingly ex-serving soldiers became loners, and sought refuge with other like-minded veterans where they could relate to each other without fear or condemnation. From this the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia was formed which united the veterans and unified them into a cohesive and powerful veteran voice. They remain the choice of many service organisations today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The speech went on for a little bit beyond that in most eloquent words and closed in this way:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Today is Vietnam Veterans Day and the 45th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan. A day when Australians remember all those servicemen and servicewomen who served, suffered and died. A day to reflect and commemorate not only fellow Australians but our American and New Zealand comrades in arms and a time to reflect on the misery of the South Vietnamese people that this war ultimately inflicted. To those servicemen and servicewomen who perished in South Vietnam and to those veterans who have since passed, rest in peace my friends. We do remember you all. Lest we forget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are powerful words; they are words that speak very strongly for a generation of families who were disproportionately affected by what was a terrible war. It is not a pretty picture of our history, and the way in which people were ultimately treated for their presence in Vietnam, both at the time of their engagement and on return from their engagement, shone an even poorer light on the behaviour of some in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my opening remarks, we have a very strong local veterans community. Over the course of the last 10 years I have made it my business to befriend and support wherever I can many of the veterans in our local community. I know that in the area of Kallangur, which is on the border of the electorate of Longman, Wyatt Roy has embarked on a similar process. We want to continue to help and assist those veterans and those families who still suffer many of those wounds, particularly mentally, today. We want to make sure that we continue to provide support wherever possible to those families and to the generations that follow, 'where the pain is still felt most surely,' as Peter mentioned in his speech. I close with the mission statement of the Vietnam Veterans Association, which is: 'To assist all veterans, dependants and their descendants in all matters relating to their health, welfare and wellbeing'. We can all be proud of their ongoing service. To the veterans in the Dickson community, I say thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Trade</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Prime Minister's statement on Vietnam Veterans Day. Last Thursday, 18 August, our nation recognised and honoured the veterans of the Vietnam War. Really, Vietnam Veterans Day is a day for all Australians to pay tribute to those who served in the Vietnam War. The day is commemorated each year on the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, one of the most significant Australian actions of the Vietnam War. This year marked the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. This battle occurred on 18 August 1966 and during this battle 18 Australians were killed—the most killed in any one engagement of the Vietnam War—and 24 were wounded. In the years since it was fought, many people have said the battle has achieved a symbolic significance for the Australian military in the Vietnam War which is similar to that of other battles Australians remember, such as the Gallipoli campaign, the Kokoda Track and the Battle of Kapyong. Indeed, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War remains the longest in duration of any war in Australia's history. It lasted from August 1962 until May 1975. Although the Australian commitment was predominantly Army personnel, there were also significant numbers of civilians as well as Air Force and Navy personnel. According to the Nominal Roll of Vietnam Veterans, almost 60,000 Australians served in Vietnam and 521 Australians died as a result of the war, with over 3,000 wounded. Of the 521 Australian who died in the war, 496 were Australian Army personnel, 17 were RAAF personnel and eight were RAN personnel. The involvement of Australian forces in Vietnam was a gradual escalation, taking place over many years, and our forces battled against extremes of terrain and climate, through dense jungle and monsoonal conditions. They faced a very well-organised force. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must never forget the service and sacrifice of those very brave Australians; they fought with such great courage and valour in the face of adversity. As many speakers have commented on today, when those Australian troops came home from Vietnam they returned to a nation that was really divided in its view of the war and, mostly, they were not welcomed home by a grateful nation in the same way as troops returning home from World War I or World War II were welcomed before them. For many of the surviving Vietnam veterans, time has not always healed the physical and psychological scars that resulted from their service, and often their families share this physical and emotional burden. It is important to acknowledge that the aftermath of war has been difficult to deal with, and we should recognise the contribution that veterans' families also have made. That is just as vitally important. In acknowledging the very difficult time that many of our veterans had when they came home, it is important to realise, too, that the veterans of the Vietnam War did not receive an official welcome home parade until 1987. That was a significant period of time later and was an issue, understandably, for many of those veterans. It is for this reason, and of course for so many other reasons, that on 18 August each year Australia as a nation recognises, remembers and honours the veterans of the Vietnam War. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Richmond has one of the largest numbers of veterans throughout the nation. It has been my honour to meet and work with many of them over the years and to see their great commitment in so many ways. I note that many of them are veterans of the Vietnam War. As other speakers have mentioned, with parliament sitting last week, many of us were not able to attend local events. One of my staff members, Jodie Bellchambers, attended the event of a Vietnam veterans group in my electorate and she laid a wreath on behalf of the Commonwealth. Peter Crockett, a veteran, a lovely man whom we all refer to as 'Davy' Crockett, has organised this event for many years. It is held at South Tweed Sports club, which has supported the veterans group. The club has a lovely memorial garden, and the service is held there every year. I certainly would like to commend Davy for organising this very important event. I know there are many events locally and throughout the nation. It is important that we continue to have those events so that we can take the time to remember the service and sacrifice of all Vietnam veterans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to note that the Governor-General marked the day last week on behalf of the nation with the presentation of a unit citation to Delta Company, 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, at Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera in Queensland. The unit citation recognises acts of extraordinary gallantry in action by Delta Company during the Battle of Long Tan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding today, I would like to quote from Paul Keating's speech at the funeral service of the Unknown Australian Soldier on 11 November, 1993. The Unknown Australian Soldier was a casualty of the First World War, but I believe the sentiments translate to all our veterans from all wars, who have made such sacrifices in the defence of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For out of the war came a lesson which transcended the horror and tragedy and the inexcusable folly. It was a lesson about ordinary people – and the lesson was that they were not ordinary. On all sides they were the heroes of that war; not the generals and the politicians but the soldiers and sailors and nurses – those who taught us to endure hardship, to show courage, to be bold as well as resilient, to believe in ourselves, to stick together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Unknown Australian Soldier whom we are interring today was one of those who, by his deeds, proved that real nobility and grandeur belongs, not to empires and nations, but to the people on whom they, in the last resort, always depend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <a href="M3A" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  It is a privilege to rise and contribute to the debate. I want to endorse the comments made by my colleagues who have spoken before me. I want to acknowledge Vietnam Veterans Day. The Vietnam War has relevance in terms of my own life experiences as I am of that vintage. As young men and women, we grew up at a time when Australia was committing to the Vietnam War and to the conflict there. We know of some of the events that occurred over a period of time but the footage we saw on television for the first time covered the conflict from its beginning to its end. From those images, we had a sense of some of the challenges that Australian service men and women were experiencing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 60,000 Australians served in the Vietnam conflict. Sadly, 521 paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country and its interests. Some 47,000 Vietnam veterans are alive today and it is for them, their fallen comrades and the families affected that we remember them specifically every year. There are many Vietnam veterans in Hasluck. I often believe that, as members of parliament, we have an incredible privilege in meeting, working and talking with the service men and women who served in many fronts and in many campaigns on behalf of this country. Service men and women when called do not ask; they serve. I have had the privilege and honour to meet with some of these men in my first year in office. The pride with which they acknowledge their service, the regret they express at the loss of life and the frustration of their treatment on returning home from Vietnam makes me truly humble. The pictorial representations that were so strong in those days have etched in my memory the way we treated some of our servicemen returning home from that conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vietnam Veterans Day is an important occasion but one made even more poignant this year on the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. In 1966, 18 young Australians died and 24 were wounded in what would become the stuff of legend. I remember the headlines in the local papers that were common in Perth at that time. I particularly remember a cartoon—and I am sure it was drawn by Paul Rigby—that showed Aussie diggers surrounded, at the end of a campaign just leaning there quietly reflecting on the fact that some comrades had fallen but also looking at the insurmountable numbers that had charged during that campaign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keen to inflict a politically unacceptable number of casualties on the Australian forces, the North Vietnamese Army and the Vietcong planned an ambush of the Australian troops in the rubber plantation area of Long Tan. I will not repeat the details of this well-known battle here today, but the men of D Company, 6th Royal Australian Regiment, the first APC squadron and a section of the New Zealand artillery defeated a numerically superior force, numbering in the thousands. In the pursuing battle, over 24 hours, the Australian courage and fighting spirit was shown to the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of these men were not regular soldiers. Many of us of a certain age will remember the controversy surrounding conscription and the drafting of Australia's young men into the armed forces. At Long Tan, conscripts faced off against some of North Vietnam's toughest soldiers and they held themselves and their country in high regard. As a result, a long overdue Unit Citation for Gallantry was awarded last week to D Company of the 6RAR. I honour their courage and am pleased that this nation finally recognises the true sacrifice our armed forces made in this decade-long conflict, which shaped the sixties and the seventies. I have friends who served in the Vietnam War and each one has a different story to tell of their service. Some received devastating physical wounds, but all of them were wounded emotionally and mentally in some capacity. It has taken Australian society a long time to understand and acknowledge issues such as post traumatic stress disorder and the impact they have on returning soldiers and their families. I would like to think that we have learnt from these lessons and are prepared for our troops returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan. But more needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I held a recent forum with the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Michael Ronaldson. Veterans from the conflicts of World War II, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Iraq and Afghanistan came together to talk about their issues. The recurring theme was one of helplessness that our Vietnam veterans felt on return, especially for those who were physically incapacitated as a result of their service, and the impact that that has had on the quality of life. It was very interesting listening to the stories that they shared with us of both their pride of having served their country and the frustration they have for what they termed a 'continuing war', whilst retaining recognition for the rights and entitlements that they were seeking for both the physical, emotional and mental impact that that war had. Certainly, their shared stories brought back to me memories of three people in particular: Peter Keilor, who comes from the town of Corrigin; and two brothers, Peter and David Stone, who are twins, who also served in Vietnam. All three, as I remember them, went away as strong young men. They returned, but Peter lost his limbs, having stood on a mine. David and Peter shared some of their stories but never shared the detail, but certainly indicated their pride in having served.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank Senator Michael Ronaldson and the shadow minister for defence, Senator David Johnston, for making it such an informative day for all those who attended, especially those veterans who were in attendance. I am sure that we are all proud of these men because they, as service men and women, fought to ensure that the freedoms we have and we will always enjoy are endured long into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am equally as proud of the Returned and Services Leagues that call Hasluck home. The Gosnells RSL is a very vibrant group of returned servicemen. The Bellevue RSL and the Kalamunda RSL all represent their members well. I enjoy the camaraderie of the discussions that I have with them on issues that they raise. Issues about ex-Vietnamese servicemen now dominate their agenda, and the coalition continues to work hard to shape appropriate policy in this area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I held a Saluting Their Service ceremony in my electoral office. I was fortunate enough to be able to present several Vietnam War veterans with a certificate acknowledging their efforts in this brutal conflict. What was really warming, and it quite touched me and my staff, was not just sitting there, listening to them as veterans swapped their stories, their experiences about the challenges that they still grapple with but being able to contribute to that discussion. They were all men of different ages, from different conflicts, with different experiences but, from their perspective, they were all Australians who served their country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, I want to acknowledge the 60,000 service personnel who served in Vietnam and sacrificed so much in the name of this great country. Our armed forces do not choose where they fight, but they fight when called upon and they must always be honoured and respected. It is the foundation upon which this nation was built. I want to acknowledge their contribution and ask that we never forget what they have given us. Thank you, Deputy Speaker.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  It is an honour to speak on this issue today and it is a day when we recall not just the events of this very significant battle in the Vietnam War but commemorate the entire service of our men and women in the Vietnam War. It is in that spirit that I would like to draw attention to the range of experiences of the people who served in and survived that conflict. Those who came back injured, of course, are often forgotten among the stories of the casualties who did not come back, those who were killed in action. But those who did come back suffered horrendously in relation to the disabilities they acquired. In that conflict so many more survived to live on than in previous conflicts because the battlefield service of our medical services was so good in Vietnam. But they lived with horrendous injuries nevertheless. In fact I was recruited by Brigadier Billy Rolfe, who lost both legs in Vietnam and still went on to make a great deal of his life afterwards. He became a brigadier in the Army, he was a well-known rugby fanatic who coached teams, and he went on and got himself a law degree as well. He was typical of that spirit, the veteran who was not going to be defeated by such horrendous injuries. Quite often in the past those injuries would have led to death in the battlefield, but so many Vietnam veterans did come home to fight that battle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who did not come back to the Army there was a real problem. They went back to a community that, in large degree, either ignored or vilified them. There was either apathy or actual aggression. Both sides of politics let these veterans down. For them it was particularly tough. To endure the things that they had had to endure and to perform their duty in the way they had had to perform it and then not to have support from their community was particularly psychologically devastating. I think we have all learned the lessons of that period. In the case of veterans who now return from conflicts such as Iraq, where there was also controversy, everyone across the spectrum has learned that you do not take out these issues on the veterans. It is the political masters who have to answer for making such decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think those who came back and stayed in the Army had an easier time because they were respected and admired within the Army for their service and for what they had accomplished. The Army that I joined—in terms of the key ingredients, the key bones and sinews and intellect that drove our organisation during my early service—was shaped and driven and influenced by that core of Vietnam veterans that fleshed out the entire organisation. I benefited enormously from the training that I received from those veterans. The training that they provided me helped me survive through the deployments that I went on to serve in, but the whole organisation benefited. The received wisdom that was passed down through the generations that have served since is still there in our Army and it has enabled us to serve well in similarly complex operational environments—these counterinsurgency environments. When we went to Somalia with the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, the very first thing Lieutenant General David Hurley, who is now our Chief of the Defence Force, said was, 'Well, this looks to me like a counterinsurgency type of environment.' And he went on to apply all of those intuitive things that he had learned at the hands of the Vietnam veterans who had trained us. I pay tribute to all of them who put me through the mill at Battle Wing in Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, where of course most of those Vietnam veterans also did their predeployment training to go to Vietnam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think they coped better when they were in the Army, in an organisation that valued their service. But then there were the families of those who came back who did not have that support. The families certainly endured a great deal in living with veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and we should really acknowledge all that they went through over the many years that they had to cope with those psychological issues and other, physical, issues that their family members came back with. Their support for their people and their sacrifice on behalf of this nation as well, not only for those who lost their lives but for those they had to support, is certainly something that we should acknowledge as well as part of the commemoration of this day. We do need to have a better understanding of the day itself. It took a long time before we really appreciated the full strategic and tactical importance of this battle. Delta Company, only a company-strength unit, took on two manoeuvre units of the enemy—the Vietcong 275th Regiment, which itself was composed largely of regulars from the north and the famous, or infamous, D445 battalion of local force Vietcong. So two large manoeuvre units confronted a subunit, the Delta Company, of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. As has been pointed out, they were vastly outnumbered. One thing that strikes you as you read about this battle, or if you see the transcripts or hear the recordings of the radio telephone traffic that took place during the battle, is that you really appreciate the professionalism of these soldiers. Through the incredible stress of what was going on, they maintained their discipline and their professionalism in directing the fire support that they received was first class, and was what actually saved the members of the unit who were able to survive the battle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that respect, I pay tribute today particularly to the New Zealanders who supported our troops—the 161 Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery—and to the service that Captain Morrie Stanley rendered that day. Morrie, unfortunately, passed away on 16 September last year. He was a tremendous professional but also a really fine man. He had tremendous empathy for the soldiers whom he was trying to support. You can see that if you watch the very fine documentary that the Foxtel company produced on this battle. I am so glad that we have that oral history of Morrie, since he left us last year. It was a poignant moment for other veterans of the battle who were able to see him in hospital and hand over to him the decorations that we were able to obtain in recognition of what this battle actually meant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This battle for appropriate recognition was a long-fought battle, particularly by Harry Smith, on behalf of his soldiers over many years. It was only recently that we understood that the efforts of Delta Company in fact saved the 1st Australian Task Force, which at that time was still establishing itself. This was a concerted effort by the enemy to annihilate the task force. Not only did Delta Company and the supporting elements achieve the success that they did and defeat that objective; also, through the overwhelming casualties that were caused to the enemy, they really devastated them to the extent that they were not able to mount such an effort ever again in Phuoc Tuy province. As a result, we were able to contribute to other efforts elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This battle for appropriate recognition is something that is a bit of a shame on this country. I am so pleased that we were finally able to bring that to conclusion. Certainly, we know that the quota system, the system that applied at the time, really denied some of the key players of that battle the recognition that they deserved, such as Harry Smith whose award recommendation was downgraded. So we were able to give him the Star of Gallantry and, similarly, second lieutenants Geoff Kendall and Dave Sabben had their decorations upgraded to the Medal of Gallantry. Subsequent to that, we established the Honours and Awards Tribunal, which looked after a few other unfinished business elements of the battle, such as in relation to Cliff Dohle, one of the Iroquois pilots awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts, and of course the overall awarding of the Unit Citation for Gallantry to Delta Company. They were of course, back in 1968, acknowledged by President Johnson with the Presidential Unit Citation, which I know the unit wears with pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An element of controversy was the South Vietnamese intention towards Delta Company. I was able to get together with Paul Ham, the Vietnam War historian, to get to the bottom of this issue. We were able to uncover diplomatic traffic that clearly indicated that it had been the intention of the South Vietnamese government to award the Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation to that unit. At the time the Australian government rejected that offer and instead members of the unit were given dolls by the Vietnamese, which as you will appreciate did not quite reflect the significance of their efforts. So we were able to clarify that and the members of the unit were awarded that Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation as well. We have managed to clear up a lot of unfinished business from the years when this was a running sore for people like Harry Smith. I know Harry was not able to get to the award ceremony on 18 August that the Governor-General attended, but Harry has been acknowledged by all his soldiers for the massive effort that he has put in over the years on their behalf. Harry, we really salute you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a real privilege for me to have known and had many conversations with Harry, as it has been for me to have known so many of the veterans of this battle—guys like Bob Buick, who I spoke to on the phone only a few days ago. I met many of them at the famous Sporties Bar at 6RAR when I was playing rugby for 6RAR. We won the premiership and these veterans would always turn up to Sporties and share their stories with us—a great bunch of blokes; fantastic people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Probably the most poignant and satisfying moment of my time in politics has been the mission to Vietnam that we went on to bring back the remains of Michael Herbert and Robert Carver, the last two of our service people missing in action in Vietnam, members of No. 2 Squadron, Magpie squadron, flying Canberra bombers. I went over there with a good friend, Alan Curr, who served with both of them, and with me in Timor. It was an incredibly emotional experience travelling over there with the families and veterans of the unit to bring our last two back. In effect, it is mission accomplished, in that we did not leave anybody behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, dealing with the Vietnamese authorities really brought a lot of issues home to us. They were so welcoming, generous and warm hearted in how they received us and the families. It was a tremendous experience, but the poignancy of it was emphasised by the fact that they still have 300,000 of their own missing in action from that war. It is a great source of pride to me that today Australians are assisting the Vietnamese to locate those who are missing in action in battlefields that we served on, and that we have the records and the technical capability to assist them. This is one of the things that is forming a wonderful bond between our two countries now. Something beautiful has actually grown from this horrendous experience. Thousands of Australian students travel to Vietnam, and many Australian tourists as well, and many Vietnamese come to learn and study in Australia. So a wonderful bond and thread has grown up—and also amongst the veterans of both sides in the dealings they have with each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, how we address the situation with the mental health issues that they face is something we have been trying to move on with. I am very pleased that we have had the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training program, which we have put $1 million towards, and that we have introduced the comprehensive mental health 'lifecycle' package. This fell out of the improve mental health studies that we instituted, and $92 million has been allocated for the implementation of both those studies. These are some of the things that need to be done to respond to the issues that emerge from these conflicts, and a lot more is still necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by talking about the importance of maintaining the lessons from that war. All of my career has been basically in a counterinsurgency style environment, and all of those lessons that were taught to us by those Vietnam veterans remain relevant today. I am really pleased that finally we have managed to institutionalise that cultural and historical experience by now creating the Asia Pacific Civil-Military Centre of Excellence, which is based out at Queanbeyan. This takes the lessons that we need to learn from counterinsurgency and emphasises that the types of environments and conflicts we are facing in Afghanistan are not just military. They are social, economic and political issues and they all have to be addressed at the same time and meshed with a cohesive strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having recently spent a week on the ground in Afghanistan, I am delighted to see the impact of that strategy. That reorientation of our approach is really starting to take effect marvellously on the ground in Oruzgan Province, which is recognised by the other contingents in Afghanistan and by the Regional Commander South, who has emphasised that Oruzgan is the model that others should emulate if they are to achieve success in Afghanistan. So the spirit, the experience and the service of these veterans from Vietnam lives on in what our troops today are doing on the ground in Afghanistan. I salute what they gave to me and what they gave to the country. It is a proud tradition, a proud record and a proud experience which we should continue to honour in every way possible.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="KV5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEVILLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Deputy Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  It is an honour to speak in this debate today and to acknowledge the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. The date of 18 August should burn in all our psyches for lots of reasons. Looking back over Australia's military history, there have been great battles like Gallipoli in the First World War, and in the Second World War we talk about the Battle of Britain, El Alamein, Tobruk, the Kokoda Track and Milne Bay. When you get closer to home there is the Battle of Kapyong in Korea and there is Long Tan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Dr Kelly, just said, the Vietnam War left a lot of scars. Today is not the day to apportion blame to individual groups or political parties but, rather, to recognise that there was unacceptable conduct in our nation by some of our own people, who treated the Vietnam veterans abysmally when they returned from that conflict. Some of the veterans have told me that shortly after they got home they were advised by the military to get into civvies and not go out in their uniform—these fellows were not quite discharged, but they were back in Australia—for fear they would be abused and spat on. That really is a dreadful indictment on all of us. I put myself in that category. It was against that backdrop that those who fought in Vietnam, particularly those who fought in some of the seminal battles, like Firebase Coral and Long Tan, were never properly recognised. In fact, in the case of Harry Smith, Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall—whom the parliamentary secretary just spoke about—their honours, recommended at the Battle of Long Tan, were actually downgraded. What a disgrace; what an utter disgrace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 45th anniversary was an opportunity to put that right. We have not been really good at acknowledging some of our heroes, and it is good that we now have a tribunal looking into the cases of people—even of people from the Second World War, like Teddy Sheean. Just imagine that young man going down and firing his machine gun as the waves came up around him! He would not leave his post. It is the stuff of legend. We recently celebrated the death of the White Mouse and her contribution to the war effort. She was the most decorated woman of the Second World War. She was one of ours, but it took us 60 years to acknowledge her effort. The 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan was a time to put some of the ghosts to rest, to put some of our bad attitudes away and to recognise the Battle of Long Tan for what it was. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the honour of being paired with Minister Warren Snowdon and going to Brisbane to see the parade. And what a moving ceremony that was: the whole 6RQR on parade at Enoggera Barracks; the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Morrison; the Governor-General; and, most particularly, of those who served at Long Tan there were over 80 soldiers, and widows. When you allow for the 108 who were there and the headquarters people, there were probably 120 in all—Harry Smith says probably about 120—and 80 of them could be there on that day to see the unit honoured. What a phenomenal day it was. The drill was impeccable, the music was perfect and the overlay was these 80 veterans. They have this ceremony where the troops march in open order through the ranks of the serving troops, and seeing them marching through the ranks brought the crowd to its feet with applause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that struck us was that the Governor-General placed a wreath on the cross. We have different memorials for different activities in our history. If you go around Australia you will find that most of the memorials to the Battle of Tobruk are in the shape of the memorial that was built in the cemetery at Tobruk. If you go to Vietnam War memorials, you find that quite a lot of them are in the shape of the Long Tan cross, which is a roughly hewn cross with a circular panel, not quite a Celtic cross—I think all the honourable members would know what I am talking about. One of those crosses is at Enoggera Barracks, where the wreath was laid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned Harry Smith, who was to be awarded the DSO, which was downgraded to a Military Cross and then upgraded again to the Star of Gallantry, which is the equivalent of the DSO. But the awards for Dave Sabin and Geoff Kendall were downgraded from military crosses to military medals and then upgraded again to the Medal for Gallantry. Dave Sabin had never received his and it was presented to him by the Governor-General, and the Unit Citation for Gallantry, which should have been awarded 44 or 45 years ago, was presented to the other lieutenant, Geoff Kendall. They both served beside Harry Smith in the battle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Harry attended the Long Tan celebrations in Townsville. As a result of a recent medical treatment, he was not able to fly to Brisbane, and that was a sad thing because if it was anyone's day it was Harry Smith's. As you watched that magnificent parade, you could not help reflecting on what he did on that day. As the parliamentary secretary and others have mentioned, the Battle of Long Tan occurred by chance. A D Company, 6RQR patrol had gone out and, at around midday or early-afternoon, they encountered 2½ thousand Vietcong and North Vietnamese regulars—quite a formidable force. As we subsequently know, their real target was the base at Nui Dat, where there was to be a concert that day with Little Pattie and Johnny O'Keefe. It would have been a light and frothy day, so just imagine 2½ thousand troops descending on that. What a bloodbath that would have been. By chance, while out on patrol, the Australians ended up in battle with this group. They were a well-equipped group, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has just said. They had artillery as well. It was on the edge of the rubber plantation and it was in pouring rain. The battle raged for three hours—105 Australians and three New Zealanders took on 2,500 North Vietnamese regulars and irregulars. Shocking sorts of odds. You read the battle—and we do not have time to go into every aspect of it—but for example at one stage one of the platoons was surrounded and two other platoons went out to relieve them to fight their way into their position and to get them out back to the Australian line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was Morrie Stanley the New Zealand artillery officer who was lying beside Harry Smith, right at the front, in three inches of muddy water calling down the artillery that was coming from three units—Australian, American and New Zealander. That barrage was exploding in the rubber plantation and was causing devastating injuries to the North Vietnamese attackers. As I said, the battle went on for three hours. At one stage they nearly ran out of ammunition and equally bravely the RAAF flew in with an improvised drop of ammunition wrapped in blankets in the thick of the battle. That too was enormously courageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They persisted and they won the battle. They saved most of their unit. Tragically they lost 18 with 24 wounded but one only shudders to think what might have happened if that group had got anywhere near Nui Dat on that day. So they also saved the pride of Australia in that battle and as Parliamentary Secretary Kelly just told us it weakened for all time the role of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese regulars in that province. So that was what we celebrated—45 years since that event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stay very close to my Vietnam veterans because I think they have had a rougher time than most. There were even some RSL clubs that would not accept them as members, thankfully not a lot, but some would not and that was a great sense of unhappiness to them. They did not lose their sense of camaraderie and having served for Australia and in many towns they formed their owned branches, some as South Vietnam Veterans' Association and others as South East Asian Group. In my area both main groups, the one in Bundaberg, has its own headquarters and as the local member I took some pride in helping them with former ministers and being able to get funds to purchase accommodation—it was an old church that they have turned into a very nice club. In Hervey Bay the old historic railway station is also now the headquarters of the Vietnam Veterans' Association Hervey Bay Sub-Branch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You often wonder just how much healing had really gone on but I think it was two or three years ago I went to the Long Tan Day at Hervey Bay and Harry Smith had some of his unit with him; I think there were eight of them. They went up as a group to lay their wreaths and as they laid their wreaths and stepped back the entire crowd—which was considerable I might add—burst into loud and sustained applause. I have never seen that at a wreath laying. Wreath laying is generally a very sombre thing; a reflective thing. But, on that occasion, the members of the public who were there could not contain themselves because they knew the story of how badly these men had been treated as veterans but also, in particular, how badly D company 6RAR had been treated in the acknowledgement of what was the seminal battle of the Vietnam War. I return to an earlier theme, when I said we are not very good at recognising our heroes. Two of the 11 have received some awards, but there are still nine who have received only MIDs, mentioned in dispatches, which hardly reflects what went on that day. They were all recommended by Harry on that day for truly exceptional courage, and I will not rest until those 11 are upgraded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I bring that up not to put a political or dark overlay on the celebration of Long Tan Day but rather to say that there is still some unresolved business. We as a nation need to step back and take one last look, as we put this behind us, to make sure that we have honoured truly exceptional courage and, in the case of Harry Smith, Dave Sabben, Geoff Kendall and Morrie Stanley, truly exceptional leadership, and that we do not forget the ones who really stuck their necks out for this country, those last 11. Long Tan Day is a marvellous day, a day that is now well established in the Australian lexicon. I hope that it will lead to complete fulfilment in the coming years, once we have acknowledged the last 11 veterans.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  Last Thursday marked the 45th anniversary of the legendary Vietnam battle at Long Tan, where 105 Australians and three New Zealanders fought and withstood an attack of some 2,500 Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops in a rubber plantation. At the end of that battle, 18 Australian soldiers had been killed and 24 wounded, while 800 of the North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded. The Battle of Long Tan, involving B Company and D Company 6RAR, was probably the most famous action of Vietnam fought by the Anzacs. As long as Long Tan is remembered as one of the major battles in Vietnam for our troops, it will also represent a day that veterans come together with members of the community to pay their respects on what is now Vietnam Veterans Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Vietnam War was the longest major conflict in which Australians have been involved. It lasted 10 years, from 1962 to 1972. In the electorate of McEwen, as occurs all over Australia, veterans, families, friends and supporters come together to reflect on and remember all of the 62,100 Australian service personnel and civilians who fought in the name of our country, the 521 Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice and the 2,398 who were wounded.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the nearly four decades since the end of the Vietnam War, there has been much heartache and much healing. Although people will differ in their opinions on the Vietnam War, I personally want to put on the record my total admiration and respect for and thanks to all those who bravely went to war and how sorry I am for the mistreatment they received on their return. Our troops deserve our unqualified support and respect. These brave men and women are the ones who are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country and the beliefs we hold so dearly. For that courage and bravery, I want to say thank you. I, like many Australians, have visited Vietnam and been through Phuoc Tuy province and walked through the rubber plantations at Long Tan. I have been to the Australian task force base at Nui Dat and been through the tunnels at Cu Chi. I have stood at these sites; I have walked the Luscombe airstrip. I have reflected and paid my respects to the brave Australians. I must say it was a very haunting, emotional and overwhelming experience. I want to thank the tour guide who was with me, an ex-6RAR man, Breaker Cusack. Breaker really brought the whole thing to reality as we walked through the rubber plantations and the silence. With each step he talked about what happened here and what happened there before you finally get to the cross. You pay your respects to soldiers  from both sides who fought in that battle. One of the things I noticed in Vietnam was the reconciliation that has happened since that time and the warmth that Australians receive there. It was a very haunting experience to walk through those different battlefields and places of significance for Australian veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of McEwen has a long and rich history of supporting our armed forces and the township of Seymour, in particular, has a proud military tradition. Since the Boer War the area has housed Army training camps. After Federation this troop camp became part of the 7th Australian Light Horse, camped at site 17, which we now know and recognise as the Australian Light Horse Memorial Park, a place of great significance to Australia and a place I think many Australians should visit to see the fields where the Anzac traditions were born and what they went through. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During World War I a permanent camp was set up and in the 1920s the Seymour shire became the chief military area in the state. Eventually this led to the establishment of Puckapunyal Army Camp in World War II. During World War II my grandfather, George Mitchell, passed through there on his way to places like Tobruk, Alamein and Borneo, where he and many others fought for our freedom. To me, it makes sense that Seymour is proudly honouring all those who served in Vietnam with the construction of the Vietnam veterans commemorative walk. It will be an area for reflection and commemoration for the Vietnam veterans and their families. It will have over 300 metres of stainless steel walls with the name of every Australian personnel who served in Vietnam. The Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Commemorative Walk is not to memorialise those who served in Vietnam and/or those who paid the ultimate price, but to commemorate the service of all who played their part in what turned out to be a tumultuous part of Australia's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the stories of Vietnam are represented in a replica of Luscombe Bowl, which was once the entertainment venue set up by soldiers during the war, at the end of Luscombe Airfield at Nui Dat. The replica centre in Seymour is now an interpretive centre. The next stage of the walk will have imitation rubber trees, rice paddies and military artefacts. Through this government we have secured a Centurian tank and we are working very hard to obtain a M113APC, some M2A2 Howitzers and our ultimate goal is to get a Huey helicopter. At the opening of stage 1 of the commemorative walk, veterans came from all around our nation to this place of significance, because it was born by them for them. It was something to behold. They were the ones who put the idea together of the commemorative walk and they are the ones who turned up in droves to see it. One of the most interesting things was to see people who had not seen each other for many, many years getting together, having a celebration and enjoying what had been done by Labor governments, both state and federal, getting together and putting the money in to get this fantastic venture done. It will become a tourist attraction for many of the veterans who are entering the grey nomad phase so they can see the importance of what they have done for our country and to see all their names on a wall. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Australian commitment consisted predominantly of Army personnel but there was also a significant number of Air Force, Navy and some civilian personnel who were involved throughout the Vietnam conflict. As I said earlier, the later parts of the war were the cause of social and political dissent in Australia—since the conscription referendums of the First World War. It was a part of our history and only time has been able to heal the emotional wounds of so many. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first recall my interest being sparked in the Vietnam conflict, and the resulting issues that veterans faced, when my good friend, Craig Ingram—the former member for Gippsland in the Victorian parliament—loaned me a copy of a book titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Well Done, </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Those Men</span> by Barry Heard. I read that book straight through from start to finish and could not put it down. It was a fascinating read because it was about Barry's very personal account. It explains how, as a conscript, he was one of the many young men sent off to Vietnam, completely unprepared for the emotional and psychological impact of what they would do and what they would have done to them there. As a result, he spent the next 30 years having 'a slow motion breakdown'. His story of his long journey home from Vietnam is an inspiring story of a life reclaimed and it gives strength to that generation of Australian men who had been through very similar experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that awakening experience, I have continued to work and support the brave men and women who were prepared to pay the ultimate sacrifice in the name of our country. There are many Vietnam veterans in my community and I can say that they are a dogged lot, especially when it comes to getting funds up and running for this Vietnam veterans commemorative walk. I guess that is what makes them so special. Recently, I was very honoured to present some 'Saluting their service' certificates to two of our finest—locals, Tony Gill and Bill Scott, residents of McEwen and people whom I am very proud to have made their acquaintance. In doing these ceremonies, we invited one of the primary schools who had just finished doing a term's work on military history. It was an absolute sensation to have those guys there getting their certificates, being recognised for what they have done, and to have this young generation of kids there with so much interest, passion and support for everything that they had been through in their schoolwork.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my last note, I would like to say a simple thank you. Time cannot change the past, but what we do know can change the future and make us sure that this episode in Australian history is recognised and given the reverence and attention that it so richly deserves. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MATHESON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  It is with great honour that I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women of Australia's armed forces who fought for this country in Vietnam between 23 May 1962 and 29 April 1975. The nominal role of the Vietnam veterans includes 61,000 men and women who served in the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force in Vietnam or in the waters adjacent to Vietnam during this time. On Vietnam Veterans Day last week, I was pleased to see survivors of Delta Company 6RAR honoured with a Unit Citation for Gallantry for their actions in the Battle of Long Tan. It is a shame it has taken 45 years for these fine soldiers to be recognised. Let us hope we have learned from our past when recognising the sacrifice and service of our ADF personnel now and into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not detracting from the inspiring efforts of Delta Company 6RAR and the Battle of Long Tan, today I would also like to make mention of the 103rd Field Battery, who supported Delta Company in the Battle of Long Tan all those years ago. They were part of four artillery units from 1 Field Regiment at Nui Dat, which also included the 161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Army; 105th Field Battery, Royal Australian Army; and A Battery, 2nd/35th Howitzer Battalion, US Army. My father was a member of 103 Field Battery and fought gallantly in the battle. It was one of the biggest and most important conflicts in the Vietnam War involving Australian troops. Whilst my father understands and accepts that 103 Field Battery will not receive a citation due military protocols, I believe every member of this battery, and all other support batteries, would be worthy recipients. I have been approached by family members of these men who also believe these soldiers deserve recognition for their efforts during the Battle of Long Tan, even though they were officially attached to 5RAR. It saddened me on Vietnam Veterans Day last week to have a number of phone calls from people crying and reliving their stories. I believe that these support batteries should be shown the respect and honour they deserve. Surely this is not too much to ask.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The battle was one of the most successful campaigns Australian troops have ever been involved in. Eighteen Australians died, while the enemy death toll was put as high as 800. It was August 18 1966 when 108 Australian and New Zealand soldiers of the 6th Battalion, RAR, D Company faced an enemy force of over 2½ thousand. The 103 Field Battery played a pivotal role in this historic battle. Its members pounded the enemy with 1,000 rounds of artillery, a round every 10 seconds, creating a wall of steel around the embattled men of D Company. Revisiting this battle: non-military personnel at the base formed ad hoc teams of labourers and worked through the night in the pouring rain to keep up the supply of ammunition to the guns. The 103 Field Battery had to be resupplied by Iroquois choppers from 9 Squadron RAAF, making the guns a prime target for enemy fire. These men struggled through torrential rain which made aiming the guns almost impossible, leaving gunners to rely on their own intuition to ensure they fired on the enemy and not on the men of D Company. To make a bad situation worse, poisonous cordite fumes from the artillery fire built up a toxic haze around the guns. Despite hardly being able to breathe or even see through the haze, the brave men of the 103rd and 105th field batteries kept up the artillery fire all through the night and into the morning, delivering victory to the Australians. The men involved in the Battle of Long Tan demonstrated courage, bravery and determination in spite of next to impossible conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for these reasons that I believe that the members of 103 Field Battery are also worthy of citation. Even though military protocol prevents this citation from happening, I will always be immensely proud of my father, Reg, for his courageous actions on that horrific day. Unfortunately, the Vietnam War was especially cruel to the minds and bodies of returned servicemen because of the strong political anti-war sentiments that were rife at the time. While the success of the Battle of Long Tan will be remembered by generations of Australians to come, we must also consider the effect the war has had on many soldiers, their families and the community. I remember vividly as a young child my father returning from Vietnam. We used to go into his bedroom, where he slept with his eyes open, to try and wake him up. He would jump up and nearly strangle you, reliving the war in Vietnam. He slept with his eyes open. He relived every moment of Vietnam in his dreams. I remember him sleepwalking through the house. Still to this day, when I visit him on holiday, my father relives those memories in his dreams. These are things that I will never forget and they touch me deeply. As a young child it was very, very disturbing to see what was happening to my father, and it still happens to him today and to the many Vietnam Veterans who returned from war, especially those who were involved in the Battle of Long Tan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently more than 500 Vietnam Veterans living in the Macarthur region. I am a member of the Macarthur branch of Australian Vietnam Veterans and I have always supported its members in whatever I can do, particularly in relation to their health and their wellbeing. The veterans of this group are a fantastic group of men who have all fought gallantly for this country. Now they meet on a daily basis to offer support to each other. They have established a museum in memory of those who fought in Vietnam. I am proud of all our local veterans, not only for their courage during battle but for their strength during the anti-war sentiments that targeted our troops after their return home. My hope is that Australia will never allow Defence Force personnel returning from duty to be treated as Vietnam Veterans were. I know that a number of speakers today have touched on this. There are few who will endure the haunting realities of war. We should not take these soldiers' personal sacrifice for granted. My hope for all Australian Vietnam veterans, including my father, is that 45 years later they can all hold their heads up high.</span>

                  <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  It is an honour to follow the member for Macarthur on this. I know this is an issue that is very close to his heart as I recall he spoke about his father's commitment in the Vietnam War in his first speech to the House. I also rise today to pay tribute to the veterans of Long Tan and to all the Australians who served in the Vietnam War. As the member for Fowler—and I have to say this—it probably has an even more special significance for me, given that I also represent one of the largest Vietnamese communities outside Vietnam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commemorations that took place throughout the country on 18 August certainly did stir the emotions and the spirit of all involved in the conflict, their families and those who recognise the effort that was put in on behalf of the nation. As in all other theatres of conflict in which Australian soldiers have served, these Australians served bravely in Vietnam, they served their nation with courage and they served it with distinction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that—and following the point just made by the member for Macarthur—the veterans of the Vietnam conflict were treated very poorly on their return to this country. No matter what your views may have been with respect to the Vietnam War, those who served this country in our country's interests did not deserve to be treated the way they were when they returned to this country. I would like to put on record my apologies to all those veterans who were subject to that treatment. It is something that needs to be said as the grieving is still taking place for many of those Vietnam veterans. There is no excuse at all for treating our returned servicemen and, indeed, some women that way. After all, they were the ones who were called to put their lives on the line when their country needed it. Their dedication and their commitment to service must be honoured. They dedicated themselves to the service of this country, no matter how they were recruited to Vietnam—many were national servicemen who were drafted into it. But regardless of how they came to be in the war, they did service in the interest of the Australian nation and they discharged their duty with all due valour and honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that does sit very solidly in the Australian psyche. You do not have to attend many Vietnam veteran occasions to see this. It is not only the pride of the returned servicemen you see there. I see it, and no doubt the member for Macarthur and all the other members present know that you actually see it, in the school children who are now turning up as they learn about our commitment. It is quite clear that this is the day we not only the commemorate the battle at Long Tan, but also the day we remember all those who served in the Vietnam War. The Battle of Long Tan stands equally proudly in Australian military history with Gallipoli, the Somme, Tobruk and Kokoda. These are things that young school children now learn, and rightfully so, because they are things that they should be proud to know. It was an engagement against all the odds, where Australians were called upon to engage an enemy in what was probably a very much unforseen battle under very, very difficult circumstances. Long Tan was the first major engagement in Vietnam in which Australian troops were involved. This battle was the stuff that, quite frankly, legends were made of. Once again, Australian soldiers found themselves in a position where only their sheer bravery and their determination allowed them to stand against the odds. You draw lines of similarity with all those other theatres, such as Gallipoli, the Somme, Tobruk and Kokoda. We should recall that Delta Company 6RAR encountered a far superior force numerically as they fought in the rain, mud and mist of the rubber plantation that ran along the outside of the village of Long Tan. No-one could have reasonably expected that a force of 108 Australians, mostly young National Service men, led by a few regulars, with the support of artillery, including some Australian and New Zealand artillery as it turned out, could have held off a force the equivalent of almost two battalions. It comprised over 2,000 North Vietnamese army regulars and local Viet Cong guerrillas. There was wave after wave of enemy attack on the Australian position. During the few hours that this battle lasted, there were many acts of bravery and mateship which have come to typify Australian involvement in war. To put it realistically, it is the Anzac spirit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For three hours they fought in the rain, with nothing more than a few plantation rubber trees and the mist generated by the rain for cover. They were waiting all that time for reinforcements to arrive. In the Anzac tradition, as I said, these Australians were supported by both Australian and New Zealand artillery. Sadly, lives on both sides were lost that day. By the end of the battle, 18 Australians had lost their lives and another 24 had been wounded. It is interesting that the oldest Australian casualty on that occasion was a 22-year-old and the youngest was a 19-year-old. That puts it in context when you think about your own kids. The other side, I understand, lost in excess of 250, with another 500 wounded. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned at the outset, despite the significance of the Long Tan Battle, its commemoration is not simply of the battle itself but of all Vietnam veterans. It is about the nearly 500,000 who served in Vietnam, it is about the soldiers and it is about the families of the 500 Australian troops who lost their lives in service to their country. It is also about the 3,000 who were wounded during the conflict. Everyone who served in the Vietnam conflict deserves proper recognition and the full respect of the Australian people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We always need to be mindful of the fact that, even though the last of our troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1972, it was not until October 1987 that Australia officially held ceremonies to recognise the homecoming of our Vietnam veterans. Vietnam veterans throughout Australia continue to suffer and are haunted by the ghosts of their involvement in the war. It is an important part of Australian history and should be given that status. I hope that no group of Australian veterans is ever treated in the way that we treated our Vietnam heroes on their homecoming. That is a wrong that we need to right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Fowler, I now have the honour of representing one of the largest Vietnamese communities outside of Vietnam itself. As a consequence of that, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War takes on a special significance. On 30 April this year, I attended a ceremony in Canberra to commemorate the 36th anniversary of the fall of Saigon to remember not only the Australians soldiers but also the many thousands of Vietnamese soldiers who died fighting for freedom and democracy. I had the opportunity to speak about the fall of Saigon to the communist forces and about what had occurred to the nation subsequent to that—for instance, the imprisonment of various Vietnamese people for essentially trying to exercise their own fundamental human rights—the human rights that Australians, New Zealanders and Americans were there supporting and trying to protect at the time of the Vietnamese conflict. At the time of the commemoration ceremonies of the fall of Saigon, I was advised of a march that was being planned by members of the Australian RSL and former Viet Cong soldiers. I reminded the crowd on that day that unlike the First and Second World Wars there was no repatriation for Vietnamese refugees. At the conclusion of the Vietnam war the communist government reacted quite cruelly to any of those it suspected of having stood up against it or assisted in efforts against the communist insurgency, to the point that people were placed in very inhumane concentration camps or, as they are colloquially referred to, re-education camps. The communist government's actions forced millions of Vietnamese to flee their country, many in boats. They would have been, from Australia's point of view, the first boat people. Regrettably, many hundreds of thousands of people did not survive that journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am deeply concerned at human rights in Vietnam—it is something I have spoken of on many occasions in this parliament—because not only is it a continuation of past abuses of one's rights but also Australia, with its allies, fought in Vietnam to support and to protect the basic issues of freedom and democracy. Regrettably, these days people are accused of crimes such as supporting political groups not recognised by the state, criticising government policies, calling for democracy, even being interviewed by foreign journalists. Those matters are enough to subject you to a trial and, if found guilty, you are imprisoned. Our troops fought with distinction and with valour but they fought for Australia's interests to protect people from the insurgency of a communist regime. As a consequence they fought to protect those basic rights that we in our nation can freely enjoy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I applaud every effort towards world peace and harmony, I believe, as I indicated on that day, that a parade by former Australian diggers who served in the Vietnam conflict alongside former Viet Cong guerrillas will send a very wrong message throughout our region. There has been a significant number of recorded abuses of human rights, continuing to this day, including more than 400 people incarcerated for trying to exercise their fundamental human rights. A parade will effectively say that you can continue to deny people their freedom and democracy whilst enjoying the support of a country such as Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year I was also invited to the unveiling of the newly renovated Vietnam War Comradeship Memorial at Cabravale Park, which is in my electorate at Cabramatta. I was invited there by the President of the New South Wales chapter of the Vietnamese Community in Australia, Mr Thanh Nguyen. The community I represent are so proud of all Australians and all those allied forces who went and fought valiantly on their behalf. They have been busy fundraising to ensure that the comradeship memorial stands with pride of place because they want to demonstrate in Australia how proud they are of people which o made the sacrifice on their behalf. The comradeship memorial commemorates the friendship and sacrifice shared between Australian and Vietnamese soldiers. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the organising committee, among them Tri Vo, the project coordinator for the upgrade of the comradeship memorial, the presidents of the respective RSL clubs and the many Australian and Vietnamese war veterans who attend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Vietnam War is not going to be something we simply condemn to the history books; it is something that we will commemorate on the basis that it is a true example of the Anzac spirit. It is a defining moment not only in Australian military history but for the spirit of Australia itself. The 18th of August is a very significant day in Australia's national calendar. We commemorate and acknowledge the efforts, bravery, courage and commitment of all of those who fought for this country, whether they were regular soldiers or members of the national service. We should ensure that we speak about this each year in commemoration of Long Tan. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  What marvellous recognition it would have been if my Vietnam veterans could have been here in this parliament in the last hour or so and heard the heartfelt addresses from the members for Macarthur, Fowler and Eden-Monaro. I could not even contemplate entering into the feelings that they have for their communities, especially the Vietnam vets community, but I am sure that if my Vietnam vets were here they would know that there are members in this place who remember what they did, determinedly work for their betterment through this parliament and their communities and do it with a passion and an understanding that they probably do not believe exists in this House. I want to commend them for that in the first instance and say, 'I recognise you.' As the member for Macarthur pointed out, when you have direct family pain such as he has been prepared to volunteer to the records of this parliament and you come into this place, it is great recognition not just for your father but for all the Vietnam vets who have felt alienated from the communities that they left to go to Vietnam and then returned to in difficult circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great pleasure of being the debutant partner for Margaret Kennedy. Margaret Kennedy was the draper's daughter in Pakenham and I was from the neighbouring town of Koo-wee-rup. Those towns were sporting mortal enemies, but I had the great pleasure of being invited to escort this girl to make her debut. Her brother was Robert Kennedy. We called him 'Noddy'—Noddy was taller than most boys—and I was with him yesterday. But Noddy is not Noddy anymore; he is now 'Buzz'. We were different people in the 1960s. It was a wonderful time for all of us, but those who went off to Vietnam had a different experience. It was a distant war for us. We went on. I was not balloted. We got on with our lives. Buzz went through the Vietnam War and I met him yesterday as a member of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club's Gippsland chapter. Having grown up with my wife, Bronwyn, he was thrilled to see her there with all the other Vietnam vets. We remember that even in this House we had Tim Fischer and Rod Atkinson, who were returned soldiers. I do not know whether there were any others; someone might fill me in, I will get back to the office and someone will say there was someone else. There was Ron Edwards, the Western Australia member for Swan; I think it was Swan. I think that is correct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BROADBENT:</span>
                  </a>  It was Cowan; he was the member for Cowan, of course. He came back with severe injuries but ended up in this House. So that is three that we can think of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday there were many, many beautiful motorbikes. There were also a lot of fractured men and families. They were supported by God's Squad, and I should have said that Buzz is a patched member of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club chapter in Gippsland. I can only enter in but cannot understand how their fractured lives have affected all of them over those years and how they congregate around Harley-Davidsons. It is a lovely way to be, because they are with their own. They are in their comfort zone. Yesterday you would have been proud of every one of them, including Russell Oakes —'T Rat', as I have to call him—who was a president of the club. They had organised around their memorial and around their clubhouse there at the old Longwarry Hall, which they had made into a fantastic clubhouse. They had organised a whole ceremony to remember Vietnam Veterans Day and the Long Tan remembrance. In that, probably the most heartbreaking moment was when the words of the song <span style="font-style:italic;">I Was Only 19</span> were not sung but just read out as a poem. There were many tears that flowed in those few moments as that was read out. The sun was shining on a most glorious day in Gippsland—unusual with the wet we have had. So you can imagine the sparkling motorcycles surrounding this whole place. Not all the Vietnam veterans there came on motorbikes, you know; some came in cars. There were people like me, hangers on, that came along to the commemoration with them. But you felt a quiet comfort in the place as they remembered those fallen and as they remembered their mates who have fallen since and who have not made it into what we call old age—and there was a lot of grey hair yesterday; I think the boys would forgive me for saying that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to recognise one—not only the boys who were there yesterday at Longwarry but all the support that they have had around them from their loved ones that support them in what they do; all of the people that went away with them to support them and that were part of that conflict; and the Defence Force support that came from this nation for them. That probably has not been recognised either, but they know who helped them. I will come to a plea in a moment, but I will just say this to you: yesterday, as a member of parliament, you would have been proud to stand amongst those men at the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club commemorations at Longwarry. It was a place where any member of this House would have been pleased to be standing. I know the former minister knows all about what I am talking about because he was the minister when much of these funds that were provided to this group were extended, allowing them to rebuild what they have done there at the moment. There is a bit of controversy right now over some money that is not going out to veterans in regard to welfare. I have raised that with the new minister and we are doing the best we possibly can. I admit that Victoria has had generous payments in regard to the welfare of veterans and that there has been a pull back. But I have a different set-up in Gippsland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are welfare agencies quite close to each other across parts of Australia and they may be duplicating services. Government always has a right to question its own expenditure—there is no doubt about that. However, South Gippsland has one service only and it goes from Wonthaggi all the way through the bottom country to Fish Creek, the Foster area, then right up to Korumburra and Leongatha—one service. I have been told there are some transitional funds, so I think in the process we can work through that for those transitional funds. In the north of my electorate, I do not have the same issue because there are welfare support groups for veterans all the way through. I think we will get a good outcome from the government on that. I have been in this parliament through a number of administrations and there has not been one administration in this place, from Hawke to Gillard, that I have been a part of that was not totally and absolutely supportive of the welfare of veterans, to the best of the government's financial ability. There has not been one Prime Minister who has not been in support of veterans, as best they possibly could in the financial straits of the government of the time. If we have failed veterans, we will take responsibility for that and endeavour in the processes into the future to support veterans and support them well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vietnam Veterans Day was a great celebration. I congratulate all at Longwarry. I congratulate all who played a part in its presentation. But the moment of excitement came when one training aeroplane from the Roulettes came straight out of the sunlight towards the clubhouse, twisting and turning and throwing itself up into the air to a complete stall, then dropping towards the clubhouse again, circling three times, rolling and then flinging itself back to sail—a fitting tribute that is only given to very special occasions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="VU5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GRIFFIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  I rise tonight to honour our Vietnam veterans and to make some comments with respect to Vietnam Veterans Day and the Battle of Long Tan, and to remember all those who fought and those who died, and those who suffered as a result of our involvement in the Vietnam War. In the process, I will mention some of the people I have met in my time in this place, both as shadow minister and subsequently as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, where I have had the honour and the privilege to work with many members of the Vietnam veterans community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many speakers have spoken about the Battle of Long Tan and the nature of what occurred on that occasion, the tremendous courage and bravery of all those who fought as part of that engagement and who safeguarded the very real threat to the Australian base at Nui Dat, recently established, and the nature of the struggle that occurred subsequent to that time around the question of honours and recognition. I will not go into the detail of that other than to make a couple of comments about several of the individuals that were involved, to highlight those individuals as examples of the very fine men who fought on that occasion—and recognising them as representative takes nothing away from others whom I do not mention. I will then talk a bit more about some other broader points with respect to our involvement in the Vietnam War. I note the presence of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs prior to me, the honourable member for Dunkley. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot really go past then Major—subsequently Lieutenant-Colonel retired—Harry Smith. Harry is someone who I have had a lot to do with over the years, as I know the member for Dunkley had, in what was for government a very difficult issue to deal with: the question of how to deal with recognition with respect to events long ago when we were but very young lads and when, it is acknowledged on all sides, things did not turn out the way they should have in terms of acknowledging the great courage and sacrifice that occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Harry is an amazing bloke. He is as tough as nails, as hard as they come. There were times, it is fair to say—and I am prepared to say it now that I am not minister—he was bloody unreasonable. But, if I were ever in the dire situation that D Company was in, with its support units at that time, in that awful rank jungle, in that terrible driving rain, facing such a numerically superior force, I would have wanted someone like Harry Smith there to help me maintain what I needed to do in the circumstances. I have no doubt—from dealing with him over the years with respect to the outstanding matters which relate to acknowledging his men for what they did—that he is a man of enormous conviction, enormous courage and the sort of guts that a lot of people in this place, me included, can only dream about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Harry remains committed to continuing to focus on and fight for recognition for a number of his men who he feels have not been recognised. I welcome the recent granting of the unit citation as long overdue recognition. It took a long time to get to the stage of being able to have the presentation. There were certainly issues around that, but I will not go to that today. I know from speaking to Harry very recently that those other issues remain outstanding and he remains concerned with aspects of the decisions taken at the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. I think there are issues around the operation of the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. Several issues have come before it where there have been legitimate concerns raised. I think it has an incredibly complex role to play dealing with outstanding matters of recognition, but I think it is also time for that tribunal to be reviewed. It has been in operation for long enough for that to occur, and it would be a positive step forward to ensure that a tribunal which does, by and large, a very good and important job is meeting the requirements that the government had when it was established.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also mention Captain Morrie Stanley, who, as other speakers have mentioned, recently passed away. Then Captain Morrie Stanley was the forward artillery observer attached to the artillery, a Kiwi and a man who directed some 61 artillery fire missions into the site over 3½ hours in the most desperate times and the most appalling conditions. Morrie was able to be granted the unit citation in the time before his passing. Morrie Stanley was a modern epitome of the great linkage between Australia and New Zealand that dates back to the time of Gallipoli and he was a man that was enormously respected by those he worked with. No doubt, given the work he did at that time, his professionalism, his dedication and his skill saved many Australian lives. One other person I would mention in passing—again, someone who would be known to the former minister—is Lieutenant Adrian Roberts, who was in charge of the APCs that arrived in support of D Company. Adrian is one of the people whose individual acts of valour I do not believe have been sufficiently recognised. He came back a man suffering from the circumstances of his service but, always dedicated to helping others, he became involved in the TPI association and served fellow TPIs with great distinction in some of the years since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently came back from Afghanistan. I was talking to a bunch of young blokes at Tarin Kowt, who were serving, and a young bloke came up to me and said, 'I think you might know my grandfather.' He was in fact Adrian's grandson serving in a very similar unit and therefore following on a great tradition. He is a young bloke whom I am sure Adrian is very proud of, and I believe Adrian has every right to be incredibly proud of him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was not just Long Tan. This was a day to recognise the tremendous courage, sacrifice and service of the more than 60,000 who served in Vietnam and the region throughout the conflict. It is a time to recognise that it was not just the Army; it was also the Air Force and it was also the Navy. It is a time to recognise that, although more than 500 died and more than 2,400 were wounded, many others have returned and have suffered from their service. It is a time to acknowledge that service. It is a time to recognise that these men did what they were asked to do on behalf of the governments of the day and many suffered in silence for years afterwards. It is important to recognise that at that time it was a difficult situation in Australian society in dealing with the issues of that conflict—partly, in my view, because it was in effect the first TV war. In those circumstances, the issues we deal with today, with the sorts of reporting that we now almost take for granted, were in fact incredibly new at that time. We were not used to seeing the sorts of scenes that were coming across our TV screens on a nightly basis. We as a society, and frankly our political leaders, were not able to understand at the time or reflect properly on the reality of that and what it meant for a society dealing with the circumstances around a conflict of that nature. I think that that impacted on those who went, their families at home and the broader community and we did a disservice, as a nation, to those who returned in those circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But rather than focus on that I would like to focus on some aspects of what has happened since then that really highlight the great courage and camaraderie of many of those who went. I will briefly speak about a particular group of individuals who served in the Vietnam War who were also very familiar to the former minister, those around Operation Aussies Home. People like Jim Bourke and Peter Aylett, who never forgot that there were some six individuals who were missing in action subsequent to our involvement in that war; people who remembered that and never forgot; people who have dedicated in recent years a lot of their time, money and efforts to doing all they could to bring those men home. The work that they did has been acknowledged in this place before, but I am very pleased to acknowledge it again today. Jim and Peter in particular are two of that group whom I know reasonably well. Again, they are tough old so-and-sos. They are as gutsy as they come—dry and funny when they want to be and determined and tough when they have to be. It has been a great privilege for me to have known them over these years and to have worked with them. And I am sure that the former minister, the member for Dunkley, would share those sentiments. The work that they did ensured that the Defence Force followed on from that in a manner which ensured that the remains of those brave servicemen, the last of our remains from Vietnam, were returned home over a number of occasions, starting in effect with Parker and Gillson, under the time of the member for Dunkley as minister, through, in my time, to John Gillespie, David Fisher, and then on to Herbert and Carver, the last two who were returned home. Jim Bourke is now working on getting a PhD at a university in Melbourne. I now call him professor and he is now looking at the very issue of what this means in respect of what occurred at the time and also what it means about the efforts to understand remembrance and the work that was done to return these men home. I think his work and the work of those like Peter Aylett with him is in fact work that we can all be very, very proud of.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion that is in my name. The New South Wales north coast has endured floods, damaging winds and torrential rain on a number of occasions in the last two years. The unusually wet weather in late 2010 and early 2011 has devastated our local sugar industry. Many farmers planted crops twice and lost both crops to the wet weather, leaving them with no possibility of a harvest but still out of pocket because of the substantial cost of planting. There are currently some 6,000 hectares of land in northern New South Wales which should be covered with sugar cane but lie unplanted. The New South Wales Canegrowers Association is working with the affected parts of the industry to develop solutions to this problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am calling on the government to match the assistance provided to the Queensland and Victorian farmers following the natural disasters in those states. New South Wales's support measures currently fall some $10,000 short of the assistance available for farmers in Queensland and Victoria, who are able to access up to $25,000 re-establishment assistance in flood declared areas. Unlike in other areas, New South Wales sugar cane is primarily a two-year crop, so the impact of poor conditions in late 2010 will flow through until at least 2012. Canegrowers New South Wales estimates that the 2012 harvest could be 50 per cent lower as a result of poor weather. Canegrowers in northern New South Wales have been forced to take on short-term financing of $1,000 per hectare at a 7 per cent interest rate with the loans to be repaid from the proceeds of the coming crop—an example of the local industry attempting to help itself in a very difficult situation. Unfortunately the crops around Broadwater and Harwood are expected to be the worst in 50 years. Without decent crops in the next couple of years the viability of the cane industry in New South Wales will certainly be called into question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In northern New South Wales sugar cane is a major driver of local economies. Money from sugar cane operations flows through the many different suppliers in towns like Maclean, Yamba and Grafton. The sugar cane industry is one of the region's biggest employers and accounts for $230 million of economic output each year; total direct and indirect employment in the industry is estimated at some 2,200 people. This includes 600 cane farmers and 150 seasonal harvesting workers. The sugar mills provide employment for 450 people. I have been advised that these mills are currently operating at a loss due to the difficulty in conditions and increased costs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cane industry in New South Wales is broken into three regions with each region have a milling facility. Should the tonnage from any of the mill areas fall below sustainability levels, this would bring into question the future operations of those mills. It is vitally important that we maintain the critical mass of product flowing through those mills to retain our industry in the long term. The New South Wales Canegrowers Association put forward a plan which they believed would assist the industry to get back on its feet and assure the sustainability of sugar in northern New South Wales. They estimate that about 6,070 hectares needs to be replanted and, to put this in perspective, that is the equivalent of around 8,900 football fields with the estimated cost of replanting being some $10 million. The industry acknowledges that some losses are manageable and come with the territory, come with what it means to be a farmer; however, the industry also believes that the record adverse events in 2010 and 2011 result in the requirement for a comparatively small amount of government intervention to help get the industry back on its feet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry has put forward a proposal to the government with two important elements. The first problem is the inequity in the disaster assistance provided to canegrowers in New South Wales, and I have touched on that inequity between Queensland and New South Wales. Their second proposal is a package involving a partnership between the Australian government, the New South Wales government and the cane growing industry. The industry is proposing that the cost of replanting be funded equally between the two levels of government and individual growers, and predicts a maximum replanting cost of $1,750 a hectare, with an independent auditing program to ensure the integrity of the scheme. The New South Wales Cane Growers Association met with the member for Page, Janelle Saffin, on 12 July to present its case. However, we are yet to hear of a response from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Sugarcane is generally planted in September and October, and this means we must get the issue sorted out in the next few weeks if we are to avoid irreparable damage to the New South Wales sugar industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These weather related problems in New South Wales are further challenges for Australian industry at a time when many sectors are struggling with increased costs and difficult trading conditions. Manufacturing in Australia is already struggling due to a range of factors. BlueScope steel announced today that it will cut 1,000 jobs and close one of its blast furnaces due to difficult conditions. Recently OneSteel announced it will shed 400 jobs. AWU National Secretary Paul Howes said we are 'facing a major crisis in Australian manufacturing'. Businesses around Australia are facing very difficult trading conditions indeed. The high Aussie dollar is hurting exporters, consumer confidence is low and households are saving more money. Wasteful government spending is helping to keep interest rates higher than they would otherwise be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of working with Australian industries to protect Australian jobs and growing Australian businesses the government is pressing ahead with plans to introduce a carbon tax that will push up the cost of electricity and transport. This particularly affects our cane industry, where transport is such a major factor in the cost of production. Businesses in Australia are crying out for support and a fair go. Instead the government is waging war on Australian businesses and Australian jobs by introducing new taxes, reregulating the labour market and mismanaging government programs. I met recently with cane growers to discuss the impact of the carbon tax. They were deeply concerned about the impact of this tax, particularly on the cost of transport and of operating local sugar mills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the Gillard government does not have the will or the competence to support Australian industries. The New South Wales cane industry desperately needs help from the Australian government to ensure its long-term prosperity. We still await a response from the minister, and I note that the member for Page is in the chamber and will be speaking shortly on this matter. I call on the parliament to support this motion. Hundreds of jobs and local businesses are at stake. Certainly the vibrant, long-term future of the cane industry is very much at stake at this very difficult time.</span>

It would be nice for once to come together and work together in this place for the good of the community and for the good of industry, and I wish the honourable member for Cowper were fair dinkum on this and not playing games with it. I suspect that that is not how it is, so it makes it difficult to say: 'Yes, let's get together. Let's work in the best interests of cane growers on the North Coast.' I have certainly done that, because it is a significant industry in my area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking to that point, it is up to the state government to make the declaration of natural disaster; then the federal assistance kicks in. It was during the period when we had the floods. There were about seven floods in my area in Northern Rivers of varying degrees—major, minor and moderate—as there were across the North Coast area. I was able to hop onto the phone and ring anybody I could at the state level and federal level and say, 'I want these natural disaster declarations as soon as we can'. I knew that the sugar industry would be impacted and I wanted them to have access, as other farmers and small business do, to what we commonly call the cash grants. I wanted to make sure that that happened. That was not something I advertised, but it became known—hence, the thanks in the letter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met with the cane growers since. When I look at the honourable member for Cowper's seven-point motion, points one, two, three, four and five are straight forward. When you come to number six, it talks about the amount of cash available—the $15,000 and $25,000—it is up to the state government to ask the federal government to increase that assistance. That is how it works. It has worked like that for a long time and we can come into this place, we can get into the media and we can talk about that as much as we like, but that is the system that exists. It just muddies the waters if we are not accurate in how we talk about that. It is up to the state government. Whether it was the previous state government, which was a Labor government, or the now  coalition government, it is an issue that I have always said had to be taken up with the state government and the state members. That is absolutely clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other issue, the cane growers did put up a novel proposal for seeking assistance for planting at any level. In their submission they talk about having two crook seasons. There have actually been three major weather events in total over the last four years that have impacted on the sugar cane farmers. That is what they were asking for. I also had written to the Hon. Katrina Hodgkinson, the Minister for Primary Industries and Minister for Small Business. I have a recent letter from her where she said, 'Thank you for the representations on behalf of the New South Wales cane growers.' They wanted me to write to her on the issue of increasing the category C NDRRA Grant from $15,000 to $25,000 and seeking financial support for the replanting of sugar cane. I knew that the state members in my area had done that. I was asked by the cane growers to do it. I was happy to do it, although that is normally within their bailiwick to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I received another letter back from her. The minister says that she is extremely sympathetic to the concerns raised. She said she has had various meetings with local members to discuss these issues and she has also encouraged them to discuss it with the federal minister. That is what we have been doing—discussing it with both. I did not want to do this. I was not bringing partisan politics into this; I was just playing an absolutely straight bat in trying to get the best deal I could for the cane growers. The motion the honourable member for Cowper has put here tonight forces me to bring this in here. It is not what I wanted to do. I just want to see what we can do for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a letter here that the honourable Minister Katrina Hodgkinson enclosed for me. It is to Mr Andrew Tickle, the General Secretary of the New South Wales Cane Growers' Association, to his address at Wardell. I also meet with Mr Tickle as well on behalf of the New South Wales cane growers. In the letter, among other things, the minister says about the $15,000:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The level of assistance is determined on the impact of the disaster on whole communities and implemented to address the longer term holistic community recovery following a severe natural disaster. The floods in Queensland were very extensive and of a greater magnitude than those experienced in New South Wales and in many cases reached historical record water height levels resulting in extreme flood damage. Therefore the maximum eligible level of support as determined by the national NDRRA was activated in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The letter goes on to outline what is available under the scheme and advises members to contact Mr Rik Whitehead, who is the Assistant Regional Director, North Coast Department of Primary Industries, or the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority for assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really clear what the state minister is saying about that issue of the $15,000 or $25,000 and there have been two natural disasters where the honourable member for Cowper has been in the media saying we should get extra money. One was when the Labor government was in at state level and now there is this one, with the coalition government. It is up to them to ask. That is the way the scheme works and I am not sure the honourable member for Cowper understands that. It is up to them to ask and then it can kick in. The minister has been quoted on that point—and when I say minister, I mean the minister at the federal level. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one issue I discussed with the local cane growers and also with the Rural Assistance Authority, the body at state level that administers all of these programs. I asked the RAA: 'Is is possible to have a collective loan? There are $130,000 concessional grants—is it possible to have that done in a collective way?' I thought it had happened before, but they said it was not possible. In fact it had happened once before, but for a whole range of reasons it did not work out—the money did not get paid back and it was harder to get money back in that system. That was an example of trying to think a bit outside the square.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, the New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-operative Chief Executive Officer, Chris Connors, announced the start of the Grower Loan Planting Assistance Scheme, which is being offered in partnership with the Manildra Group. This scheme will offer plant loan assistance of $1,000 per hectare and will be available to all cane planted this year and next year. This is in my local paper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Star</span>, and it was also in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Examiner</span>. Wayne Rogers, a grower and Chairman of the Richmond River Cane Growers Association, said the initiative was necessary because many people had attempted to plant at least twice last season without success. He said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They had incurred significant cost but had nothing to show for it. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Chief Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  I too rise tonight to speak in support of this motion introduced by my colleague the member for Cowper. I have been quite interested to sit here listening to the contribution from the member for Page. While I do not doubt her concern and empathy for the cane growers on the North Coast, I am afraid that does not help them out of their predicament. The member for Page should note that this motion calls on the government to take action to help the cane growers in northern New South Wales. We have heard a monologue on the member for Page's activities and on letters she has written, but it missed the point: that governments can make this happen. The frustration the cane growers have is that, while they are seeing money squandered elsewhere—in home insulation programs and double priced school halls and a whole range of other things—when something comes up and they really need the funds—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWN" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr COULTON:</span>
                  </a>  I sat silently, Member for Page, during your contribution. When something comes up and we need some decisive action, the money is not there and we get excuses. There is a precedent for this. In 2000, a major rainfall event went through western New South Wales and, at the point of harvest, decimated the wheat crop. The Deputy Speaker would have been a member here at the time and may remember it, as someone involved in agricultural activities. It was devastating—right at the point of harvest, in early December. The then Deputy Prime Minister immediately instigated $60,000 in replanting grants. That was a huge benefit, to not only those farmers but the entire community and Australia as a whole. It was not welfare. It was not benefits. It was not relief payments. It was an investment by the Australian government in its food producers. I would say that the money that went into those farmers in that wet harvest, that replanting grant, would have been repaid in taxation 10 times over in the next couple of years by stopping those farmers going to the wall. And it is not only the farmers that it goes through. A replanting grant—and that is what the Member for Cowper is speaking about—flows through to the agricultural suppliers and the contractors. And having that cash going through helps to keep that core number of people in a community so that you can keep services like education, medicine and all those things going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, too, am disappointed sometimes at the misguided nature of the finance coming out of this government. My electorate also suffered, largely through the floods at Christmas time. Indeed, parts of my electorate, communities and individual farms, were underwater or surrounded by water for two or three months. They received no funds. And now some of them, who had received Centrelink payments, have been asked to return them. There are farmers who had come through eight or nine years of drought who, on the point of harvest, were completely wiped out. I flew over thousands and thousands of acres of unharvested wheat standing in water; that wheat will never be harvested. A replanting grant at that point would have been very useful as well. But it was not forthcoming, and so those communities now are really suffering a cash shortage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I support the member for Cowper's motion here. I am not a cane farmer, but I understand that cane is a very intensive crop. It is very expensive to get established and to plant. And it is a little bit unusual, and different from the crops that I am used to, in that it lasts in a two-year rotation. So when an event wipes out the crop, as this one has, it is very expensive to replant, and the consequences of that flow through for not one but several years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Cowper has every right to come into this place and speak up for the farmers on those issues. And if the member for Page is offended by that, or needs to apologise for the inaction of the government on that, then I am disappointed because I would have thought that it was the role of all in this place to bring to light, to the Australian Parliament, the issues that concern the people they represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am concerned about the priorities of this government when money seems to be bountiful for some things and very tight for others. We speak a lot in this place of food security and climate change and looking after the environment, but here is an opportunity to actually do something practical. And it is not just about funding these farmers to plant a crop. If these farmers are forced off their land, if they have to sell out because they are in a financial bind, then years of expertise—sometimes two or three generations of expertise—is also forced off that land. And that becomes a problem because quite often the land is bought up by corporate investors who have no idea about growing cane. One of the great frustrations in here to me, as someone with an agriculture background, is that, in some quarters, there is no recognition of the skill that farmers have. It is as if they are a tradeable commodity, so that if someone goes off a place and leaves the land we will just replace them with someone else. While many farmers have tertiary degrees, many do not. They gain knowledge and skills from the time they are knee-high and following their father and grandfather around the farm until they finally take control of the farm themselves. That will be the real loss here. It is not just about $15,000 or $25,000 for a replanting grant. The real loss will be if these people decide: 'This is just too hard. We will cash this out. We will sell our cane farm to a developer. They might turn it into a Club Med or an ecovillage or put in some ski boats down by the Clarence. There is good money in that, and we will buy a unit at Yamba and watch the Pacific Ocean.' That is not a bad outcome, except that the expertise of these people, their productivity and the dollars they give and have given over the generations to their community, to the state of New South Wales and to this country will be lost. It is appalling that for just a few dollars—we are not talking about a large number of farmers—their situation could be alleviated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand why the member for Cowper has brought forward this motion. He understands how difficult it is for people in Australia who are running their own business, particularly those who are running an agricultural business, when mother nature throws a double whammy at them and puts them in a place they have not been before financially. When this happens, it is very nice to think that the government of this land can make their future and the future of the community in which they live a priority. </span>

But I do understand the area that the member for Cowper represents because I have lived there longer than he has. So I really do understand the issues surrounding this motion. I suspect, knowing the good people of Cowper the way I do, that if they had a member who really concentrated on honestly putting forward their case they would be a lot happier with the member for Cowper than they would be with him getting up in this parliament and sprouting rhetoric. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might ask: why did the federal government give only $15,000? It was because that is what they were asked to give. They delivered what they were asked to give. Now we have the member for Cowper standing up in this parliament and playing politics by saying, 'The cane growers should have been given $25,000,' when only $15,000 was asked of the federal government. The federal government delivered what they were asked to deliver, and it is very dishonest of the member for Cowper to stand up here and try to make any other argument. What we need to do is separate fact from fiction. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree wholeheartedly with the member for Parkes: every member has the right to stand up here and speak on behalf of the people they represent, but let us do it in a way that is honest and that delivers a quality debate. Let us talk about the issue as it really is, not how we would like it to be. Let us not put things on the record just to score political points; rather, let us see what we can do to really help those cane farmers whose livelihoods have been devastated by these most horrendous conditions. I would attribute the abnormal wet weather to climate change; the member for Cowper would be, I think, denying its existence. We have had many adverse weather events in the area that I come from. I must say that, if the member for Cowper were prepared to support the government in putting a price on carbon so that the 500 biggest polluting industries were held to account for their behaviour, then maybe, just maybe, there would not be as many devastating climate events. I know there has been a very long period of time in the northern part of New South Wales in which there have been very adverse weather conditions and an enormous increase in the rainfall in the area, and this has had a devastating effect on the industry. I would just like to go through a few points in relation to this. Under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, each individual state determines the level of assistance to be paid, subject to caps agreed between the Commonwealth and the state. Why doesn't the member for Cowper argue that? For clean-up and recovery grants for small business and farmers, often referred to as category C grants, the NDRRA clearly provides that the Commonwealth will meet half the cost up to $25,000. This can consist of tier 1 clean-up and recovery grants of up to $5,000, not requiring any proof of damage or expenditure, and tier 2 grants of up to $20,000 for small businesses and primary producers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the member for Cowper is listening to this because it is a very important point. The government has made it clear that it is willing to meet its share of the cost of grants up to the maximum amount. That is not what the member for Cowper tells this parliament. The government has done so following the recent devastating natural disasters in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. It is up to the New South Wales government to determine the level of assistance they believe is to be provided and therefore the level of assistance they should be seeking from the Commonwealth. The member for Cowper should talk to his mates down in Macquarie Street and ask them to support him, not bring it up here in the federal parliament. He needs to get his National Party mates and Premier Barry O'Farrell to support him. As I said earlier, $15,000 was the amount of money that was asked for and $15,000 was what the government delivered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDRRA assistance for the December 2010-January 2011 flooding was made available for 13 local government areas. Included in that were a number that fall within the member for Cowper's electorate, including Bellingen, and the electorates north of Cowper. The money that was given to these local government areas was for personal hardship and distress assistance; certain counter-disaster operations; restoration of essential public assets; concessional loans of up to $130,000 for small businesses and primary producers; concessional loans of up to $25,000 for voluntary and not-for-profit organisations, who really stepped up to the plate at that time and provided assistance and support on the ground for those people who had been adversely affected; transport freight subsidies of up to $15,000 to assist primary producers for the carriage of livestock and fodder; and clean-up and recovery grants of up to $15,000, which the member for Cowper would like to see capped at $25,000, when that was not even asked for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Cowper comes in here, he argues one way, he puts forward a point of view that really is not based on fact and he expects this parliament to take him seriously. Come on. We just cannot take anything that the member for Cowper says seriously when he comes in here and does not tell the true story, does not paint the picture as it is. The government has already responded to Mr Andrew Tickle, the General Secretary of the New South Wales Cane Growers' Association. In his motion I think the member for Cowper refers to the fact that the government has responded, but the motion has been moved. As a National Party member, he voted against the flood levy which would have assisted the people he represents in this parliament. The flood levy would have supported his communities and helped them in the recovery and reconstruction after the devastating floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is up to the New South Wales government. He needs to talk to his mates in Macquarie Street to get it sorted out. He should not come in here trying to blame the federal government for the ineptitude of his colleagues in New South Wales. Just so that the member for Cowper is aware of this the next time he raises an issue such as this, natural disaster management is a state and territory responsibility under the Constitution. Each jurisdiction determines the criteria and the level of assistance provided to individuals and communities affected by natural disasters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am disappointed that the member for Cowper did not even do the basic research need so that he could come in here and honestly debate this legislation. The cane growers of northern New South Wales have my 100 per cent support. I know they have done it tough and they really deserve a member who comes down here and argues effectively for them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  As an economics professor at the Australian National University, one of the people I admired most was Bob Gregory, one of Australia's most creative minds. As well as being a great thinker, Bob is also one of the last people in Australia to contract polio. In an interview with William Coleman he talks about what happened in 1953, when he contracted polio at age 14. Bob said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One day in April I was training for football on a Tuesday and I began to feel stiff and I had to go home. The next day I had to leave school and go to bed. The doctor came and said to Mum, 'He's either got the flu or polio.' Polio was a very bad thing: people died or might be paralysed for life. It attacked lots of children. By Friday my leg wasn't better, so I went to hospital. I felt fine (apart from flu symptoms) and I was optimistic. In bed you don't know you can't walk. It was only after 14 days when they got me out of bed that I discovered that I could not walk. Then I spent nine months in bed. They strap you to an iron frame, your feet are in plaster casts and then your parents take you out of the frame twice a day and exercise you for half an hour. So my father, before and after a hard day's work, had to exercise me. He could move my affected foot but I could not. It remained still. Some days I would say, 'Ooh, I think I can move a toe or I think I can feel something' but I couldn't really. It must have been heartbreaking for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Polio vaccination in Australia started a few years after Bob contracted the disease. But given that he contracted it, he was pretty lucky; he only walks today with a leg brace. Many polio victims require walking sticks or a wheelchair to get around. The motion I move today calls for one of the most significant public health opportunities of our time—the eradication of polio. Over the past quarter century the total number of polio cases worldwide has been reduced by 99 per cent, from 350,000 in 1988 to just 1,349 cases in 2010. Most regions of the world are free of the disease thanks to major immunisation efforts. I particularly commend the efforts of successive Australian governments, working with multilateral non-government organisations, such as Rotary International and other national governments, in wiping out polio in the Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today there are just four countries where polio remains endemic: Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Pakistan. Three of these are Commonwealth nations. All Commonwealth countries, including Australia, have a stake in the elimination of the disease, and the opportunity to end suffering has never been greater. A study published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lancet</span> in 2007 showed that the cost of eradicating polio once and for all is billions of dollars less than the cost of merely keeping infection levels where they are now. The world has seen that infectious disease can be eradicated through targeted immunisation programs. Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300 million to 500 million deaths during the 20th century. The late Australian microbiologist Professor Frank Fenner and his team were instrumental in eradicating smallpox in its last African strongholds in the late 1970s. Professor Fenner described announcing the eradication of smallpox to the UN's World Health Assembly in 1988 as the proudest moment of his long career. By eradicating smallpox we no longer have to vaccinate young children, and as someone who myself received the smallpox vaccine as a young boy, when we were travelling to South-East Asia, I can attest that it was a pretty painful vaccination to receive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In all of human history, only one other infectious disease has ever been completely eradicated. The UN announced the eradication of cattle disease Rinderpest in June this year. Again, we stand on the cusp of a great breakthrough. Endemic polio has been contained to the smallest geographical area in history. Polio surveillance is at an unprecedented high. In 2009 alone, more than 361 million children were immunised in 40 countries as part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Yet the initiative currently faces a funding shortfall of US$590 million for the full implementation of its 2010-12 polio eradication and strategic plan. Failure to meet the financial requirements of eradication is a failure to protect future generations from the debilitating effects of polio paralysis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon the government to support efforts to deliver a polio-free world and to advocate for the inclusion of a strong statement, urging Commonwealth countries to strengthen immunisation systems, including for polio, in the finally communique of the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. In closing, , let me just pay my thanks to Huw Pohlner, an intern in my office this week, who provided me with invaluable assistance in preparing these remarks.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I rise to speak about polio, the impact that the disease has on the lives of those affected and the remarkable efforts of the Gold Coast Polio Support Group, and in particular its convenor, Lyn Glover. Polio is a devastating disease that has historically affected thousands of people worldwide. People of all ages can contract this crippling and potentially fatal disease. However, it mainly affects children under the age of five that have not received appropriate immunisation. The majority of infected people have no symptoms or very mild symptoms which can usually go undetected. These people become carriers of the disease. In contrast, there are other people who can display the common symptoms, including signs of fatigue, a fever, headaches, nausea, stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs. In some cases, infections can lead to irreversible paralysis and this usually occurs in the legs. The virus spreads through the central nervous system and destroys nerves responsible for activating muscles. Without the activation of these muscles, the limbs becomes quite limp. In most extreme cases, paralysis can result in quadriplegia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a remarkable polio survivor living in my electorate of McPherson who contracted paralytic poliomyelitis back in 1958, on her fifth birthday. Lyn Glover was immunised when she was five years old, yet only a few days later she was diagnosed with polio and put into isolation, away from her family and friends. She was placed in a steel cot and could not walk for three years following the diagnosis. The pain and bullying she endured is still strong in her mind today. Lyn, like many others, is concerned that the people who contracted polio many years ago are now experiencing the late effects of polio. Post-polio syndrome has been emerging in sufferers at a later stage in their lives. Like Lyn, there are many other polio survivors suffering unaccustomed fatigue, muscle weakness, muscle and joint pain, loss of mobility, increased sensitivity to the cold, sleeping difficulty and the declining ability to perform basic daily activities. Many polio survivors find it hard to find the right support for these symptoms, as many GPs have limited understanding of the condition and are unable to offer much advice or treatment in this area. This has led to the need for a dedicated polio advocacy service here in Australia. As I mentioned earlier, Lyn Glover is the convener of the Gold Coast Post Polio Support Group that operates in conjunction with the Queensland Spinal Injuries Association. There are 25 members at present and these numbers have been increasing along with the community's awareness. The group meets to discuss with other like-minded individuals the issues they face on a daily basis and through this group they are able to support one another in a truly unique way. As a means to inspire other members, Lyn organises outings for the group and has organised a wellness retreat on the Sunshine Coast for April next year. Lyn was recently recognised for her outstanding contribution to the community when she received a Gold Coast City Council division 11 community service award.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Polio is endemic in Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Pakistan. In these countries the condition of sewerage services and contaminated water contributes to spreading this cruel disease. It is truly heartbreaking to see young children in these poorer countries with little or no mobility or aid to assist them with their daily activities. It is very confronting to see images of these children with crooked limbs and contorted bodies suffering. It is these images that have prompted worldwide attention to push for global eradication. Although we live in a country where we are not confronted with these images on a daily basis, we need to be aware that there are sufferers amongst us who have endured years of pain and isolation. Sadly, there is no cure for polio. There are some treatments aimed at reducing the severity of symptoms. However, the rarity of this condition in our country makes finding these treatments a trying task. I commend the efforts of polio support groups in assisting sufferers through these challenges.</span>

She identified the fact that here in Australia we are now experiencing a wave of people who are suffering from the late effects of polio and that GPs are not familiar with polio and its late effects. It can quite often be passed over fairly easily.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandfather had polio. He died when I was about 10 or 11. I remember that he had callipers on his legs, which restricted the way he could get around. I also know that the mother of the member for Ballarat suffered from polio. It really was endemic here in Australia. People of my age were the first generation in this country that did not have to fear contracting polio. I remember the vaccinations first started coming out when I was in school. We lined up, were given the jab and that was the start of the eradication of polio in this country. The member for Fraser is saying that it should not finish with what is happening here in Australia. We should work to see polio eradicated globally. We cannot be comfortable in the knowledge that polio is not prevalent in our society here in Australia until it has been eradicated globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a crippling and potentially fatal infectious disease. Many people lost their lives or had their lives changed irreparably because they contracted polio. It is highly infectious and is caused by a virus. Polio is one of a limited number of diseases that only affect humans. A safe, effective and inexpensive vaccine exists that will lead to eradication. Immunity is lifelong and the virus can only survive for a very short period of time. Studies of the cost-effectiveness of polio eradication have demonstrated that it is feasible to work to control and eradicate it because it is much more cost effective to make sure that polio no longer is a disease that can affect anyone throughout the world. Given the current rates of routine immunisation and the relative weakness of the health systems in many parts of the world's countries like those identified in the motion by the member for Fraser—Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Pakistan—and given that their health systems are not as robust as our health system, it makes it all the more important for us as a nation to support those countries. The global project, the end of polio campaign, was launched on 25 July. It is a 100-day campaign. It is timed to coincide with the lead-up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth between 28 and 30 October. It is a campaign that all Australians should get behind because the eradication of this debilitating disease, polio, is imperative not only for Australia but globally. I would also like to acknowledge the fine work that is being done by non-government organisations. Rotary International are mentioned in this particular motion by the member for Fraser. I would like to acknowledge the work that they have done in contributing to the eradication of polio.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I rise tonight to support this motion. Historically, polio has been the world's greatest cause of disability and still today there is no cure. The best protection is prevention. Polio is a debilitating disease which can cause paralysis within hours, paralysis which is almost always irreversible. In severe cases the disease attaches to the motor neurons of the brain stem, which causes breathing difficulty and can lead to death. In the next 40 years more than 10 million children will be paralysed if the world does not capitalise on its US$5 billion global investment in eradication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1985 Rotary International, a wonderful organisation, launched PolioPlus, a program which has been described as the most ambitious undertaking in Rotary's history. Through PolioPlus Rotary has raised more than US$800 million worldwide and is currently working to raise an additional US$200 million towards a US$355 million challenge grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. I acknowledge the work in my electorate of Riverina of all the Rotary clubs within District 9700, which have worked hard to raise money for this most worthwhile cause. Rotary has also led the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, in conjunction with the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and the US Centers for Disease Control. Since 1985, more than two billion children have been immunized through this initiative. Two billion children have been given a great start against the possibility of contracting polio. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative objectives are to interrupt transmission of the wild polio virus as soon as possible, to achieve certification of global polio eradication and to contribute to health systems development and strengthening routine immunisation and surveillance for communicable diseases in a systematic way. With the vaccinations offered through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, more than five million people who would otherwise have been paralysed are walking today because they have been immunised. This shows the effectiveness of the immunisation and how important it is that the initiative's work continues. The PolioPlus program is recognised internationally for its use of public-private cooperation in pursuit of a humanitarian goal. I wish to extend my thanks to Rotary for their wonderful work in this area. In 2008 Dr Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation, announced that polio eradication was the organisation's top priority. She stated: </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As an international community, we have few opportunities to do something that is unquestionably good for every country and every child, in perpetuity. Polio eradication is one of these opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the WHO's ongoing work in 2009 more than 361 million children were immunised in 40 countries during 273 supplementary immunisation activities. In 2010 only four countries in the world remained polio-endemic, down from more than 125 countries in 1988. These countries are Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. This is a great achievement, but work must continue to help vaccinate children, particularly in these polio-prone countries. It is also heartening to learn that as of 12 August 2011 Kazakhstan has passed 12 months with no reported polio cases. However, it takes only one child to remain infected and children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio. In 2009-10, 23 previously polio-free countries were reinfected due to imports of the virus. This is a disease we must remain constantly vigilant against, and I urge everyone who can do anything to eradicate polio to do what they can to prevent this disease from spreading and to ensure that immunisation prevents any children or adults from becoming infected in the future.</span>

I also commend the efforts of the member for Fraser in bringing this matter to the attention of this place and for raising its profile, along with the efforts of so many others who I know are campaigning vigorously on such an important issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that polio mainly affects children under the age of five and that one in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. This has profound effects on children in the developing world; it has profound effects on their families and their communities and the opportunities that are available to those children in already difficult circumstances would be made substantially more difficult. Among those paralysed, five per cent to 10 per cent may die when their breathing muscles become immobilised. The incidence of polio, despite these rather troubling features of the disease, has decreased by over 99 per cent since 1988. It has gone from an estimated 350,000 cases worldwide at that time to just over 1,600 reported cases in 2009. That reduction really is a direct result of the global effort to eradicate the disease and the vigilance of so many people who have campaigned steadfastly in relation to it. I commend successive Australian governments for their roles in that global effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that at the 41st World Health Assembly in 1988, which then consisted of delegates from around 160 member states, a resolution was adopted for the worldwide eradication of polio. It marked at that time the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which was spearheaded by the World Health Organisation, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF. As a result, in 1994 the WHO was able to declare that the 36 countries that make up the region of the Americas were polio-free. In 2000 the western Pacific region of 37 countries was also declared free from the polio virus and the European region of 51 countries received polio-free status in June 2002. In 2009 more than 361 million children were immunised against the disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010 only four countries in the world remained polio-endemic, down from more than 125 in 1988, demonstrating the success of vigilant campaigning on such a significant health issue. Those remaining countries are Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. Interestingly, three of those countries are Commonwealth nations. We know that persistent pockets of polio transmission remain in northern India, northern Nigeria and the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are the current focus of polio eradication initiatives. In addition to this polio has re-established itself in four other countries: Angola, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, it is suspected, in Sudan. A number of other countries we know experienced outbreaks in 2010 as a result of the virus being imported into those countries. As long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio. I recognise that the overall success of eradicating polio worldwide hinges on closing a substantial funding gap to finance the next steps of the global eradication initiative. I am very pleased that Australia has committed to investing an additional $140 million from 2011 to 2013 to support the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. GAVI is an innovative public-private international fund that increases access to vaccines and immunisation against preventable diseases in some of the world's poorest countries. One of these preventable diseases is polio. I also know that the Global Poverty Project is running a grassroots campaign under the banner of 'The end of polio' and has initiated a petition in support of global polio eradication efforts. I met with them recently to discuss that. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to have people within my own community with an interest in this issue. Indeed, at a local community forum I held recently in my electorate volunteers from the Global Poverty Project gave a particularly pertinent presentation on how to become more active in the types of campaigns that they run on issues such as this. I am pleased to be able support their work in that way. I also know that Rotary, including Rotary groups within my own electorate, have taken a keen interest in poverty alleviation and improving the circumstances of those in developing nations, and I lend my support to their cause. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  Polio is historically a devastating disease, one of the most dreaded childhood illnesses in human history. Highly contagious, polio caused widespread paralysis and death in Europe and the United States of America during the 19th and 20th centuries. Affecting the central nervous system, polio can cause deformities, muscle weaknesses and flaccid paralysis. It is as debilitating as it was endemic throughout the early decades of the 1900s, causing the great race to find a vaccine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the medical initiatives that we take for granted in the Western world today were implemented out of necessity for fighting the seriousness of polio epidemics. Intensive care units had their origins in fighting polio. Before the 1950s, hospitals had little capacity for respiratory assistance for patients and the first respiratory centre opened to treat severe cases of polio, leading to the first intensive care unit opening in Copenhagen in 1953. As we all know today, intensive care units are integral parts of our hospital systems, saving countless lives every year. Further, the roots of medical philanthropy began during the polio epidemics. Grassroots fundraising was hardly heard of before these outbreaks of polio. Rehabilitation programs were introduced to help survivors and polio survivor support groups have been instrumental in advocating for disability rights. Clearly, it is a disease which has changed not only the lives of those affected and their families but also our entire Western culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A vaccine was developed in the 1950s and has reduced polio cases in the Western world from hundreds of thousands every year to just handfuls. Given that in 1952, 58,000 cases of polio were reported in the United States alone, this vaccine was a serious and welcome breakthrough. In 1988, this vaccine was instrumental in the global campaign to eradicate polio led by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and Rotary International. These organisations, collaborating with governments and local communities around the world, have seen this campaign help reduce polio cases from 350,000 reported in 1988 to just 1,349 in 2010. Additionally, polio endemic countries have been reduced from 125 to just four. These figures mean that polio has been reduced by 99 per cent since 1988. It is now a disease of which young people in Western nations are almost unaware. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes would not have happened if Rotary International and its partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative had not taken up the cause. They have worked relentlessly for the past 23 years to fight polio and, as the figures previously mentioned indicate, they are getting very close to achieving their goal. Rotary International's 1.2 million volunteers took up the charge in 1985, spearheading the immunisation effort against polio before it became a coordinated campaign in 1988. They understood that this global disease would need a global effort if it was to be defeated. With over 33,000 clubs spread across 200 countries, Rotarians are well placed to engage with local governments and communities to ensure that polio eradication is at the top of everyone's agenda. Financially Rotary itself has contributed over $900 million to the polio eradication effort as well as their members volunteering their own time and resources to reach over two billion children with the oral polio vaccine. Rotary's dedication to this cause has been unwavering, with the organisation currently aiming to match the $355 million donation made by Bill and Melinda Gates towards the eradication of polio. This challenge is critical as the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has a funding gap of just over half a billion dollars. Yes, they are only half a billion dollars away from eradicating that last one per cent of polio cases—miniscule compared to the money wasted by NBN Co. on the NBN.</span>

                  </a>  Very accurate though. As Rotary says, 'that final one per cent are the most difficult and expensive to prevent. Challenges include geographic isolation, worker fatigue, armed conflict, and cultural barriers,' making this job that much harder. However, as this motion highlights, we have an opportunity to ensure that polio eradication in other parts of the world is not forgotten, as has been possible for young people in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion which concerns early childhood education. I am the mover of this particular motion. This is an important motion that I hope will get the full support of this parliament. It is so important because it concerns the viability of three-year-old kindergartens in Victoria. In short, if we do not get the flexibility that is called for in this motion, then many three-year-old kindergartens in Victoria will close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to explain the origins of this pending crisis, how it is manifesting itself and the actions that we are proposing the government take to address the crisis. The crisis in three-year-old kinders and also four-year-old kinders in rural areas had its origins a few years ago when the federal Labor government decided that it wanted to get involved in preschool education. It introduced what is called the Universal Access policy, which mandated that by 2013 every child in the year before they started school, which is typically four-year-olds, must have 15 hours per week of preschool education and, further, that this preschool education must be delivered by university trained teachers. The government at the time made a commitment of $955 million over five years to assist with the implementation of this policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the policy articulated, agreements were then struck with various state and territory governments to administer the universal access policy. However, while the sentiments expressed in the policy were reasonable ones—that is, to deliver good preschool education to preschoolers—the actual policy itself has not been properly thought through. Unfortunately, like many of this government's policies, the full consequences of the implementation were not properly considered before the final decision was made. In this instance, the Universal Access policy for four-year-olds is going to have a drastic impact on three-year-old kinder programs, particularly those in Victoria. In Victoria, we have the largest three-year-old kinder program: about 25 per cent of all three-year-olds attend three-year-old kinder. It is the most comprehensive program in Australia. These three-year-old kinders receive no government funding. They are often managed by parent controlled committees and they provide good introductory education for three-year-olds for about five hours per week for about 40 weeks a year. These three-year-old kinders typically use the same facilities and often the same staff as the four-year-old kinder programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where the problems arise. With the implementation of the Universal Access policy, hours for four-year-old kinders will be increased by about 50 per cent. Typically at the moment they offer about 10 to 11 hours per week for four-year-olds. So the consequences of increasing the four-year-old kinder program by 50 per cent is that it will squeeze out the three-year-old kinder programs to the extent that many of them will not survive unless something changes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Four problems arise from the Universal Access policy in this regard. Firstly, simply a lack of space because, as I mentioned beforehand, the three-year-old programs are often run at the same location as the four-year-old programs. They have managed to combine themselves in a sequential manner offered in the same facilities. Now, if you increase by 50 per cent the four-year-old programs, then there are simply not enough hours in the day during a school hour time frame to then run a number of three-year-old programs concurrently at the same location.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second problem is insufficient staff. There is already a shortage of university qualified staff for preschools, as you may already know, and with the four-year-old programs needing 50 per cent more staff by 2013, again three-year-old programs are going to find it very difficult to find staff to manage their programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the structure of 15 hours for four-year-olds will not necessarily fit neatly within the employment awards presently for kindergarten teachers, because under the Early Childhood Teachers and Assistants Award, a full-time person will not be able to run two sessions of four-year-old kinders. This is because the award specifies that they must have 30 minutes of non-teaching for every one hour of teaching and it also specifies a maximum of 38 hours per week. You can see, if you do the mathematics there, a single person will not be able to run two 15-hour sessions under the existing award. So again, we are going create all sorts of staffing problems in the four-year-old programs as well as the three-year-old programs due to this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the fourth problem which arises from the Universal Access policy is that some four-year-old programs may be put in jeopardy in rural areas. That is simply because many kindergarten teachers will frequently run a program in one small kinder in one location and another one in another location and they simply will not be able to do both if the hours are increased, and so that puts some four-year-old programs also at risk and I imagine that Dan Tehan, the member for Wannon, will have something to say about that as the seconder of this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kindergartens in my community have said that they will have to close their three-year-old programs if something does not happen to rectify these problems. Templeton Orchards three-year-old preschool in Wantirna in my electorate is one such example. Lelania Currie, the vice-president of the kinder, has said publicly that they will have to close if this goes ahead by 2013. They presently cater for about 23 families each year. Other kinders have said similar things. They have said that if there is no flexibility then three-year-old kinders will simply have to shut their doors. The Municipal Association of Victoria has said that there will be a crisis by 2013 under this policy. They have pointed out that four-year-old programs are already bursting at the seams due to a mini baby boom which is going on across Victoria, and indeed across Australia, and that this Universal Access policy will exacerbate it. The Prime Minister herself has been advised that her electorate is one of the most at-risk regions for children to miss out. This will turn into a very significant crisis by 2013 and impact thousands of young families if this mess is not fixed up. The clock is ticking. We need to act and we need to act quickly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me move on to what should be done to fix this. The first point I would make is that it is not too late. The policy under the current law is that it needs to be implemented by 2013. Kinders are starting to enrol already for that year and there is still some time, but we do not have a lot of time. The second point I would make is that the key principle required is flexibility. This government has a tendency to want to mandate things from the top down and, in this instance, they have come down and mandated very heavily that every single four-year-old kinder program across the country must have 15 hours. What we are suggesting, through this motion, is that the government just allows some flexibility for the kindergartens to implement their policy at their own pace and according to their own infrastructure capacity and according to their own staffing that they have available. So point 8 in the motion, which is the key point, calls on the government to provide flexibility for the kindergarten operators to deliver kindergarten services according to the needs of their own communities and in line with local infrastructure and staffing capacity and further, at the very least, provide flexibility on the start date for the implementation of the Universal Access policy. It is a reasonably straightforward motion. It should be a reasonably straightforward thing for Minister Garrett to hopefully accept.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Garrett has considered this in the past and he has said no to date. He has said it is all up to the state governments. Well, can I just put on the record here that it is not just up to the state governments in this instance because there is a COAG contractual arrangement here. The Victorian state government is willing to examine it and look at providing flexibility, but we need Minister Garrett and the Gillard government to come to the table to address this problem also.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If flexibility is indeed provided and we can properly look at how we are going to implement this going forward, we also would be able to look at other things as well. There is a strong group called the Community Choice for Preschools Group which is calling for the 15 hours of funding to be spread across the two years and possibly five hours for three-year-olds and 10 hours for four-year-olds. Again, I think that is a worthy idea that should be considered, but can only be done if Minister Garrett is prepared to accept our motion to look at providing flexibilities for kinders so that they can implement things according to their own wishes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the motion to the House and I hope that it will receive support across the chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HW8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SYMON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  I rise to speak against this motion moved by the Member for Aston. In 2008 the federal Labor government made a historic commitment to this nation's early childhood sector, and that is a sector that in the past has not received funding from a federal government. In a national agreement signed between the federal government and every state and territory government, the universal access obligation for the provision of preschool or kindergarten programs was expanded—a great thing. This increased the universal access obligation from 10 hours per week to 15 hours per week for 40 weeks of kindergarten or preschool education in the year before school, and that is for every child in Australia. This program continues on as an ambitious and important reform that will increase investment in our children and it is a program that grows by the year with more money each year going from the federal government to the states to do the work that is needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research from around the world shows that quality early childhood education benefits all children and that children from disadvantaged backgrounds gain particular benefit if they attend kindergarten. Research also shows that benefits include improved cognitive functioning and social skills and thereby improved school readiness. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated positive effects on school completion, further education participation, employment outcomes, earnings and general social wellbeing. That is why the federal Labor government acted to expand the amount of kindergarten education a child will receive. A recent government report of 2011 suggests that around 30 per cent of all Australian children are missing out on early childhood education in the year before schooling and, although Victoria has a much higher percentage, I know the difference between the states is particularly marked. Queensland has a far, far lower participation rate than Victoria. I believe it is somewhere around about that low 30 per cent and it has got a long way to go. Victoria historically has had a very high participation rate in four-year-old kinder or equivalent and that is a good thing, and I certainly hope that continues but obviously for a larger amount of hours each week. Boosting the federal government's investment in the early years of learning is crucial to Australia's long-term economic, social and physical health for the reasons I just previously went through. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a long term and challenging reform. More kindergarten teachers will have to be trained and recruited and more money will also need to be expended to expand the buildings and cater for more children at kinder for longer periods of time. When the federal Labor government made this commitment, it was clear that delivering on this would demand significant investment and a suitably long lead time to assist providers to implement the additional hours of teaching. All up, the federal government is delivering over $900 million over five years to all the states and territories through to 2012-13 to implement the universal access commitment. As I said, this is the first time the federal government has substantially funded early childhood education, and that is a great result. The share of this national funding going to Victorian kindergartens and preschools over the full five years is $210,626,000. That is a great investment from when previously there was almost nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that Victoria has already received about $71 million of this funding with a further $29½ million due in early December. I took the liberty of going through the original COAG agreement to find the payment schedule and to see when the money does come across. I find it interesting that even though the Commonwealth has put more money in, the state government has stood back or has been able to point the finger elsewhere and say, 'But it is not us. We need more and even though we have money and it is coming in, it is not enough.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although Victoria does have a particularly good program of three-year-old kinders, in many cases they have always operated as an adjunct to four-year-old kinders and, I would say, with money from the Commonwealth and investment from the state there should be enough to go around. It does not seem to be the case at the moment. I find that quite frustrating because I do not know where this federal funding is going to in Victoria. I cannot go out into my electorate and see where it is going as there is no badging, no signage, no acknowledgment of any federal money anywhere with kindergarten programs, whether they be for three- or four- or any years old. That is a particular issue when it comes to accountability of the state in spending federal money. It is something that every member in this place should also be well aware of. If we do the hard work here and collect money, pass bills and then expend money, if that is passed over to the states then we should know what we are getting for our dollars. The general public should have a right to know and demand that information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous state Labor government announced and allocated $4.6 million for use in expanding some kindergartens across the state. It is expected that all these capital works will be completed by 2012. But as part of its commitment to support the expansion of universal access, the previous Victorian government—a Labor government—increased funding to the sector. Indeed, in 2010 the state Labor government at the time committed to spend more than $82.6 million over the next five years to support the expansion of places, $63 million of which would have been spent boosting state government funded kindergarten places from 62,500 to 66,090. I am sure that more are needed but it is always good to start on a problem rather than wait until it is overwhelming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emma King, the CEO of Kindergarten Parents Victoria applauded the previous Labor government's investment in the early years education. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This comprehensive package will help ensure that all Victorian children have access to a quality kindergarten program in the year before school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, after all this investment by Labor state and federal governments, what does the Victorian Liberal state government do? In the first budget of the Baillieu Liberal government there were substantial cuts, not directly to core funding but to programs around core funding to kindergartens and pre-schools, ending the free internet service provided to the state's 1,800 community-run kindergartens. The state government IT support for these community kindergartens is important and includes internet connectivity, help desk and remote technology assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also cuts to occasional childcare services out of 220 neighbourhood houses across the state. That leaves a gap in the provision of other childhood services in Victoria. Other cuts were made to the Young Readers program, which distributed free books to children on their second birthday and also cut the books-for-babies services. The $2.1 million program distributed 70,000 books and a further 70,000 reading-to-baby manuals over four years. The loss of the Young Readers Program dismayed picture book author Jeanette Rowe, who was the program's ambassador last year. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It invited mothers  to start with their children at a very early age to create that habit of reading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The literacy sessions run by maternal and child health nurses 'weren't just about reading' said Lisa Fitzpatrick, the state secretary of the Australian Nurses Federation. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It was an opportunity to assess a child's vision and their hearing. It wasn't just handing out a book.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be underlined that, in a period when it has been estimated by the Municipal of Association of Victoria that Victoria will need an additional 400 kindergarten teachers, the state government ended its funding of retraining for early childhood workers required to upgrade their qualifications. I find it disappointing that the Liberal Party have not taken full advantage in expanding the number of hours in kindergarten education for Victorian preschoolers. It is estimated by research that every dollar spent on early childhood education gives the community a gain of $3 in return. Australia has been one of the lowest spenders on early-years education, and this reform is turning that around, with federal funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The original timetable for implementation included an extended five-year period, agreed to by the federal government and all the states and territories at COAG. The federal government, after discussions with state and territory governments, agreed to fund additional training of kindergarten teachers and the early-childhood workforce, with $126 million over four years, to train and retrain the professional early-childhood education and care workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this really comes down to is: where is the Commonwealth's money? Where is our investment? Fifty-nine million dollars went this year to Victoria, and yet what we hear from the member for Aston is, 'Oh, but there's no money for places.' Well, I say that there is money for places, and I say there is more money coming from the Commonwealth next year. But I say to everyone in this House that we, the members of parliament, should know where this federal money is going. I think it is only right and proper. And as long as there are groups out there calling for more, it is always worth remembering what we do with what we already have.</span>

We were going to see an end to the blame game in 2007. We were going to have the states and the Commonwealth cooperating together. Now we have an issue—an issue of bungling and mismanagement. And what is the response of the government? 'We are going to blame the states. We're back to the blame game. We'll throw financial figures around: $900 million we're giving to this, $210 million we're giving to that, to try and put a huge smokescreen up, to get around the issue.' Yet it is a very simple and commonsense issue. It is an issue on which the government, if it could take a step back, could say, 'We can stop three-year-old kindergarten programs and four-year-old kindergartens closing in country areas.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us hear from a couple of the practitioners. I am going to quote the North Hamilton Kindergarten director, Chris Wildgoose, who said that the 15 hours could result in reduced hours for three-year-old sessions. I will quote her directly, from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamilton Spectator </span>of 26 May:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"I think it's a good thing for children to have that much kindergarten but it's just a challenge to fit it into the timetable with the three year-old groups and the playgroup as well," she said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Our committee hasn't really made a decision about how the timetable will look. It's possible our three year-old sessions will be cut back to two hours."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ms Wildgoose said that currently parents had the option of extra kindergarten hours for their four year-olds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"The Government has mandated that this year children do 10 and three quarter hours, so that's the basic level," she said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"We've got another session on top of that, so parents can choose if they want to do the extra hours."</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ms Wildgoose said they had the option of introducing the 15-hour weeks next year but were still unsure if that would go ahead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Ms Wildgoose would like is the ability to say, 'Maybe we will have the flexibility to bring this in over three, four or five years, so that it can suit the needs of the individual kindergarten.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to quote Sarah Millear, quoted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ararat Advertiser</span> of 26 November 2010. The Willaura kindergarten wrote to the government on this issue, so they have had plenty of warning. What did she have to say? She said that the government's universal access to childcare reforms would seriously strain the over-stretched community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"The further increase in 2013 will leave us with an insurmountable fundraising requirement, forcing us to seriously consider closing the centre unless government funding is made available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"If the Willaura Kindergarten is forced to close, there would inevitably be a drop in enrolments for the local primary school. The community playgroup and maternal and child healthcare centre, which rely on the support of the kindergarten community, would have to look [at] their long-term viability as well. Three key services could be lost and the long-term future of the school put at risk."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this motion is about. We are going to see three-year-old kindergarten programs close, we are going to see four-year-old kindergarten providers in country areas potentially close. All we need to see is a tiny bit of flexibility from the government. As the motion clearly states, what I and the member for Aston are calling on is for the government to provide flexibility for kindergarten operators to deliver kindergarten services according to the needs of their own communities and in line with local infrastructure and staffing capacity, or at the very least provide flexibility on the start date for the implementation of universal access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all agree with the concept that we should move to 15 hours universal access. What we do not agree on is how we should go about it. Should we mandate from Canberra that you have to do a compulsory 15 hours by 2013? When individual circumstances are not suited by mandating 15 hours, why can't you say, 'All right, in your particular circumstances you can keep it at 10 or 11 hours.' If you are the Willaura kindergarten and you are forced to close, there would inevitable be a drop in enrolments to the local primary school, the community playgroup, and the maternal and child healthcare centre, which rely on the support of the kindergarten community, would have to look at their long-term viability as well. Three key services could be lost and the long-term future of the school put at risk. That is quite clear. Given that, why would you not allow them to say, 'Yes, look, you aspire for 15, but your circumstances at the moment mean that if you have to mandate it and you have to introduce it by 2013, you are going to lose in that community all those services.' Why would you not say, 'Leave it at 10. Then when you can afford it, then more to 15.' Why do we have to mandate from Canberra, which is going to cause this hardship for the township of Willaura? The same thing is going to happen in my electorate, in the township of Cavendish. Dunkeld potentially can be left without a kindergarten teacher, all because this government has to mandate, has to be prescriptive and will not let an individual circumstance dictate how a kindergarten should run. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard from the member for Aston the impact it is going to have on three-year-old programs in urban areas. Devastating. In country areas it is going to have a broad impact on whole communities. Kindergartens closing. Schools, in the future, closing. And all the services that go with it, especially your maternal primary healthcare, being threatened. All because you will not provide a tiny bit of flexibility. You want to mandate from Canberra, from here, without having thought of what the consequences on the ground would be. I see the member for Corangamite here. I am sure there are kindergartens in his community which will be suffering as a result of this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to stop. They have been warned. They were written to by the Willaura kindergarten in 2010 raising this issue. So they knew about it. So why has the minister not acted? What we have put here, in this motion, is a very sensible, positive approach to fixing this problem. It is not a problem that is saying the government has got it completely wrong. We are saying, 'Yes, aspire to 15 hours, but do it in a way where kindergartens can adapt to it in their own individual circumstances.' Here is a positive response to an issue that needs to be fixed, needs to be addressed. The government continues to harp about negativity. Here is a positive response to a problem which they have created because they have not thought through the issue. Why not look at it? Look at it. Read what we are calling on. Provide flexibility. It is not too difficult. Instead of saying, 'We know best—this is how it will be. Canberra on high: this is how you should act,' why not say: 'Generally this is what we would like, but when your individual circumstances are different then, sure, you can have some flexibility. If you want to do 11 hours of teaching next year and then move to 12 and then to 13 and by 2018 get to 15 hours, we are fine by that'? We would prefer that to communities having the guts ripped out of them, which is what this motion has the potential to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I call on the government. I call on the minister. I have written to the minister on this issue. The Willaura kindergarten has written to him. The Dunkeld and Cavendish kindergartens have written to him. They have all stated their case. It is not necessary to change the whole policy. Just show flexibility—a tiny bit of flexibility—in how you are going about doing it. That will save kindergartens, it will save three-year-old programs and it will potentially save communities. I call on all members of the government to have a look at this motion. It is a good motion; it is a common-sense motion. An urban representative and a country representative are saying: this is going to cause problems.  Fix the mess. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:06</span>):  I have to say at the outset that I am going to have to do something slightly controversial. It really does pain me to do it but I am going to have to do it, and that is to say congratulations to members of the coalition from Victoria. You won the last election in Victoria. I think it is important to remind them of that because so regularly these days they forget; they forget that they are out of opposition in Victoria. They forget that they actually have their hands on the purse strings now. They forget that they can take out the chequebook and make financial commitments to things that they profess so heartily to be committed to. I congratulate them most heartily on having that level of responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might have expected coalition members to put up a motion like this when they were in opposition in the state of Victoria, when they did not have their hands on the state coffers, when they did not have responsibility for the policy direction of the state government. I could understand that. Have a crack at the federal and state governments. Have a crack at them with no responsibility for implementing your own agenda. But the circumstances have changed, as much as it seems to have passed by Victorian members of the coalition and their state counterparts. What I cannot understand is why coalition MPs from Victoria would choose to raise these concerns when their own Victorian coalition government has the means to commit funding to the kindergartens which they profess to be concerned about.</span>

                  </a>  If those members opposite who are interjecting would allow me to continue with my words, I will address their concerns in due course. The facts are that all state and territory governments, not just the federal government, agreed through COAG to provide access to kindergarten for all children by 2013. For the first time, as my colleague from Deakin mentioned earlier on, the Australian government is funding early childhood education. The federal government has committed over $955 million over five years to support the states and territories to enable them to achieve the goals which they have each committed to. Apparently these are mere details for those opposite, who choose not to take an interest in the substantial funding commitment which their government failed to put in place. The federal government has committed $955 million to achieve the goals which all the states and territories committed to under the National Partnership Agreement on Early Childhood Education. So far as flexibility is concerned, the manner in which the Victorian government meets the universal access commitment it signed up to is entirely up to it. That is the nature of the national partnership agreement. The Victorian government is responsible for implementing universal access, supported by the very significant financial contribution of the Commonwealth government. Indeed, the Victorian education department's own website reflects this. Under the heading 'Early Childhood Education National Partnership' and the subheading 'Funding' it notes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has committed $970 million nationally over five years for this reform, including $210.6 million for Victoria. The Department is responsible for leading implementation of universal access to 15 hours of kindergarten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unequivocally, the Victorian education department has recognised quite publicly the responsibility of the Victorian coalition government for leading implementation. If our coalition colleagues here do not consider their own state colleagues to be up to that task then they are also admitting that the coalition simply is not up for governing the state of Victoria—a matter which so many of us are very happy to conclude—</span>

But the opposition would have anyone who will listen believe that its hands are tied. We are seeing the same kind of sham here.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On issues around the implementation of universal access, we know that Victoria already achieves the universal access target of 95 per cent of enrolments and, overall, Victoria is one of the jurisdictions closest to achieving the main goals of the national partnership agreement, no doubt due to the current government's predecessor's efforts. According to the state government's annual report, under the National Partnership Agreement on Early Childhood Education in 2009 the average weekly hours provided by standalone kindergartens in Victoria was 11.8 hours and, when provision in long day care is included, that figure is 14.6 hours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with other state and territory governments, Victoria remains responsible for ensuring the delivery of kindergarten programs, including its approach to achieving universal access by 2013. In agreeing to the universal access commitment, the impact on other programs, including kindergarten for three-year-olds, was considered. Indeed, it was noted in the bilateral agreement with the Victorian government. That is one of the reasons why a five-year lead time for implementation was allowed, so that kindergarten providers have time to adjust their services so that they can deliver on the universal access commitment. As the state government is responsible for ensuring the provision of kindergarten services, it is open to the Victorian government to make greater funding contributions to kindergarten services for three-year-olds if it so wishes. I would suggest again that members make their remarks to their Victorian state colleagues.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Victoria already meets the 95 per cent enrolment benchmark for four-year-olds, it provides 10 hours free through state subsidy and it has a robust system of delivery through local government, placing it well ahead of many other jurisdictions in terms of reaching the goals of universal access commitment. The federal government has provided a significant amount of funding. It has kick-started this initiative and it really is up to my Victorian coalition colleagues to stop bleating about that kind of commitment and start working with their Victorian colleagues. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:17</span>):  This is a very important motion and I do commend the member for Aston and also the member for Wannon for putting forward what I believe is a very common-sense proposal. I do acknowledge from the outset that these are very reasonable members of parliament. They have come here in good faith trying to solve a problem in their community and what concerns me is those opposite automatically go straight to the barricades. This is so typical of this government: they go straight to the barricades and take a partisan position. This is a very reasonable motion which seeks to provide flexibility and some common-sense solutions to what is an impending disaster for this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government was warned in the early days in relation to home insulation, it was warned in the early days in relation to the Building the Education Revolution scheme, it was warned in the early days of the green loan assessment scheme—and we all know what happened to each and every one of those programs. They were monumental disasters on the ground. Now we have two very reasonable members of parliament—one from a metropolitan area and one from a regional area—coming into this place and sounding the warning bells. I hope the minister is listening more closely than those opposite right now. This is an issue which has the potential to be disastrous on the ground in many communities, particularly when we are talking about young people and their futures in our communities right across regional areas—which I am more interested in, I must admit—and also the metropolitan areas that the member for Aston referred to. There are major problems brewing across Victoria in relation to this universal access issue and the effort to try to provide 15 hours by 2013. I said at the outset that that is the bad news. There is a crisis brewing. It has the potential to be an enormous mess, but the good news is there is still time to try to fix this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite can block their ears and go straight to the barricades like we heard today. The leader of business on the government side in the chamber referred to the protesters out the front today as being the 'convoy of no consequence'. They can go down that path where they just put their fingers in their ears and ignore the concerns of everyday Australians or they can actually listen to the concerns being put forward by Australians. The benefits of early childhood education programs are well understood I believe by members on both sides of the House. I do not think there is any question about that at all. I think everyone understands the importance of early childhood education programs. I do believe the 15-hours-per-week issue is well intended. I do believe that the government was heading down the path of trying to provide good early childhood education right across Australia. I give the government credit for its good intentions. But, like so many of the Rudd government's and the Gillard government's good intentions, the delivery is a cause for concern.</span>

                  </a>  It is interesting that the member for Wakefield intervenes. The member for Wakefield often interjects. He interjects when I make 90 second statements in the House, but he never actually shows the spine to stand up for his community. He never actually stands up on issues like the carbon tax or on this issue, where there is genuine concern in communities across Australia. He never stands up and says to the government, 'We have got a problem, Minister.' Those opposite can interject as much as they like when I am making a speech, but do they stand up to their own ministers and say, 'Minister, we have a problem'? You have not got the guts to do that in the House on issues like the carbon tax or on the issue of early childhood education.</span>

He talked about flexibility being critical and I think that is an aspect that our national government needs to understand more. The one-size-fits-all model driven by this government has been a disaster on many occasions across several programs. There are several programs—I referred to a couple earlier—where a national agenda fell flat on the ground right across Australia because we went for a one-size-fits-all model. I fear that this program is heading down the same path. On those points I congratulate the member for Aston for his contribution and for the motion he brought to the House. I also congratulate the member for Wannon for his contribution. He raised very reasonable concerns on behalf of this community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed that the member for La Trobe referred to another aspect of early childhood education—the Take a Break occasional care program. Let us get this right: to save a miserable $12.6 million over four years this Labor government has withdrawn support for an occasional care program across regional areas which provides a vital service in each of our electorates, but it can still find $12 million for a carbon tax TV advertising campaign. So it cannot fund occasional child care in regional communities but it can fund propaganda campaigns on the carbon tax. If those opposite want to have a reasonable debate on issues of great significance to the Australian people, start treating members on this side with respect when they raise reasonable and legitimate issues. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The last Brumby government had in their forward estimates $109 million for the provision of kindergartens. That is what the last Brumby budget said. Guess what the first Baillieu government budget said with respect to kindergartens? It said $9 million. The Baillieu government in their first budget cut $100 million out of the kindergarten budget in Victoria.

                  </a>  No, I am not. The Gillard government is very proud and very pleased to have entered into a COAG agreement with all of the states and territories to lift the provision of kindergarten for four-year-olds. That is an important initiative. It is an initiative that will give all Australian kids the best opportunity to access schooling in the following year. The universal agreement was entered into with all of the states and territories and it led to a very substantial amount of money flowing to those states and territories to deliver 15 hours of kindergarten for four-year-olds. That is something that I am very pleased about. I actually, just this last week gone, read in the local newspaper that Minister Wendy Lovell, the state Minister for Children and Early Childhood, was at the Inverleigh Kindergarten within my electorate. I read with some interest that she was opening a new kindergarten room within that facility to provide for the Inverleigh community. I thought I might do a bit of a Google search to see where that money had come from and—surprise, surprise!—I found a press release by John Brumby, the then Premier of Victoria, announcing that under the universal access agreement with the Commonwealth they would be providing money to the Inverleigh Kindergarten to provide the infrastructure required to deliver kindergarten facilities in the area. I thought, 'Perhaps I will go back and have a look at the source document because there was no acknowledgement about where that money might come from.' So I went onto the Premier of Victoria's website and had a bit of a look and, no, there was no indication that that money actually had come from the Commonwealth government under the COAG agreement. This is the reality: time and time again I see press releases coming out by the new state minister claiming responsibility for opening new facilities and providing money for kindergartens but, time and time again, I see that there is no acknowledgment or at least very, very poor acknowledgment that it comes under the agreement entered into by the Gillard government with all states and territories.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move In my last speech regarding these matters I spoke a great deal about Western Australia. I do not propose to do that tonight. The member for Durack and others from Western Australia can do that. It has been a long time since I have had anything to do with Western Australia. But in the conclusion of that speech I spoke about the income management and other welfare reforms which have been undertaken by this government. I spoke about their extension to other areas around Australia, in particular into my own community and I think that these reforms are critical but only if they are matched with opportunity. Specifically, I asked for them to be put into the community of Playford. I have been not only talking about this in parliament but also lobbying government ministers because I believe that while Playford, which incorporates the old city of Elizabeth and the old city of Munno Parra, has always been a great working-class community it has always been a community that has been buffeted by changes in the Australian economy, in particular the reduction of tariffs and the demolition of unskilled jobs. So we find that while the average unemployment rate across the country is 5.1 per cent, something we can all be proud of, the average rate across Playford is 12.7 per cent. In some suburbs it is as high as 20 per cent. We know that in some of these communities up to 48.2 per cent of the working age population is in receipt of some Centrelink benefit. We know that the average duration of unemployment is 54 weeks, as against the national average of 36 weeks. We know that all of this has a devastating impact on people's employment prospects, particularly in the new economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to note that in Playford we used to have a problem with jobs as there were just not enough jobs. When I came out of university I ended up, as a university graduate, being a cleaner. I ended up working in warehouses. I ended up being a trolley collector. I ended up doing casual work of all shapes and sizes—and if I were doing that work then almost certainly I would have displaced someone with less education, someone who was less able to participate in the education system and in the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that for such a long period people just did not have the opportunity to work. Of course, unemployment is the most destructive thing that you can do to a family. It is the most destructive thing that you can do to a community. We know that out of all of that has come the terrible blight of decades of unemployment. We have had intergenerational unemployment, simply families that could not get a start even after education and desperate attempts to find employment. Even after really trying hard, they could not find work and this led to all sorts of social problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The destruction of the family unit in many of these communities led to problems that were symptoms of this economic and social breakdown but ended up being problems in their own right. So we know that many of these communities need both specific action as to and specific changes to our welfare system. They need the linking of income management with the social security system and the child protection system. We know we have to interlink those systems so that they effectively manage people's incomes and effectively give people the assistance that they need to stabilise their households and, from there, gain employment, education and participation in the broader community. But we also know that we have to provide not just training but the prospect of a job at the end of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments can do things and I think in this area we have done a great job in terms of income management. Some five of 10 communities around the country are getting income protection and the others of the 10 are getting special programs to intervene to help teenage mothers and the like. But we are not at the end of it. A job is the most valuable thing. A government can take action but we need to provide work. That is why it is so good to see that in my community Holden's have provided a guarantee of 20 jobs off the line to long-term unemployed people who have completed a three-month, five-day-a-week training course. This training course is designed specifically to lift people out of unemployment and into work. It is designed specifically to intervene in people's lives and give them personal presentation and literacy and numeracy skills. It is designed basically around employability. I think that is critical, along with the government's welfare reforms, to sending the message that, although we expect more of people in this new economy and we are not prepared to leave people behind anymore after two decades of economic change, we are prepared to provide opportunity. Nearly all of the money to run these employability courses, these pre-employment courses, comes from federal programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They need employers to engage and we have seen both Holden and Woolworths provide these opportunities, provide this work. We have seen Holden now running a second program again some 40 places in the program with 20 employment opportunities. We have also seen Woolworths at Blakes Crossing embark on the Fresh 40 Program, which is all about providing people who have been unemployed and giving them the employability skills so that they can get to work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Welfare to work is about many things. It is about the government's changes, particularly around income management; particularly around team mothers. But it is also about embracing communities. It is about linking reform to opportunity. That is the critical part that has been missing in previous attempts. We have heard a lot about these matters over the years. We have seen many shock jocks say that if only people did a bit more or knocked on a few more doors they would get work. We have seen a lot of people frankly make excuses for those not seeking work. Neither approach is responsible. It is not responsible for community members; it is certainly not responsible for government members of MPs to advocate. Basically we need both reform which requires more of people and asks more of people in certain instances and it requires that they have stable households. It requires that they send their kids to school; it requires that they participate in the community the same way we would expect anybody to participate. It also requires the government and business and others to come up with the path to employment; to come up with a path out of the mire of intergenerational unemployment which can be so heartbreaking and so difficult and you can only feel for those people who often try. They try and they try and sometimes they get casual work and they just lift themselves out of these problems and something comes along, they lose their job and they are back on the heap. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not want to see that happening. We want to make sure that people are lifted out of poverty and lifted out of unemployment. We can only do that if we provide opportunity. As I said, for so long in these communities opportunity was absent. It is now the opposite. We now find that employers cannot fill vacancies; we find, in particular, employers who have skilled vacancies unable to find employment. We have to set up a system where we retrain those who are currently in employment. Retrain them to take on the work that is provided in the Defence industry; retrain them to work in the mines and in the civil construction area where there are going to be so many high paid opportunities and we will kick ourselves if we miss them. We need to retrain the unemployed—this group of people who have been left behind in previous economic growth; left behind after a decade of indifference by the coalition government, to these communities interests. We need to retrain them to take the unskilled jobs or the semi-skilled jobs that will be left behind in this great transition that we are going through. This great change in our terms of trade; this great economic bounty that will hit us which is presenting all sorts of challenges in all sorts of areas but one of them is this area and I think all of these reforms that the government has undertaken and which I personally lobbied for are the beginning of that transformation and the beginning of hope coming to these communities. I commend it to the house.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:38</span>):  Thank you Madam Deputy Speaker. I rise this evening to support this private member's motion. I believe income management, either compulsory or voluntary, has a valid place within Australian society regardless of the recipients colour or creed. This private members motion moved by a member of the government is rather refreshing. So many members of the government, because of their apparent high regard for equal opportunity, believe that the intervention by government with a program of income management somehow takes away the more important basic rights of individuals. This lofty, worldly view of human rights may be fine in debating circles however to hold a view that income management and its potential removal of basic or equal rights is more important than the lives of small innocent children, has moved me to support this motion. The motion is outlined in detail by the member for Wakefield. He highlights a number of statistical benefits as a result of income management. The negative impact of welfare does not discriminate against race as our moral responsibility to ensure all children—children of any heritage—trapped within the walls of welfare are fed, clothed, educated, safe and in a warm bed at night. These expectations must be realised for all children, not just some. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months ago the ABC, in cohorts with Animals Australia, put to air a carefully compiled piece to denigrate the live cattle export industry in Australia. I find it alarming that a population so ready to stop an industry in its tracks in an effort to stop the cruelty recently shown to be inflicted on animals overseas cannot show the same passion in response to the very real problem of cruelty to our children. The only explanation is that the population is unaware of the truth. That they have to be shown by the same people who pushed the button on their computer or got out of bed on a Sunday to attend a rally to influence a decision on something they know nothing about is remarkable. To choose to be sympathetic to animals and ignore our abused children, often in remote communities—children who have no voice and no button to push for help—is truly remarkable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Sexual abuse of children is not restricted to those of Aboriginal descent … nor to just the Northern Territory. The phenomenon knows no racial, age or gender borders. It is a national and international problem.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The classic indicia of children likely to suffer neglect, abuse and/or sexual abuse are unfortunately, particularly apparent in Aboriginal communities. Family dysfunctionality, as a catch-all phrase, reflects and encompasses problems of alcohol and drug abuse, poverty, housing shortages, unemployment and the like. All of these issues exist in many Aboriginal communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can stand here and espouse all manner of doctrine, but the truth of the matter is I do not have the answers to all of the problems faced by not only those in our remote Aboriginal communities but also those in the wider community who are suffering from the same—dare I say—social malaise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do know, however, that income management appears to be working and should be extended. It is instinctive to protect our young and we are morally bound to protect not only the young but also the feeble, the infirm, the disadvantaged. What sort of country have we become that our moral compass is so out of whack we have forgotten the horror that was made public in 2007? Women, children and the elderly are being abused on a daily basis and too many are pretending it is not happening. Income management ensures priority items such as rent, utilities, food, clothes, health items and basic household products are paid for. What it does not allow for is the spending of money on alcohol, pornography, tobacco, gambling products, gambling services, home brew kits or home brew concentrate, very specific.</span>

From 2001 to 2005 of all SDIs diagnosed in Aboriginal people, 8 per cent occurred in children under the age of 16 years, compared with 3.2 per cent for non-Aboriginal children. SDIs are statistically more likely to be found in Aboriginal children. From 2001 to 2005, an STD was identified in 64 children aged under 12 years. Some 54 of these children were identified as aboriginal, five were identified as non-aboriginal and the cultural identity of another five was not reported. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixty-four children under the age of 12 years were identified as having sexually transmitted diseases. Regardless of racial origin, these figures are abhorrent. I very much doubt that these children were having sex of their own free will. I dare say the majority of these innocent children were from homes where alcohol and drug abuse is the norm and where welfare money was spent on getting high. If even one child is saved from both the physical pain and the ongoing mental anguish because of welfare quarantining, it is worth it. I challenge anyone to disagree with me and I dare any civil libertarian to look me in the eye and tell me I am wrong. I have seen the damage done, I have heard the stories and I am disappointed that we did not initiate income management sooner. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">   Our welfare system in some cases creates long-term intergenerational dependency too often including those able to participate in work. Yes, good old-fashioned work. Work promotes self discipline and self-esteem—the Australian idiom of a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. Inability to manage money or spending in a manner that ignores the basic necessities has been a major problem in my remote communities. It is sadly a problem that for too long has been overlooked. Why, you may ask. I suggest because some bureaucrat decided that equal rights and political correctness were more important than mutual obligation. Going further than this motion, I would suggest that those communities which are supported by taxpayers but which have no chance of jobs are unsustainable. Imagine a life where each day rolls into another, one where nothing punctuates those days—no challenge, no responsibility, nothing to look forward to except the day the welfare cheque comes in. It is a life of boredom and hopelessness.</span>

We must move them to work. We must give back a sense of self pride. We must demand mutual obligation. Tough love is required. No matter what our colour, we instinctively know the difference between right and wrong from a very early age. Drugs and alcohol blur the ages of reality, but they do not change right from wrong.</span>

Have they looked into the eyes of a wife who is no longer beaten and raped by a husband fuelled by alcohol and drugs? I do not think so. If they had, they would support income management. There cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to reform, and income management may not be the best answer to a range of insidious social conditions; but it is the best answer we have at this point in time. To ignore the plight of children locked within the walls of generational welfare is to be complicit in the horrendous outcomes of that cycle. I seriously support this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:49</span>):  This is an important issue. It slips through when everyone is trying to be politically correct around the way we view and identify issues, particularly those associated with welfare. What the member for Wakefield has been able to do is to ensure that our focus is firmly and unwaveringly fixed on families and children in particular. Just to reiterate, income management is an arrangement whereby a percentage of the income will be quarantined to be available for priority goods for families, such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Income management is an essential tool necessary for individuals to participate, particularly families, in the normal discourse of life and for ensuring that their families will not miss out. There are many families in Australia that sometimes struggle to stretch their budget to ensure that they are providing the necessary support for basic elements of life. Sometimes, regrettably, because of various choices, particularly bad choices, that people make there is not enough money available in the family budget to ensure that provision for their family, particularly for their children, is met in an appropriate way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that this initiative seeks to do is ensure that individuals have the necessary skills and knowledge about how to manage their finances, things that many of us take for granted. But the truth of the matter is that it does not equally apply to everybody, particularly those on a limited income through a welfare system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we discuss things like this, often people want to talk about the fundamentals of human rights. In fact, the member for Durack just referred to that. I often speak about human rights in the House. But, first and foremost, in any discourse on human rights must be the human rights that prevail for children. A child who is being neglected or at risk of being neglected deserves to be assisted in having a brighter future under the care and guidance of their parents, particularly those who are capable of taking care of them. Sometimes they have to learn to take care of them. It would be a great tragedy to see people lose custody of their children simply because of lack of education and information on how to manage their family finances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have only been in my current electorate for a little over 12 months but within my former electorate was Macquarie Fields, which is a very significant housing commission area and certainly an economically challenged area. There are many issues there. I spent a lot of time there with people such as Father Chris Riley, trying to do things, particularly post the 2005 riots. I met up with a bloke who freely admitted he was a drug addict. When we were having some discussions about his financial situation, he became very morose. He admitted to me that if there had been some greater effort to actually control his welfare he may not have lost his three children. He thought he had a system available to him where he got his payments and all the rest of it. He had good intentions of looking after his kids, sending them to school and doing all the other things that most parents do. But when he got into drugs and alcohol and things like that, a lot of that fell away. In fact, so did his parental responsibilities of ensuring his kids went to school and a few other things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequence was that the New South Wales government, through DOCS, moved in and, rightfully, put the children into foster homes where they, at least, could have an opportunity for a future. This bloke asserted to me, 'If there were some system of intervention, some system that could have prevailed, other than "Give me the cheque every fortnight"—some way that I could have been held to account for what I was not doing, I might have woken up to myself.' I think that is the point that the member for Wakefield made. This is not necessarily a case of people being bad or squandering their money and doing all those other things; a lot of it is just inexperience in doing the right thing, failing to learn and failing to see the relevance of that to children. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMPKINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:54</span>):  I wish to add my support tonight to the concept of income management. The reality is that right around this country, from different groups, different communities, different places, there are parents who are making decisions that are not always in the best interests of their child. Whether that is through human frailty or an intent to put their own priorities first and above that of their children, the outcomes can be the same. The children finish second, and that is a tragedy. It is something that we need to guard against.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said in the past that I believe there should be more times when, if a child is in danger or is in circumstances of such negativity in the home, children should be taken from their parents to protect them, to make their lives a better opportunity for them in the future. But it is the case that after times of crime or drug use or abuse of various substances, in circumstances where the parents are not making good decisions, then there is that place for income management. When the agencies have identified the families, the parents or the carers who need to be assisted then that is certainly the case and that should occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the fact that income management started as part of the Northern Territory intervention and continues today. I hope to see it rolled across the whole country, not only where we just say a particular area needs support and everyone in that area should be on income management, but also in those circumstances where state agencies have identified the opportunities for families to be assisted under an obligation, if nothing else. If they have identified those families then it does not matter what colour their skin is or what race or from what background they are. The important thing is that we have the will in this place to step in and do what needs to be done for the sake of the children. I certainly appreciate that there is wide bipartisan support for exactly these sorts of measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this scenario, we know there are times when people will go out there and decide what the priorities are for their family. Sometimes it can be cigarettes, alcohol, drugs or maybe it is gambling. There are a lot of different vices in many respects that demonstrate that a person has a skewed view of the world. Those vices are the high priority and the needs of the child, whether it is good food on the table or clean clothes on the children, tend to come second. That is a tragedy and again it goes to the point that, in all the cases when families are identified as being in need of assistance such as income support, this is where it comes in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that here has been success. There have been people who have embraced the obligation put upon them and have risen above the old circumstances under which they lived. But we need to be careful as well. People need to never forget that in these cases of adversity or when things are going wrong in their lives, the first thing they should do is look in the mirror and decide what part they have played. We need to be very careful in this country that we do not always look for someone who has failed or has these sorts of issues. What has society done wrong? The reality is that we need to look at ourselves first. We need to have that sense of personal responsibility before we look for others to blame. So we need to be careful that the victim culture in this country does not let people off the hook, so that they do not embrace their own weaknesses, so that they can work on improving themselves to get themselves out of trouble with the help of society.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:00</span>):  It is with some regret that I rise to speak tonight, at a time when there are numerous consequences from global financial turmoil and equally from the effects of the poor economic and financial management of this Labor-Greens government. It is only going to get worse once we start to see the full impact of the carbon tax, which is like a cyclone bearing down on our economy, businesses and consumers, who are already beginning to feel some of the effects and are beginning to batten down the hatches. We are seeing this in reduced retail trade and poor business sentiment survey figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor-Greens government has, over the course of the past four years, presided over waste and mismanagement on a scale never before seen in the history of this great nation, and now they wish to finish the job by introducing a carbon tax at a time of great global economic uncertainty. It is important to consider in this context the principles that allow a market economy to function effectively. These principles include protection of private property rights, freedom of contract, personal responsibility, open and fair markets, monetary flexibility and a steadiness of economic policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been well demonstrated globally that countries with a well-defined system of laws that protect private property rights have prospered, and it is concerning to note the doubt being placed in the agricultural industry due to the rights of mining companies under their mining leases. The doubt that is created in one of our nation's most important industries is a grave concern, as it flows through to other areas of the community as people begin to wonder about the security of food supplies and other agricultural products in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Freedom of contract is an essential component of a well-functioning market economy and means that individuals and businesses are free to negotiate the terms and conditions of their own contracts free from government interference. A current example of the government's failure to adhere to this principle is in respect of the changes proposed under the FOFA reforms, particularly in relation to opt-in provisions. Clients of financial planners have always had the option to move to another financial planner at any time that they see fit, and there is no necessity for the government to add to an already large body of red tape and regulations swamping the financial planning industry by applying onerous opt-in provisions. If the government wish to truly improve the future outcomes for the community, they would do far better to focus on the corporate governance issues affecting the industry, as has been clearly outlined by the Cooper review, and seek to make the product manufacturers more accountable for the products that they bring to market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Personal responsibility, as we frequently discuss, is something that over the past several decades has been increasingly on the wane. We as a nation seek to have other people solve our problems for us and, unfortunately, over the past few decades increasingly the government has been seen as a saviour for people's problems—and that is irrespective of what side of politics we are on. That devalues the notion of personal responsibility. It is time that we again value the notion of personal responsibility and be prepared to be held accountable for our actions and accept the consequences thereof. It is not good enough for people to go cap in hand to governments to solve their problems, as this ultimately leads to bigger governance with more legislation to administer, the end result being an ever greater bureaucracy and a growing loss of freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Open markets are the cornerstone of our economy, and the ability to trade both internally and externally is vitally important to the future economic prospects of this country. It is important that we continue to pursue new free trade agreements and also to prosecute the argument for removal of subsidies and tariffs globally, which distort our global trade markets. Distortion of subsidies and tariffs results in an obscuring of price signals that indicate to companies what goods and services are actually required. In addition, governments who provide these subsidies are in actuality redistributing the nation's wealth to industries that would not survive without the subsidy. This does not provide the basis for sound economic policy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the greatest problems we have in the world today is that of monetary and financial stability. Since 1971 we have had a global financial system which has developed into a debt based fiat money and inflationary model. This has resulted in a perceived increase in wealth, when in reality it has lead to a decrease in real wealth, increasing inequalities in wealth and income and a general loss of income for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The principles that I have touched on ultimately should all lead to a steadiness of economic policy and activity. It is therefore instructional to look at the current results being generated under the guidance of the current Labor-Greens government. In the four years since Labor came to power, they have squandered a surplus of over $20 billion and succeeded in racking up a net debt of some $107 billion—and growing. These funds have been spent on a variety of projects which may in the initial concept have been sound, but the execution has left a lot to be desired—projects such as the pink batt insulation scheme, which was rorted and resulted in many homes being burned and lives being lost, and the BER school halls program, which in some areas resulted in buildings that were grossly overpriced, were not what schools wanted or were a combination of both. That program lacked consultation with schools and communities to determine what those schools and communities actually required—although that was not across the board; there were areas that were very successful. The NBN has the potential to cost far more than the allocated $36 billion, a cost far in excess of any other similar program globally and one which, despite assurances to the contrary, does not appear to be providing any cost savings in services. It is a project whose magnitude should be reviewed. A cost benefit analysis should be completed to ensure Australian taxpayers are getting value for money. We can touch on many other programs. The set-top box program and the  immigration program are other  examples of failures of this current Labor-Greens government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this we have the spectre of a carbon tax, which, according to my investigations at this point at least, will provide no practical on-the-ground environmental benefit. It will however provide us with some of the most expensive power in the world and significantly damage our small to medium sized businesses, which are the majority employers in this nation. That will provide a consequent flow-on to the impact on jobs. In addition, government wishes to seek to implement a mining resource rent tax, which will impact on the sole successful industry in our economy at present. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been ably demonstrated over many years that bigger government and higher taxes or higher fees and charges is not the solution to future economic growth. It is actually lower taxes and less regulation, a sound financial system, that provides the framework for businesses to grow and prosper and for our economy to grow and prosper for future generations. It will always be the case that capital being retained by business for future growth will be used far more effectively and thoughtfully than that dollar of capital being in the government's hands for purposes of taxation, government spending or redistribution of wealth. It is those avenues, through capital being retained in business, that will fund the future growth of our economy to prosper into the future, not through the new and higher taxes and regulation imposed by a government that appears to have little if any economic understanding, despite their protestations to the contrary.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms GRIERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:09</span>):  Rather than the mantra of misery just delivered by the other side I rise to actually highlight what can be achieved by individual members of parliament and by a government that is absolutely committed to a prosperous and fair economy. I have risen on other occasions in this parliament to speak in support of legislation to make superannuation fairer, to defend the rights of our workers and to make our economy a more prosperous one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I rise to speak of the human consequences of a failure to comply with legislatively mandated superannuation requirements and the toll that this can have on families, and did have on the family of Robert Watson. Four years ago, I put on the record my sympathy for Robert's widow, Kathy, and his eight children and 10 grandchildren. I reiterate those condolences now. In March 2007, a partition wall at a Central Coast construction site collapsed, killing Mr Watson. At the time, Mr Watson's employer was behind on his superannuation payments, denying his family a death benefit of up to $100,000. This left Mr Watson's family in financial distress at a time when they should have been able to grieve for the loss of a husband and father without additional worries about financial matters. Thankfully for Robert Watson's family, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union stepped in and assisted with funeral and other expenses and offered counselling support for the family. I note that Mr Watson was not a member of that union, but that is the sort of action that that union takes to support individuals. I acknowledge particularly the work of former secretary Andrew Ferguson on this particular matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, the CFMEU also negotiated an ex gratia payment of $57,000 for the family from the employer. Although it fell short of the death benefit that his family should have been paid, I do acknowledge the willingness of the employer to reach that agreement with Robert's family and the union and to go some way to righting their initial wrong. However, it should never have come to this. No worker should have to worry about whether his superannuation guarantee is being paid by his employer. The $174,000 fine imposed on the head contractor and subcontractor earlier this year by the Industrial Court of New South Wales, after a WorkCover investigation, which of course has taken quite a long time, cannot undo the financial and emotional damage that was done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2007, I raised on three occasions in parliament, including twice as the chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, Mr Watson's tragic case. To its credit, the Australian Taxation Office took heed of those warnings, sought extra resources and commenced a more rigourous approach towards the investigations into the nonpayment of superannuation entitlements. This investigation has since yielded some very positive results. The ATO has discovered that unpaid superannuation over the past five years has totalled $1.3 billion, with the most affected employees being in low-income, casual or part-time employment, especially in the trucking industry, which is interesting, and the auto repair and electrical services industries. This year, the ATO has already collected a total of $294 million in unpaid superannuation and penalties and it expects to investigate a further 17,000 complaints about the nonpayment of superannuation entitlements next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many small businesses not only are not complying but also are unaware of their superannuation obligations, as well as other responsibilities they owe to their employees, and with approximately 50 per cent of small businesses actually failing within the first five years of their operation, workers can be left in a precarious position and significantly out of pocket. It is often workers and contractors who lose out when a company goes into liquidation and there is little left over to pay outstanding entitlements. That is why it is encouraging to see that the ATO is not simply adopting a rigourous and punitive stance but is working to ensure that employers are aware of their superannuation and taxation responsibilities through greater online information sharing and preventative initiatives. The long-term implications of employers not paying superannuation contributions for families can be destabilising. If an employer is not paying the required payments, a worker may reach retirement age and have significantly less money saved than they would have; thus necessitating that they stay in the workforce or organise alternative income. Many people, just like in the case of Robert and Kathy Watson, would not know that their employer was not paying superannuation contributions until it is too late. I would like to publicly acknowledge and thank Joanne McCarthy, a journalist of the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Newcastle Herald</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>for her ongoing attention to this matter over the past four years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But today, through the Securing Super reforms introduced by this government, we hope to prevent situations such as this arising again by implementing some of the recommendations of the Cooper review of superannuation. This will require that employees receive information on their payslips about the actual amount of superannuation being paid into their account and quarterly notifications from their superannuation fund if regular payments cease. It is that sort of assurance that every employee needs. By providing employees with more timely information the risk of superannuation default et cetera is substantially reduced. The Securing Super reforms also increase the enforcement powers of the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman, who will be given stronger powers to ensure that businesses pay their employees superannuation entitlements by extending the director's penalty regime to cover unpaid super entitlements and improve the capacity of the ATO to police super payments. These reforms were part of the 2011-12 budget and will go a long way to protecting workers' rights to superannuation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one further matter that I would like to bring to the attention of the house: Last week I updated the house on the disturbing release of hexavalent chromium over the suburb of Stockton in my electorate and the unacceptable delay by both the company responsible, Orica, a multinational firm, and the New South Wales government to notify affected residents. It is with deep regret and some anger that I advise the house of further developments. Last Friday, Orica released a quantity of highly poisonous arsenic above allowable levels into the Hunter River—and this is right in the city of Newcastle. This isn't somewhere up the river or far away; this is a kilometre from where I live, I suppose. According to details provided by Orica, 1.2 megalitres of industrial waste released into the river contained 0.067 milligrams per litre of arsenic, well above the allowable limit of 0.05 milligrams per litre. This, however, was not the end of the bad news nor was it an isolated incident it seems. According to reports in the media today, this latest incident represented the 131st time since 2000 that Orica has breached its pollution license. It is no surprise therefore that residents in Stockton and in other areas surrounding the plant, including Mayfield, Carrington, Fern Bay, Maryville, have very little confidence in the safeguards to prevent or manage such industrial accidents on their doorsteps. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I spoke to the House on the issue last week, I note that Premier O'Farrell, in the face of sustained political pressure, announced an inquiry into the leak of hexavalent chromium. It is abundantly clear however that the terms of reference of this inquiry do not go far enough. If the residents of Stockton are to have any confidence, the inquiry must examine why New South Wales environment Minister Parker waited almost 2½ days to notify the residents of Stockton and why she was able to advise the state member for Newcastle, Tim Owen, her colleague, of the leak almost 24 hours before either Parker or Owen advised Newcastle constituents. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald </span>noted today, the inquiry will not reassure anxious voters unless it also asks hard questions of the environment minister and senior officials about the seemingly outrageous delay in informing potentially-affected residents of the chromium leak. The large Catholic school in my electorate chose to do their fun run the next morning, for the whole school, taking them to Stockton to do that. Perhaps they would not have done that if they had been informed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry, though, if it is to have any relevance to the residents who live side by side with these industries every single day, must examine the broader impact of industrial activities on Kooragang Island and the port of Newcastle on surrounding residents. I have written to New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell to reiterate the urgent need for publicly accessible 24/7 air and water quality monitoring as well as 24/7 alert and notification systems to be put in place in Newcastle. I have also questioned the adequacy of the provisions and enforcement practices under the New South Wales environment protection act and requested they be urgently reviewed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales government's handling of this incident to date has been nothing but deplorable. This inquiry, however, does present an opportunity to learn from these appalling mistakes and secure a better long-term balance between Newcastle's industry and the right of nearby residents to live free from the fear of harmful pollution and to know that their health and welfare are being taken very seriously.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:19</span>):  Thank you very much Madam Deputy Speaker. I would like to raise three issues in relation to grievances within my electorate. Firstly and most significantly in terms of the sad news today of the loss of 200 jobs from the Western Port steel works run by BlueScope at Hastings in my electorate. Secondly in relation to a better deal for autism families and thirdly a matter on behalf of petitioners within my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn firstly to the issue of BlueScope Steel and the loss of 200 direct employee jobs and approximately 60 contractors jobs from the Long Island steel plant, sometimes known as the Western Port steel plant at Hastings in my electorate of Flinders. This is a desperately sad outcome for workers, for their families and for the town and community of Hastings and the surrounding areas. Hastings is a town of approximately 8,500 people. To lose 260 jobs from within Hastings and the broader area is a big blow to the working population. I think every member of this house takes their job seriously and would feel the weight of that loss. It is significant and it is real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the macroeconomic matters let me say that we have endeavoured to be utterly responsible with accepting that this has been primarily caused by the combination of the high Australian dollar, the high cost of inputs in terms of raw materials for steel, the low price being given in terms of sale and demand and the extremely poor export markets for a variety of reasons not the least of which is the massive production of North Asian steel across China, Japan and Korea. This is a reality and we are not claiming that this set of job losses was caused by the carbon tax because it predates them, but having spoken with company executives let me be absolutely clear that they said it was their fiduciary duty to consider the fact that the formal package which they face at the moment is a four-year package but that their net present value estimates for the future in calculating how they look at long term investments are made over 40 years. They cannot bank on a change of government; they are not in a position to assume a change of government so therefore they have to assume a carbon tax in precisely the form that the government has set out with a four-year assistance package but a 40-year tax, given that it is planned out to 2050. Those are real considerations but we have been responsible in saying that this outcome today is in its immediate form the consequence of deep and difficult global conditions for Australian manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background the worst thing that could possibly happen, given the fragility of Australian manufacturing as seen by OneSteel last week and as seen by Blue Scope this week, the worst thing that could happen is to add an additional carbon tax on top of it. For those who rightly care about the environment, this will do nothing for the environment because it will simply shift the weight of production to less regulated environments in China, India and Indonesia whether it is steel or injection moulding for plastic or cement or other such products. That is the reality. We will simply shift the burden of production and the emissions generation to other environments with the carbon tax in this form at this time. It is the single worst thing we could do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the individual package for the workers, I appreciate the outline of that which has been done by the Prime Minister. We called for action immediately and I understand of course that the Prime Minister's office may well have had a heads up. I raised four matters in dealing with the Prime Minister's office and associated departments this afternoon. Firstly, having spoken with workers who have been retrenched prior to today, the package should extend to workers who were released in the last month because today was the culmination of a process not the commencement of a process. Secondly, consideration has to be given to contractors and if there is a relevant test such as 50 per cent of their income coming from the one supplier being BlueScope, then those contractors for the purposes of the package should be allowed to participate. Thirdly, it is absolutely unacceptable that there is not a comparable package to that given to the Illawarra to assist the Mornington Peninsula with the generation of new jobs. There is a $30 million package, including a $20 million Commonwealth fund. We would expect at least a quarter of that in the case of Hastings and an agreement with the Victorian government. Fourthly, given that the Prime Minister has said that the carbon tax was not responsible, none of this package should therefore be linked to the passage of the carbon tax. To hold support for workers hostage to the carbon tax would be a disgrace. I trust this will not happen, but if it does we will hold this government to account and we will hound, harry and work until such time as the linkage is severed. If the Prime Minister says this loss of jobs is not related to the carbon tax, then compensation cannot, and must not, be tied to passage of the carbon tax, which itself will bring a second wave of effects as surely as night follows day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to a second topic and that is the status of parents within my electorate and elsewhere in Australia who have struggled with the great challenge of autism. I recently completed a 500 kilometre walk for autism, and the funds raised have been shared between the Abacus Learning Centre and Autism Victoria. I did it from the complete surprise at the number of parents who have outlined the condition of autism and the difficulty in acquiring services to me over the last couple of years. This is particularly so in the case of early intervention as well as support for adults with autism once they leave school. This is a great challenge. Autism is, of course, a tremendous spectrum. At one end are those who are highly functional but who suffer from sensory overload, which may manifest itself in the form of extreme shyness or sensitivity to light, noise and smell or perhaps aversion to water with all the social consequences that flow from that. As part of that process we raised about $31,000 for Autism Victoria and the Abacus Learning Centre in Hastings. Abacus was set up by parents such as Michael and Lauren Moore and many others to help young children try to get the building blocks necessary to be able to manage their autism and to learn as well as they can. Many of these children have gone on to sensational outcomes. The dux of Westernport Secondary College two years ago was a boy with autism, but he was supported by his friends and his fellow students. They tolerated the differences and he in turn was able to flourish despite the challenges. On the walk we visited over 52 schools; we had constituents join as all the way. I was delighted that one mother, Natalie, joined for 180 kilometres and another, Marilyn, joined for 200 kilometres. The walk for them became a totemic statement about their own sons, Lewis and Joel, each of whom has autism. We worked with students all around the electorate of Flinders. I want to thank all my staff who were involved—Tina and Melina, Lyn and Denise, Wendy and my great friend Sue de Bono. The task as we go forward is to push for a national autism summit with three specific goals: firstly, early intervention; secondly, respite; thirdly, individual support. In the brief time remaining I wish to table a petition on behalf of the Mornington Peninsula human rights group, whose views I respect very much.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">):</span>  I rise tonight again to defend the residents of the Holt electorate and surrounding areas. People who are not from Holt or from the outer suburbs of Melbourne—suburbs like Cranbourne, Narre Warren, Lyndhurst and Devon Hills—are often very quick to judge these suburbs and the character of the people that live there and the industries that sustain these communities. But in actual fact, they know very little about the people, although they rush to judgment about the suburbs and the industries that make up this region. So my grievance contribution tonight addresses again the values, the opportunities and the dreams of the people of the Holt electorate, those little known or often written off aspirations and achievements that are dismissed by people willing to trash talk a suburb based on a sensational incident or article or sometimes even a postcode.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have often said in this place that I get frustrated with the depiction of Fountain Gate, where my electorate office is, as a suburb defined by <span style="font-style:italic;">Kath &amp; Kim</span> and a party boy called Corey who put Narre Warren on the map for all the wrong reasons or if I read in the local papers recently about driving and speeding offences in Cranbourne. I can tell you for a start that the people in Fountain Gate do not share the particular perspectives on the way they are portrayed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Kath &amp; Kim</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you a synopsis of the people in my electorate. They are family oriented and they have sacrificed a lot to buy a house, to send their kids to school and university and to maintain their involvement in sport and in their community. They are there to create a better future for themselves, their kids and their grandchildren. Many have come from overseas in postwar years to settle down in Australia as skilled workers or as students. Many others are second, third and fourth generation Australians. In my time representing this area there has been much discussion about young people. Let me tell you about some young people from my electorate that have gone on to do some amazing things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us start, for example, with Andrew Bogut who grew up in Endeavour Hills and has been a sensation for Australia at basketball. Born to Croatian immigrants, Bogut was selected first overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2005 NBA draft. The seven foot, 260 pounds centre was a star at the University of Utah for two years before declaring for the draft. Bogut is the first Australian player to be drafted No. 1 overall. Bogut has played six seasons in the NBA and finished third in votes for the 2006 NBA Rookie of the Year award. Bogut's international career began with Australian's 2003 junior world championship team and has also led him to compete for the Boomers of the 2004 Athens Olympics, the 2006 FIBA World Championship and the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Bogut has become a local legend and it is great and salient that he still resides in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne during the NBA off season.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Samantha Downie, another young local, has made her mark on the fashion world since appearing in <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s Next Top Model</span>. Like many other young people from Holt, she studied at Monash University's Barrie campus, just one of the number of tertiary institutions that are in the region, and that make up a rapidly growing education hub for the south-eastern suburbs. Speaking with students from Casey Grammar in Cranbourne last week about their plans beyond year 12, I was delighted to hear the unlimited nature of their dreams and their aspirations. Some were showcasing their obvious talents for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wizard of Oz</span> musical at the Arts Performing Centre that the school acquired under the BER funding. Others were planning to study law at university and others were more interested in broadening their horizons with significant travel, work and volunteering opportunities abroad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to many media reports, many young people in Holt personify the next generation of investment savvy, career confident go-getters that this country needs. They are financially responsible and independent young people. Apprentices have moved on to complete their trades and many I have spoken to have probably moved into business and home ownership. The last census recorded that Holt had the highest figure amongst electorates for homes being purchased at around 55 per cent. Why wouldn't people want to live at the foot of the Dandenongs where there are great schools, great amenities and great shopping centres like Fountain Gate?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a long-term resident of Endeavour Hills, I know the appeal of living and raising a family in these suburbs, and that suburb in particular. The high level of home ownership in my electorate tells of the dreams and aspirations of the people in Holt. It says that my constituents believe in creating their financial security based on the quintessential Australian asset, the home, and at the same time contribute to this nation's wealth as best they can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the main reasons families are choosing to come and live in the outer suburbs of Melbourne is the great infrastructure—great schools. In my electorate of Holt the Australian government has invested some $129 million across 101 projects to improve the quality of our schools in the local community via the schools modernisation program, the BER. This was clearly evident when I opened new learning facilities at Chalcot Lodge Primary School earlier this month, including a TV studio, radio station, vegetable garden and cookery centre. All families, teachers and students were delighted with these new facilities, which will make a huge difference in helping students reach their full potential. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another reason for people continuing to come and live in my electorate of Holt is that it offers families a wide range of sport and recreational facilities for everyone to enjoy. Whatever your sport or recreation needs, you are sure to find what you are looking for. According to the statistics from the City of Casey in Holt, in surrounding areas there are over 620 parks and reserves, 258 playgrounds, 10 skate parks, 21 BMX tracks, many off-road bicycle paths, 200 sports clubs and 105 sports grounds. In addition to these many parks, gardens, playgrounds, skate parks and sporting centres, including Casey Fields, the premier outdoor sports and recreation site in Melbourne's south-east, Holt also offers two exceptional aquatic and leisure centres—the Casey RACE in Cranbourne and the Casey ARC in Fountain Gate—as well as Myuna Farm, where the farm comes to the city, and Frog Hollow Reserve in Endeavour Hills. Frog Hollow Reserve in Endeavour Hills is one of those wonderful multiuse parklands in my local area. This park is surrounded by residential properties along the north-west boundary from the eastern corner at Hallam North Road and the southern end abutting the Monash Freeway. Active recreational facilities currently present at the site include rugby facilities, cricket facilities and Auskick. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth mentioning that the Friends of Frog Hollow Reserve have played a critical role in improving the local environment, protecting local frog species in the reserve and organising events such as the National Tree Day plantings, which were held on 31 July 2011 and were enthusiastically embraced by many local residents. Two individuals in particular, Steve Hallett and Ray Darbritz, from the Friends of Frog Hollow Reserve, have been working in this area for over 10 years. It has been phenomenal to watch the transformation of a place that was almost desert-like into a lush, green, biodiverse area, a fantastic habitat for rare frogs, flora and fauna. It has been an amazing experience watching that transformation, which has been done by two people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Holt electorate is also known for its proximity to the manufacturing heartland of Australia. Some 22 per cent of the workforce in my electorate are employed in manufacturing, which is the most of any federal electorate in Australia. What annoys me is that we hear a lot about the mining boom that this country is going through and the benefits to the national economy, and we do not deny that. But, notwithstanding the terrible news that we have been hearing recently, how often do we make manufacturing front and centre in discussion about the national economy? The workers in my electorate, from forklift drivers, fitters and turners to machine operators and many more, are the people who have toiled away to make a living, and many proudly have the rewards of home ownership and financial independence to show for it. Interestingly, many people who I think are ill informed—and economic commentators, I might point out—dismiss the manufacturing sector, forgetting the incredibly proud history that our sector has and the tradition of Australian innovation and building practices. The comment that I have heard even recently in some discussions is: 'Eventually all manufacturing will go offshore—right?' Keep that sort of attitude and it will. But we cannot afford for that to actually happen. Let me tell you, with the quality of the manufacturers in my electorate and the commitment that they have, they are ensuring that that will not happen. Companies like Jayco, just outside my electorate—an amazing company built by one man—Icon Plastics, Grenda Bus Company, basically run by the Grenda family for many years, are icons of manufacturing in Dandenong. For those who criticise people around and in my electorate, get a sat nav, come down and see that these people are some of the best people in Australia and one of the best electorates in Australia to represent. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IYS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr OAKESHOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:40</span>):   Despite being a strong advocate of pricing carbon I disagree with the statement that climate change is the moral challenge of our time. Instead, in my view, there is a bigger one. The real moral and economic challenge of our time is access and participation rates in Australian education, particularly the structural inequities for regional Australians, poor Australians and Indigenous Australians. Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group highlighted this problem when she reported on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A </span>several weeks ago that over 40 per cent of Australian workers cannot read or comprehend the standard operating manual. This echoes reports that six million Australians are functionally illiterate or innumerate. This in anyone's language should be seen as a massive structural failure. I do not know how or why we got here but I am disgusted we are here. These figures are a shameful failure of the way education policy has interacted or not interacted with business and our broader community. We are all too comfortable leaving too many Australians out of full engagement in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is missing out on significant productivity gain waiting to happen through a ready made home-grown workforce waiting to be engaged if we seize the opportunity post-Bradley to shape the education options better than we have in the past. From the most recent figures available, we have more than a 25 per cent difference in the access and participation rates for metropolitan versus regional students, for Indigenous versus non-Indigenous students and for rich versus poor. Regional, poor and Indigenous being left behind—in my view, it is shameful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent an electorate that is regional, Indigenous and poor and for that reason I am determined to do what I can to see this issue addressed. In the post-Bradley environment, while I acknowledge there are those who are nervous or fearful about certain aspects of a demand-driven system, from my perspective I am seeing much greater engagement between the higher education system and local communities such as the mid-North Coast of New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had previously never talked to a vice chancellor until late 2008. Now the conversations are detailed and many and there does seem to be a real desire to engage better with regions like the mid-North Coast than what has gone before. If Bradley has contributed to this then Bradley is working. The inequities in regional, Indigenous and poor access and participation figures in higher learning are now being acknowledged and the start of addressing these inequities, I hope, has begun. Culturally, this want to address the inequality in these three key areas is challenging many communities. If I am honest about my region, and I know it would be similar elsewhere, there is a certain level of comfort in being on the receiving end of inequity. It is easy to be left out or left behind because it is then someone else's fault.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher education has traditionally been positioned as something for the top three, maybe three or four, out of 10 students. There is a bit of a 'group think' from the others to make it okay that only the 'smart people' do higher learning. It is almost oxymoronic logic in my view that gets comfort from the fact that the smart go on to higher learning as an argument to justify why not to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This cultural logic in Australia is now being challenged in my region and I hope in others. We are starting to reject the assumption that smart people do higher learning and instead we are insisting that higher learning helps make smart people. As I said in my first speech to this parliament in 2008, the motto I want engrained into the minds of young people from the mid-North Coast—and right around Australia—is study for a job, study for a job, study for a job. This is not a conversation about the three out of 10 who, wherever they are from, will succeed. They will be the post graduate engine room that keeps all universities viable into the future and go on to achieve wonderful things in their fields of interest around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in my view, the great challenge to overcome within Australia is the inequity of how to better engage the seven out of 10 students who do not have the cultural aspiration to engage. Many of these will be the very first in their families for generations to even think about higher learning. Many will cop grief from brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers for the mere thought that they could go to university, or to do higher learning generally. Many are not the top secondary students but many still have a glimmer of want to go further and are easily lost for a whole number of social and cultural reasons. Many face social realities that are vastly different from the top end of any town, whether Sydney or Melbourne, making an 'apple with apple' entry mark system into higher learning, for example, a further contributor to the inequity that we are already trying to overcome. In my view this is the challenge of the moment and the next step for reform considerations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Post-Bradley, we have seen structural change to challenge the education system to better engage on this question of inequity. I am less worried than some about the uncapped, demand-driven implications of these changes, although I do listen to people, such as Jim Barber from the University of New England, who want to see some special loadings and support for regional universities, particularly those which may be challenged by an uncapped, demand-driven system. Generally, I think there are more opportunities for education and for regional education than there are threats posed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is an emerging concern, however, is the 'Bradley-readiness' of the broader communities where cultural change is being sought. As an example, only last month at one of my local land councils nine traineeships were on offer with guaranteed jobs at the end—good jobs—but the land council executive had to scout around the meeting room and around the community for ideas of who could fill these welcome places. It is not that potential candidates do not exist but that for a whole number of complex reasons there is a reluctance to take up the opportunity presented. There is a clear demand inequity in Indigenous communities, in the regions and for the poor, but the emerging concern and challenge is that we may be left with a supply problem unless we engage and empower communities much better than we have in the past. This is where our model of 'place based' learning becomes so critical, and is now in need of greater investment than ever before. Without more thought and more work I am not sure those who are being targeted through structural reform will be picked up and empowered by education options that we all want on their behalf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The call today, therefore, is for government to do some more parallel work in aspiration-building in key communities. It is a huge step to be the first in the family to choose higher education and more guidance and support to make this happen is needed. If anyone needs to borrow a model to get started on this community capacity building, I am very proud that we have our own—I call it the mini-education revolution—on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. We recognise this challenge and are actively looking to do what we can to assist and empower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, when I was first elected, I found a very difficult local education environment. The secondary education streams were at war with each over the rollout of the technical colleges, the three secondary streams were hotly contesting everything that moved and there was very little engagement between the secondary and tertiary sectors, both public and private. Seventeen of us decided to do something about it and formed the Port Macquarie Education and Skills Forum. Its brief was to build as many seamless pathways as possible, with a student focus on collaboration, not duplication. The council led the charge and employed someone full time to put together a local access and participation in education strategy. The Education and Skills Forum adopted a 40 per cent or higher bachelor degree by 2025 as a local target, coming off a very low base of 12 per cent. We all knew it was aspirational but we chased the desire to participate. As meetings continued, it became increasingly obvious how little the various streams within the education had previously talked to or trusted each other. It was also obvious how powerful, at a local level, these talks and this trust can be when addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a consequence of this work and many issues now being sorted out locally I think we are positioning ourselves to be able to address inequality within our region and to be an example for others. Due to the success of the Port Macquarie model we have a similar one in the Manning Valley. The Manning Valley Education and Skills Forum is now up and running with the Macleay Education and Skills Forum hopefully coming soon. I am also pleased to hear that beyond my own electorate the wheat belt of Western Australia has picked up this model and is in the process of replicating it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, reforms in education will not matter as much as they should unless key local communities are fully networked and empowered. There is work needed from government to assist in this regard. Unless local communities have greater ownership of this process, and are empowered through the place based model of thinking, then Canberra will struggle to achieve the desired outcomes we all want to see happen and we will have a lesser education reform agenda than we otherwise could have. From my perspective that would be a huge opportunity lost for dealing with the moral challenge of our time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:49</span>):  It is hard to accept or believe that in a democratic country as wealthy as Australia many people with a disability in their families are still left to struggle each and every day. Most Australians assume that if people are born with a disability or acquire one later in life some system, somewhere, will take care of them. Sadly, this is not always the case. People with a disability, their families and their carers know only too well the daily struggle for services and support—how often the system fails to deliver essential services. They know how often desperate families are left to fill the gaps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also huge inequity. People receive different levels of support depending on how, when and where their disability was acquired. This situation will only grow worse in the future. As the population ages and as medical intervention at birth increases, the number of people with a disability will surely rise. At the same time, the number of unpaid carers, family members and friends who are willing and able to provide support will decrease. It is therefore time to take stock and plan properly for the future. We need a vision for equity, for fairness and for justice for those with a disability and the wonderful people who look after them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A national disability insurance scheme represents a fundamental reform to the way services are funded and delivered. It is a social reform of the scale of the introduction of Medicare and compulsory superannuation—two safety nets that are now taken for granted by every Australian. In a budget of $350 billion, surely we can find in our hearts, if not our finances, the additional dollars. The Productivity Commission certainly thinks we can find the money. We just need the political will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are fortunate enough in my electorate of Riverina to have wonderful organisations such as Valmar at Tumut and Kurrajong Waratah based in Wagga Wagga, which dedicate their care, expertise and services to provide support for people with disabilities as well as independence and reassurance to their families. On August 15 I was proud to open the Tumut waste and recycling centre, which is staffed by people from Valmar as well as people from the local Tumut Shire Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 27 July 2011 I toured many of the establishments fostered by the people of Kurrajong Waratah, which has a fantastic administration. The Chief Executive Officer, Steve Jaques, and Communications Manager, Cathie Smith, were justifiably proud to take me around and remind me of the opportunities for people who might otherwise struggle to find meaningful employment in everyday life. Kurrajong Waratah offers services to all ages and is not restricted to just helping people with disabilities but also helps their families, carers and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People with a disability, their families and their carers want to participate in the social, economic and cultural life of the nation, but there are many barriers to their full inclusion, and this is something Kurrajong Waratah breaks down. Starting from a young age with Kurrajong Early Childhood Intervention Service, Kurrajong provides an early childhood intervention service for many families who have a child aged from birth to school entry age with a disability or developmental delay in two or more areas. The services it offers can often lead to the child never needing assistance from Kurrajong Waratah again, which is the main aim of the centre. For children who go on to need assistance, a lot is offered in later life to keep disabled people in everyday society at their own pace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lack of support and services means families are primarily responsible for meeting the needs of their family member who has a disability. Many families struggle with high rates of physical, emotional and financial stress. That is why Kurrajong provides the optimum quality of service, from a children's and adolescent's accommodation support service that provides group home accommodation in Wagga Wagga for school-age children who have a disability to RetireLink in Leeton, which provides a flexible service that responds to the changing needs of people with disabilities who are ageing. It offers its clients opportunities to develop new interests, maintain skills and enjoy community participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kurrajong Waratah, which commenced operations in 1957, with the aim of meeting the needs of people with a disability and their families, has done so for the people of the Riverina-Murray areas ever since and has done wonderful job. Its aim continues today, with more than 700 babies, children and adults receiving their services and support daily. It focuses on the ability and the potential of the individual. Kurrajong continues to ensure that its programs are designed to create awareness in the community of the needs and abilities of people with disabilities and their families. The community education program helps draw public attention to the needs and aspirations of babies, children and adults with disabilities and their families. It creates greater awareness of their capabilities and of the significant contribution they can make to the life of their community. Unfortunately, not all areas are as lucky as mine. However, in saying this Kurrajong Waratah covers only a portion of southern New South Wales. We need more services and help for society's most vulnerable. I am proud to say my predecessor Kay Hull, who is a wonderful and true humanitarian, is now a director of Kurrajong Waratah and is continuing her dedication and work for the people of the Riverina in that capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic case for reform for the national disability insurance scheme has been described in terms of the number of people with a disability increasing significantly in the next 20 years, while at the same time the number of people willing and able to provide unpaid care will fall. Government is responsible for funding the difference between the two. The resulting increase in costs has the potential to overwhelm state treasuries. If current growth continues, the amount spent on specialist disability services alone will double in 14 years. A national disability insurance scheme will ensure governments have the ability to meet current and future needs, whatever the economic climate. It will also provide other important economic benefits. As I say, I see it as an investment. By focusing on early intervention and identifying those support services that are most effective and efficient, the scheme will maximise the potential and facilitate greater independence for those who most need it. By providing people with what they need, when they need it the scheme will ensure people with a disability, their families and carers every opportunity to reach their full potential. Providing people with a disability with what they need and when they need it should also reduce the pressure currently experienced by families and able them to more fully participate in work, life and the community. It will also allow them much-needed respite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme could be funded by all taxpayers through general revenue or through Medicare type levy. That will have to be worked out. The modelling needs to be worked out, but as I say the Productivity Commission has said that we can do it. If the commission says we can do it, then surely we can find hopefully through bipartisan support the political will to do it. Funding for essential care, support services, therapy, aids and equipment could then be drawn from this consistent pool of funds. The principal beneficiaries would be those people whose disability has a significant impact on their daily life. Most importantly the scheme would provide support no matter how that disability was acquired. People born with a disability or who acquire a disability through accident, injury or as a result of a medical condition or with a mental illness would all be eligible for assistance. Eligibility for the scheme would be transparent based on careful assessment. A system would be person centred and individualised, based on the choices of the person with a disability and their family. It would focus on early intervention and provide those supports which produce the best long-term outcomes. It would maximise opportunities for participation and productivity. The system would be fair, efficient and equitable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are difficult issues which must be confronted before the scheme can be introduced, such as eligibility criteria and levels of benefit. The interface between the disability, aged and health care sectors must also be assessed. That is why the productivity commission has been given the responsibility for conducting an inquiry into a national disability long-term care and support scheme, an inquiry which they have found can be managed, can be funded and should be funded by government. The commission was aided in its work by a commissioner with specialist expertise in disability, as well is an independent expert panel. The commission conducted public consultations as part of the inquiry and accepted written submissions. At this point I have to praise the efforts of councillor Anne Napoli at Griffith, who recently held a morning tea to raise awareness of NDIS. No one in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area has done more to raise the awareness and push the case for an NDIS than Anne Napoli; I commend her everything she has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A disability could happen to anyone at any time. All Australians deserve the peace of mind which would come with knowing that support will be there if they need it. We all benefit from a more inclusive, more diverse community, and this is why the NDIS scheme is favourable, necessary and an investment in our nation and why organisations such as Kurrajong Waratah need more than ever our ongoing help and funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has records of station closures since February 2008 in its database of observing stations, as indicated below. It should be noted that a turnover of some 240 rainfall stations in a network of some 7000 such stations during this period equates to an annual turnover of around one percent per annum. The number of new stations opened was about the same as the number that ceased reporting so the overall network was held at close to the same size.</span>

Service with the Enhanced Co-operation Program (ECP) in Papua New Guinea between 2004 and 2005 was deemed as a capacity building mission and not a peacekeeping mission. Subsequently, members who participated in the program are not entitled to the POSM. There are currently no awards within the Australian Honours system for police officers serving overseas in a capacity building role. AFP members may be nominated and receive awards under the AFP's Internal Awards Framework.</span>
